I know a lot of people have been asking Obama to do something about the problem in the Gulf, but what exactly can he do? I mean, there isn't much any president, Democrat or Republican, can do about the results of a natural disaster, and from what I can tell he's already ensuring that BP will pay for the losses and it seems to me that the cleanup efforts are federally endorsed.

He isn't accepting any money from corporations or Pacs/Super PACs, which I think is awesome. Sadly, because he doesn't have as much money, he's not getting as much attention (yes, aware there are probably other reasons). He agrees with points both from the Tea Party and the Occupy movement. He owned a bank that was not hit very hard by the recession (missing citation). He is the former Gov. of Louisiana and he has been a congressman. 

He was a Democrat for some of his career, but is now running as a Republican.

I have to tell you guys, I'm interested.

Anyway- just really curious about r/republicans' opinion. 



Hello r/republican. Politically Moderate podcast talk show host here, I am seeking some input from you guys about how you feel the Iowa caucuses reflect on the race, and what we might expect out of NH &amp; SC. 

In particular if any of you here might bring some good insight, I might enjoy having you on the show. 

The show is an attempt to bring a moderate &amp; balanced voice to politics. You can find it [here](http://urbannerd.com), it's real and depending on our guest we garner up to 1000 listens per show. Listenership has grown steadily in the last few months since we began. 
We are high school students in an AP statistics class and hope to catch a glimpse of the great reddit hivemind for our project.   

It is not meant to be in depth but a quick overview of a few simple ideas. 

The survey is a quick few questions and we hope you will take it.    
[Survery Link](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/761001/Political-Affiliation)    

Ask questions if you want.    

If you took the survey, we thank you.    
If you upvoted this self post so that it has more exposure, we thank you.    



I'm curious why Republicans have no love for Huntsman?  I'm not trying to be provocative, I'm genuinely curious.  Huntsman has an impeccable resume, he's well educated, he's served under three presidents, he has foreign policy experience, he speaks Chinese fluently, he understands science, he has business experience, he was a very successful governor of Utah, etc, etc.  I just don't get why he gets no love.  I voted for Obama in '08 but would gladly give my vote to a Republican like Huntsman.  Again, I'm not trying to provoke but I just don't regard many of the other GOP candidates as serious thinkers.  I think if you guys nominated a moderate you'd get a lot more crossover votes like mine.  If your goal is truly to get Obama out, I think Huntsman is the way to go.  
I welcome your input.      

I mean, I'm a centrist, but it seems Mitt Romney has a lot of credibility going for him and a lot of the GOP still doesn't like him.





















Serious question.
Hello, I have had this domain for a while now, and I created these countdown clocks.  They are similar to George Bush countdown clocks during the last election.  I have sold maybe 5 of them by posting in forums, but I don't really understand internet marketing, seo, etc... Would you guys give the site a look over and let me know how I can improve it, although I am not that great at creating website.  This is just a wordpress blog with an add-on.

The site is http://www.theobamacountdown.com  Also any help with suggestions on how to advertise it besides forums.  I am not sure if I could create a facebook page or if it is against their terms of service.  Thanks
























Seriously, your political party has shit its pants and ran off the cliff of insanity. What gives?






























































































































Here's the deal r/politics: The people that upvote stuff like Santorum supposedly saying the "*n-word*" are the people that are the exact equivalent to the people they hate so much on the other side. Its *only* okay to use dirt-tactics *against* the 'bad guys', but when they do it... fucking **OUTRAGE!!!**

Americans are riddled with double-standards, be it Democratic, Republican, Pro-, Anti-Santorum/Obama, it doesnt matter. Everyone feels entitled to attack each other in blissful ignorance.

Sad but true..


If I understand it correctly Ted Cruz is looking to change the way taxes are done kind of drastically. For instance doing away with the Earned Income Credit. Ben Carson as well has talked about doing away with the IRS. My question is in both of these instances do these men need to work with Congress in anyway to achieve these things? Or could either of them on day one implement these plans 100 percent legally with Congress having zero say in the matter legally speaking? I'm not saying I support or don't support either plan I'm just curious how much of it is in their control. I don't want to vote or not vote for someone based on a plan that in all realistic likelihood wouldn't happen. 


Hi guys!  
First I am not a Republican. I just would like to understand what a 100% Republican federal budget would look like.  
Here is our current budget:  
http://www.usfederalbudget.us/budget_pie_gs.php  
If you could wave a magic wand, how would this pie chart look afterwards?  
  
Here are the current categories for your convenience:  
* Defense  
* Pensions  
* Health care  
* Education  
* Welfare  
* General Gov.  
* Interest  
* Other  

Thanks!
I'm a Canadian immigrant to the States, and I'm trying to follow what's going on in the Republican party right now. I'm liberal, but like many here I'm pretty concerned about Trump. I want to know what (if any) options are available to the Republican party if Trump gets the nomination and they just can't let that happen - but I don't know enough about how the party is structured to really know the rules (It works quite differently in Canada - we only vote for the party, and the party leader is chosen by the party. Then the person decided on by the party becomes the Prime Minister if the party is elected).

Can anyone direct me where to find that information? Or already know an article that breaks down the GOP's options?

Far to many posts getting downvoted to 0, someone's hot and bothered by the debate.





I figured this would be the best place to ask this. I'm leaning heavily towards Bernie Sanders. All issues of electability aside, what are the reasons I should NOT vote for him?



[removed]


I'm too proud of our heritage of making America something to be proud of to let it fall into the hands of a man like Rubio, Romney or lying Ted Cruz. MAGA fellow centipedes!
I don't think that there's any denying that there's a new republican party. Up until 6 weeks ago, I was a Democrat- and all of my friends have also joined the party. But let me be clear here- the GOP shouldn't squander this movement. In my opinion, here's what needs to change:

* Moving away from identity politics and "Social Conservatism". I don't give one solid fuck about what someone is doing in the bedroom. Ted "Nuke The Gays" Cruz is a prime example of what I'm talking about. I've got gay friends. Do we sit around and talk about cock and balls all day? Fuck no! Because we're adults. I don't give a shit what people do in the bedroom. Gay marriage is legal now. Great- now they can be as miserable as I am and we've got something to talk about. But all this social policy bullshit takes the focus away on all of the important things going on: Immigration. National Security. Bringing jobs back. Being the uncontested global leader. This thought that you've got to meet some religious, evangelical metric is absurd. Watching the debates this cycle, I was halfway expecting Ted Cruz to trot out a gay person and hang them on stage just to prove how conservative he is. Stop pandering to Evangelicals for support. We don't need them. They can either join the movement or get left behind.

* Down with the Establishment. The old ways are over. If you have any doubt about that- take a look at how well Mitt Romney's hit speech went over last week. The days of grid-locking congress forever and a goddamned day because you don't want to deal with the other side, are over. Big Money PACS and lobbying groups are done. The fucking Koch Brothers reign of terror and hold on the GOP is over. This is a movement.

* We've got to heal. The rift in America is larger than we've ever seen. If we're going to become great once more, we've got to work with the other side. Look at Reagan and Tip O'Neil. They came together to get shit done.

* No more globalism. We've got to fight for our own interests both here and abroad. No more bad trade deals. No more pandering to trade groups and foreign interests. America is our number one focus moving forward.


Anyway, those are my two cents. My friends and I came here via Trump's Nationalist / Populist message and we're here to stay. The old GOP is dead.

I'll go first. I dislike the bat shit crazy religious people that the GOPe attracts






I just wanted to start a discussion about some areas where compromise could be made in Congress so we could actually get some shit done. I was thinking about the Keystone Pipeline in class today and was wondering why we don't try something like this:

**Democrats:** Want renewable energy.

**Republicans:** Want Keystone XL pipeline.

**Compromise:** We do the pipeline, but Republicans have to agree to a 30 year plan to convert to 100% renewable energy sources. 6 years after Keystone is active, we must be at 20% renewable energy. 12 years after, 40%, etc. Creates jobs in oil feild and jobs in renewable energy sector. Gives energy companies time to convert so they can still exist and make a profit.

Is there a reason compromises like this don't get made? The above is just an example thought out by a junior Kinesiology major, obviously not something that would be 100% effective but I think it gets the the principle of my idea across.

I understand that this sub was created out of a hunger for open conservative discussion about many conservative candidates and issues. As such, I feel that we already have our echo-chamber in /r/the_donald and *this* is the medium where we can talk about *different* ideas that may not be part of Trump's campaign. Because I think living in an echo-chamber is a bad thing, I decided to look into Ted Cruz's policies and outline them here in case anyone is interested in discussing other candidates. I won't be doing a write-up for Marco Rubio or Kasich because this is a lot of work and neither of them have a particularly good chance of becoming the nominee.

#[Tax Plan](https://www.tedcruz.org/tax_plan_summary/)
* Ted Cruz's tax plan results in one single tax rate for all individuals and families: 10%.

* The first $36,000 of income is not taxed for families of four.

* [Business Flat Tax - Flat 16%](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/ted-cruz-s-business-flat-tax-primer)
    * This closes all loopholes
    * This is essentially a VAT Tax, and [according to the Tax Foundation](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/ted-cruz-s-business-flat-tax-primer), the 16% business flat tax would essentially act as a 19% sales tax.
    * This is "a powerful tax that captures pretty much all of the income in the country."

* The creation of Universal Savings Accounts which allow $25,000 in tax-deferred savings, which can be withdrawn at any time for any reason to encourage savings and investment.

* Eliminate:
   * Death Tax
   * Overseas profits tax
   * Alternative Minimum Tax
   * Obamacare taxes

* The Tax Foundation reports that Cruz's plan would [cut taxes by $3.6 trillion over the next decade on a static basis. However, the plan would end up reducing tax revenues by $768 billion over the next decade when accounting for economic growth.](http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-senator-ted-cruz-s-tax-plan) It should be noted that [Donald Trump's tax plan](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform) is estimated to [cut taxes by $11.98 trillion over the next decade on a static basis. However, the plan would end up reducing tax revenues by $10.14 trillion over the next decade when accounting for economic growth.](http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-s-tax-plan)

* Also supports [Auditing the Federal Reserve](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/12/sen-ted-cruz-cosponsors-rand-pauls-audit-the-fed-bill/)
    * He co-sponsored the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015 with Rand Paul. [He also missed the vote for that bill.](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/265614-rand-paul-rip-cruz-for-missing-audit-the-fed-vote)

# [Spending Cuts](https://www.tedcruz.org/five-for-freedom/)
* Abolish four cabinet agencies:
    * Department of Education
    * Department of Energy
    * Department of Commerce
    * Department of Housing and Urban Development
    * Eliminate 25 other agencies (listed in the link above)
* Abolish the IRS
* Reestablish the Grace Commission, a group of business leaders to assess federal spending levels and evalutate areas of waste and fraud.

* Establish a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution
* Pass the REINS Act to stop giving Congress a backdoor to expanding federal expenses. 

#[Secure the Border](https://www.tedcruz.org/issues/secure-the-border/)

* Secure the border; "Border security is national security."

* Build a wall that works

* Triple border security

* Put surveillance and biometric tracking on the border

* End amnesty on day one of his Presidency

* Increase deportations

* Stop Sanctuary policies

* Strengthen E-verify

* Suspend and audit H-1B visas and halt increases in legal immigration while American unemployment is so high

#[Defend the Nation](https://www.tedcruz.org/issues/defend-our-nation/)
* Exert leadership on a global stage

* Fiercely defend allies and interests

* Secure the border ("Border security is national security")

* Repeal the Iran deal

* Supports [arming the Kurds and ramping up airstrikes](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/10/ted-cruz-arm-kurds-step-up-astrikes-to-destroy-isl/?page=all) to stop ISIS.


#[Support Israel](https://www.tedcruz.org/issues/stand-with-israel/)
* America's security is significantly enhanced by a strong Israel.

* Strengthen our partnership with Israel by supporting cooperative efforts such as missile defense to counter terrorism.

* No American tax dollars will go to Palestinian Authority, as it seeks to partner with terrorist group Hamas. 

* Defund United Nations if it continues anti-Israel bias

#[Religious Liberty](https://www.tedcruz.org/issues/religious-liberty/)

* Staunchly pro-life

* [Opposes gay marriage with anti-gay marriage Amendment](http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Ted_Cruz.htm)

* Plans to investigate Planned Parenthood

Question for Republicans...Millennials now outnumber Baby Boomers, who are starting to die off. How will the GOP attract young people to the Republican party after writing off the entire generation as being stupid, lazy and entitled? Donald Trump's supporters demographics are 91% white, but less than 2% under 30. How can Republicans stay competitive nationally without the support of minorities and the young?

Super Tuesday 3 showed us a frightening poll for Republicans.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mini-super-tuesday-23-gop-trump-supporters-vote/story?id=37671288

The article discusses that nearly 2/3 of GOP voters that voted Tuesday who don't support Trump would likely vote for a third party nominee in the case that Trump is the nominee.

I don't stay biased to one party or the other. But if you are a die-hard republican, something has to be done about this man; however, it is probably too late. With all of the people that support him matching the amount of people that hating him, one of two things will happen:

1. He will win the nomination, and many Republican voters will either not vote or vote third party, locking in the democratic victory in the general election.

2. He will lose the nomination, and many Republican Trump-Supporters will not vote at all, again locking in the democratic victory in the general election.

Many Trump supporters I know are saying that they now hate the Republican Party because of it's stance against Trump. This is another factor in the likely-death of the GOP.

Like I said, I am not a republican nor a democrat. I simply hate Trump and Clinton. And I would like to see neither of them win; I think the country as a whole would like that too. Because either is extremely dangerous to America. But if Clinton ends up the nominee (which is becoming less likely since a large remainder of the states who have yet to vote have a case of the Berns), she WILL win. The Democrats have already won this election, that's what people don't understand. If you are a bleeding-heart Republican, you should already be scared. Because you've already lost.

How are you able to forgive Donald Trump after he said that he doesn't think John McCain is a war hero because he was captured? I can understand if you don't like John McCain, but that isn't just disrespecting him, it is disrespecting every single POW.  I just can't get behind someone who would say something like that. These people sacrifice so much, and I really don't think he knows the half of it. I'm not trying to attack him or his supporters, I'm genuinely curious how you can get behind someone like this.

The remaining candidates are a bunch of neocons, like Hillary, and quite frankly just aren't conservative.

Sure, some of them may be socially conservative, but is that really what we are looking for? They are all for big government. All for raising taxes. Since when were these the ideals of the republican party? Have you seen some of their comments regarding Brussels and recent terror attacks? They've all been about how we should expand the government so it can deal with these things better, even though quite frankly, it isn't an issue that can easily be dealt with no matter what is done. It feels like I'm watching a more aggressive jimmy carter.

So this brings me to this question. What does the Republican party currently stand for? Why should I continue to support it when it seems as if its values have completely flip? I feel as if conservatism no longer truly exists within our political system. Outside of Rand Paul, I feel like none of the candidates are actual conservatives.

Literally the antithesis of everything they *claim* to represent, yet in actuality they have many similarities when it comes to crushing dissident and seeing attacks on their ideology as *literally* criminal actions that *should* be punishable by law.   

Do they envy Islam and Sharia law? 

Do they perhaps see "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" when it comes to attacking western culture and values?  

Or are they just so spineless that they're willing to capitulate the moment someone who *might actually fight back* comes along?

They always talked about "traditional Christian values" and how they're the bedrock of our society, and if we turn  away from them we'll be in trouble. 

I can't help but notice how the rise of left-wing political correctness/SJWs/cuckoldry/degeneracy coincides with the decline in Christian religiosity. 

I'm still not a big fan of the religious right, I have no beef with gay people, and I'm mildly pro-choice. But even if I think they were wrong on some things, I was wrong to dismiss them completely. 

I think moderate Christianity was good for our country

Hello. So I have always identified as independent but recently have started to think I lean further right. I love personal accountability, small government, the free market, and a strong military. The only thing I tend to disagree with the GOP on would be the issues of abortion, gay marriage, and marijuana. I have always been about the "you do you" attitude that I believe goes along with a smaller less constricting government. I believe in abortion, gay marriage, and at least decriminalization. I am not sure if that makes me more of a Libertarian or some type of Republican? I could never identify as a Democrat because I cannot stand all the handouts and entitlement programs they advocate. Help me?













I wish I had more of a body to add to it, but I don't want to give away location/people involved. I believe in the ideals of my party and I'm willing to continue to fight for them, but I'm at an unstoppable force vs an immovable object impasse at the moment.

What can I do to help shift this viewpoint and assist my candidates further?

There was an article someone posted once on how liberals put conservatives in a no-win scenario on race and diversity and basically it encourages them to not be inclusive.

Couldn't it honestly be said the Democrats put Republicans in a no-win scenario on diversity (mostly on race and demographics)? It's something I see a lot whenever I've seen a discussion on some forums in regards to the party reaching out to new voting groups. 

If there is no diversity in a field of Republicans, Democrats reply "There's no (insert group here), Republicans hate (insert group)!" but if they even half-way tried to make a diverse field, the efforts are seen as tokenism and Democrats use that term like a curse word and a slur.

Why would you bother to be diverse if you're going to be seen as bigoted and your field going to be seen as tokens? As a result of this, Republicans don't bother to become inclusive. It seems like also some Republicans also put their bets on the "missing white voters" idea and not bothering to reach out. The party seems to be on a tightrope on trying to be inclusive without alienating white voters.

I know the party has made some advancements in diversity, but the Obama years showed some of the ugly side of the bigotry of some Republicans that I'm sure future Republicans will look on it with embarrassment. I fear it will get worse if a Democrats wins the White House in 2016.

But however when Republicans becomes inclusive (and not copying the Democrats in terms of reaching out), they win with groups who generally vote Democratic. I look at examples like Tom Kean Sr who won 60% of black voters in New Jersey and Arnold who won in 2006 with various Democratic leaning groups just because he reached out. Tom Kean talked about it in the Politics of Inclusion.

I don't know sometimes, what do Republicans think about this?

I put together this survey for an ethnographic research project I'm doing on participation in the 2016 presidential primaries, as part of an anthropology class at Humboldt State University. If anyone on here would like to take it, I would greatly appreciate it.

I'm also looking to interview people who have been involved in the primary elections. Please message me if you are interested in being interviewed or have any other questions.

Both the survey and interview are completely confidential. The survey is anonymous, so I can't see who has completed it.

I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate post for this subreddit. I will take it down if that is the case.

&gt; - The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.

&gt; - Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.

&gt; - Mind-altering practices (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, and debilitating work routines) are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s).

&gt; - The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (for example, members must get permission to date, change jobs, marry—or leaders prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, whether or not to have children, how to discipline children, and so forth).

&gt; - The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members (for example, the leader is considered the Messiah, a special being, an avatar—or the group and/or the leader is on a special mission to save humanity).

&gt; - The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.

&gt; - The leader is not accountable to any authorities (unlike, for example, teachers, military commanders or ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis of mainstream religious denominations).

&gt; - The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may result in members' participating in behaviors or activities they would have considered reprehensible or unethical before joining the group (for example, lying to family or friends, or collecting money for bogus charities).

&gt; - The leadership induces feelings of shame and/or guilt iin order to influence and/or control members. Often, this is done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion.

&gt; - Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends, and radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before joining the group.

&gt; - The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.

&gt; - The group is preoccupied with making money.

&gt; - Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group and group-related activities.

&gt; - Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.

&gt; - The most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group. They believe there is no other way to be, and often fear reprisals to themselves or others if they leave (or even consider leaving) the group.

I would like this to be a constructive discussion for or against Trumpism exhibiting cultish symptoms. For those for this belief, please provide examples of specific points above. For those against this belief, you're presumed innocent - all you need to do is explain why you're not exhibiting cultish behavior.

The best way to come to a rational conclusion on any basis is through dialog. Ad-hominem is discouraged; actual examples of this behavior are requested.

I think Trump is the worst thing that has happened to the GOP in 40 years. I'd love to know who supports him and who the last member of the GOP is that they supported - and discuss it with you.

If the presidential elections are decided by a handful of swing states do you think that such a polarising figure would actually be able convince the undecided voters to elect him? It seems like a massive gamble. Would the Republican party upper echelons rally behind him?

I'm asking this question from the UK where there is an inverse situation. The Labour party elected Jeremy Corbyn as their new leader and he is very left of centre. It has already seen protest resignations and open dissent in the party as members are convinced that they can't win an election with such a polarising figure.

All I've been able to find so far are clips and commentaries. I would prefer it in 1080p if that's possible. Thanks.

Edit: The best quality I've found so far is in [480] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao7pPjOYWAc.)
**Intro remarks:**

Kasich: Kids think politicians are annoying, but destroying ISIS is good.

Christie: Obama bad. Clinton bad. LA schools closed today. Those kids are scarred for life. And so are their parents. Fathers in LA work, wives don't. I be prosecutor. Me make America safe.

Fiorina: I'm angry, although I look strangely less angry than in any prior debate. I've been called every b-word in the book. Not brilliant, however. I'm not good at applying lipstick.

Bush: I am reading from a textbook. This is my book report. We love to win.

Rubio: I love Las Vegas. My granddad smoked. Obama bad. I love America.

Cruz: America is at war. Obama bad. Clinton bad. Political correctness bad.

Carson: Moment of silence (will be his best moment in this debate, no doubt). I was a doctor. Political correctness bad. Congress should declare war.

Trump: China, Japan, Mexico bad. Iran deal bad. I'm center stage. I'm good enough. People like me. 
**
Wolf: Ban muslims?**

Trump: Security. America is out of control. I will build a wall that will be impermeable to drugs. Cell phones have ISIS flags on them! I'll deport anyone Obama let in.

**Wolf: Is Trump unhinged?**

Bush: Donald is a Chaos candidate.

Trump: Jeb is a LOOOOOSER.

Bush: Obama bad. Our standards are too high. Trump not serious.

Rubio: Obama bad. It's not just a rock in Syria. Obama bad. 

**Hewitt: How do you disagree with Trump?**

Cruz: Obama bad. Clinton bad. Refugees bad. Trump not bad. FDR's grandfather talked about horse thieves. It's not a war on faith, it's a war on theology.

Fiorina: We need solutions. I offer myself. I'm not a lawyer or an entertainer. The iPad was invented in 2011. Twitter! I got a phone call in 2001. I know the private sector. I will ask them.

Christie: Obama bad, Clinton bad. People are scared. Everywhere in America is a target! Obama bad. We need a cabinet.

Kasich: I said last February to restart the last gulf war. Destroy ISIS with our Arab friends. Share intelligence with our European friends. Encryption bad. Pay me now. 

Bash: you voted with Obama

Cruz: I am not going to answer that. I gave us greater tools. Now we have cell phones. Obama bad. We need to stop terrorists before they act.

Rubio: ISIS bad. We need more tools. Cruz took away a tool.

Cruz: Marco is a liar liar pants on fire. it's Alinsky-like.

Rubio: Let me be clear... garble garble.

Paul: Collecting data makes us less safe. Marco is weak on immigration. Really, really weak. Marco loves Chuck E. Schumer.

Rubio: Your bill would keep tourists from Taiwan out. Terrorists are american citizens.

Paul: Every terrorist attack has been legal immigration. Marco weak.

Christie: Senators suck. They are not executives. I made decisions as a prosecutor. No one cares about Marco and Ted and Rand. We stopped four dicks from being attacked by terrorists. 

**Wolf: You want to monitor mosques**

Carson: Let me just complain a bit. (actual quote) We need to be suspicious. Political correctness bad. We are at war.

**Wolf: Rubio or Paul correct?**

Carson: Fuck, I wasn't listening to them!

**Wolf: what about your brother?**

Jeb: We need muslims, lots of muslims. We need a strategy. It needs leadership.

**Wolf: Should tech companies be forced to help the NSA?**

Fiorina: Private sector will help but only if they are asked. That's why healthcare.gov failed.

**Wolf: what does closing internet mean?**

Trump: I want to keep ISIS from doing what they are doing. We should use our minds to keep ISIS from using internet. We can penetrate internet with our brilliant people.

Kasich: We have to hold metadata. We want more, it's good for families. Encryption bad! It's not easy to penetrate! Must penetrate! Encryption bad!
**
Wolf: carpet bomb isis capital?**

Cruz: use air power. worked against iraq army. arm kurds. kill isis where they are. political correctness bad.

**Wolf: so carpet bomb civilians?**

Cruz: I have no idea what carpet bombing actually means. I just think it sounds cool. 

Rubio: ISIS is bad. We need boots on the ground. Arab boots. Our air force is too feeble and weak to bomb ISIS. ISIS is better at propaganda than we are.

**Wolf: What about Cruz?**

Rubio: Yep, Cruz voted against the troops and the Iron Dome. He wants to make our air force have too few bombs to bomb ISIS.
Cruz: I voted against defense funding because I promised Texas voters to do so. Bad guys are bad. Kill bad guys.

Rubio: Obama bad. Hillary bad.

**Facebook person: kill civilians? Isn't that what ISIS does?**

Trump: we have to be tough. Families knew. I would be 'very very firm' with families of terrorists.

Bush: Not serious. Crazy. Trump said 2 months ago that ISIS not our fight. Not serious. He likes Clinton!

Trump: Jeb's nice.

Jeb/Trump: I'm talking! No, I'm Talking!

Trump: With Jeb's attitude, we will never be great again. 

**Hewitt: Can you kill women, kids, destroy villages?**

Carson: Kids don't like to be operated on. Then they love me.

Paul: Regime change is stupid. So is Trump. Have you never heard of the constitution?

Trump: we will infiltrate, not close the internet.

Kasich: We gotta have a coalition and not wait for anyone to join it!

Fiorina: You are ignoring me!

Rubio: Obama bad.

Fiorina: Talking tough not enough. I'm tough. I'm not a senator! Here's the names of some generals that are retired. Obama bad. Didn't quite get the facts right, but hey, I'm Carly. I'm a woman, I get things done.

Christie: I'm not responsible, I'm not a senator. Shit doesn't work in NJ, I get blamed - hell, look at my approval rating! It sucks! I'm gonna stand with a dead King.

Carson: I'm trying hard to repeat my memorized foreign policy lines. And I'm not going to call it Hummus again! We should put boots on the ground if anyone says we should. 

**Wolf: you like dictators, don't you?**

Cruz: Obama bad, Hillary bad. Democrats toppled Gaddafi, Mubarak. Let's keep Assad.

**Wolf: You supported Obama! Rubio: Gaddafi was going to go anyway. He was scared. Assad bad, I will not cry for him.**

Cruz: Obama funds purple unicorns. I like Netanyahu.

Kasich: Assad's gotta go.

Trump: In my opinion... (protesters...) we wasted $4T

Fiorina: That's what Obama said. Clinton bad!

Trump: Benghazi was a disaster because of Libya (huh?) . Ben's a nice guy but I've been talking about oil for 3 years! Take the oil.

Carson: We need oxygen, the plane is going down. It has been for thousands of years.

Bush: Getting rid of Saddam was good. Obama bad.

Paul: Regime change was bad, Saddam was bad. Everyone still wants regime change. That's what causes terrorism

Cruz: It's not my turn, but I insist on talking. Really, I insist on talking! 

Trump: Assad is a bad guy. Rebels, we don't know who they are.

Christie: Iran nuclear deal created ISIS. Iran is the enemy.

Paul: No, Assad does not need to go.

Kasich: Punch Russia in the nose.

Christie: I would definitely shoot down a russian plane! That's what I wanna do! America, Fuck Yeah!

Paul: Christie is your candidate for WWIII. And by the way, Bridgegate! 

Bush: Awesome line about Trump getting his views from 'shows, saturday morning or sunday morning'.

Trump: meltdown!

Bush: You are a weanie, Trump!

Trump: your poll numbers suck!

Kasich: Let me defuse this by boring you.

**Hewitt: can you be commander-in-chief?**

Carson: I've built things, I'm a doer. I've done stuff. I started a scholarship fund. Bash: Do you still support your immigration bill?

Rubio: I know immigrants. I served with immigrants. Dana, you are no immigrant. But yeah, I'd give them a work permit.

**Bash: You didn't answer the question.**

Rubio: Yeah, and I'm not gonna.

**Bash: Please attack Rubio.**

Cruz: Well, he sucks. He sleeps with Chuck Schumer. Obama bad. Refugees bad.

Rubio: Refugees are different today. Ted is a liar. Ted sucks big donkey balls.

Cruz: I call bullshit. He wants amnesty, I don't.

FIorina: YOU ARE IGNORING ME!

Cruz: Clinton and Bush deported illegal aliens. 

Trump: Wall. Wall. Wall.

**Bash: Are you all being stupid, since you need Hispanic votes?**

Bush: Yep. Obama bad. Hillary bad. 

**Wolf: You thought refugee camps were nice.**

Carson: Yep. They want to stay, and then go home. There are airstrips in Syria. We should give Kurds weapons. We need to choose right choice.

Paul: Marco loves Chuck E. Schumer.

Christie: I was a prosecutor. End of conversation. Women are evil.

Kasich: Ohio is terrorist-free. Except for the minors. 

Fiorina: Kim Jung Un dangerous. Previous administrations failed. So we should keep doing the same things. China bad.

Carson: Kim Jung Un dangerous. We should use our economic power. Same for Putin. And buy more subs and missles and planes.

Christie: We'll embarass China. That'll teach 'em.

Bush: Press should be hacked by China. That'll teach 'em.

**Hewitt: What about the nuclear triad?**

Trump: I was against going into Iraq. Nuclear proliferation is bad. I have no fucking idea what 'triad' means, even though it was obvious from the prior question.

Rubio: I will explain what 'triad' means. I studied for this test!

Bash: Cruz=maniac?

Trump: nope.

**Bash: You bashed (ha ha) Trump in private. Wanna repeat that?**

Cruz: I'll ignore your question. My daughters are here. LA schools were closed today. I'm answering the question! He's better than Obama or Clinton. I'm answering the question! 

Trump: I'm in it to win it.

Carson: "Rinse Pubis" assured me that nothing bad was going on.
**
Next up: closing statements!** 

Paul: We spend lots of money. It's not a good idea. No one else agrees.

Kasich: I'm from Ohio. America is Ohio.

Christie: I was a prosecutor.

Fiorina: I put security procedures in place at HP after 9/11. Hillary bad.

Bush: Hillary and Obama bad. My record is fortified.

Rubio: blah blah blah

Cruz: Obama bad. Winning. Reagan bankrupted Soviet Union, I will do the same.

Carson: I've been to 58 countries. My mother said anything was possible. Then I hit her with a hammer.

Trump: America not winning. Win a lot. Great country.

(Thanks Barfo!)

We're having an election over at the Model House of Commons, /r/mhoc. This is [the Conservative's manifesto](http://conservatives.dudaone.com/) and please visit [this thread to vote](http://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/2kew00/general_election_megathread/). We're a party supporting sensible economic policy, respect of freedoms and further localism.  
Thank you.
























Does anyone else experience this? When I'm talking with a group of people and politics come up and I end up sharing that I am a republican, most of the people that see themselves a democrats freak out and ask how I can be a republican, however when its the other way around, most republicans I have meet couldn't care less about the other persons political party.





































If abortion was legal, the only people that would have it are liberals that shouldn't be reproducing anyways. Let natural selection take it's course!









































































If there are any Rubio fans out there they announced yesterday from Freedom Tower in Miami. I threw some money at them today and I'm getting a "Day One Supporter" T- Shirt. If you are down with it the swag is available for 9 more hours (as of now) on MarcoRubio.com. 

It looks like a fairly diverse field. So far nobody I wouldn't vote for. 













Hello everyone! ModelUSGov is now holding elections. Recently, the Republicans have been facing major opposition from the Democrats and the Green-Lefts. We need your support to keep our current majority of seats for the Republicans and to put a Republican in the White House.


It won't take long to vote and we would really appreciate everyone's support. (By the way, for the Presidential candidates, /u/IBiteYou and /u/2adamstoon are the Republicans.)

What type of service leadership do you think Ronald Reagan had throughout his presidency.

For example, he helped people who were homeless get off the streets or he helped Israel after WWII.






Hey there, fellow Republicans,

I'm currently the Republican nominee for President over at /r/ModelRepublicans, the Republican party in /r/ModelUSGov, itself being a sub-reddit similar to /r/MHOC. 

If you're unfamiliar with the model government sub-reddits, they're Redditors' attempts at mimicking real life governments. We elect representatives, debate issues that effect our nation, and vote on legislation. 

Sound interesting? Come on over! Have any questions? Feel free to ask, and thank you for your time!











Would it be possible to craft legislation that would require a voter ID, while limiting the harm it may cause to voter turnout?

Liberals are suspicious of voter ID laws, because they see it as an attempt to suppress turnout of liberal voters (who are less likely to have an ID paperwork). I am sympathetic to this, but I also understand those who feel it is common sense to require an ID to vote.

But what if you had something like this:

* Require all voters to show an ID, but delay or somehow phase in the requirement for 5 years
* Between now and the requirement deadline, fund programs which help those without voter IDs to attain them.
* Fund additional programs to encourage people to register and vote.

Supporters of voter ID requirements would get the fraud-preventing measures they're looking for, while those who are suspicious of voter ID laws would get some protection against what they really fear - suppression of the vote.

I know I'm making big assumptions about politicians ability to compromise, but a man can always dream...































What do you have to lose? Nothing! What do you stand to gain? Perspective. 

To those who outright refuse, what are you afraid of? 


























































Is there automatic downvoting or is the content really bad?





Do you?







































ELI5:Why should I Vote for Republicans this election day! 


























Participating in the nomination process is a social contract: If your gal (or guy) wins the nomination, you want the party to fall in behind  her (or him), even if (s)he wasn’t their first choice—verily, even if (s)he was their *last* choice. We all participated, we all had our say, the party made a decision, and if it comes out in our favor, if Cruz wins, we expect the Rubio voters to others to bow to that choice (or at least knuckle under) and vice-versa. But that only works, and it’s only a reasonable demand, if we are willing to *ourselves* bow to the choice if it comes out against *our* preferences. If you won’t support Romney if he wins, why in the world would you expect anyone to support Gingrich if he should win? If you won't support Ford if he should be nominated, how can you expect Ford voters to support Reagan if *he*'s nominated?

Lest I be accused of hiding my cards, I'll be frank: Donald Trump is no conservative’s idea of a conservative—he's a fraud, a charlatan, an interloper, an invasive disease, and I hope that he doesn’t get the nomination. 

But say that he does. If you won’t support Trump if he should get the nomination, are you not violating the very social contract by which you hope to bind his supporters to vote for Fiorina/Cruz/Rubio/whomever-you-support if *they* should be nominated?

Let's keep our eyes on the prize: Barack Obama *cannot* be succeeded by Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. That's job one, whomever the nominee may be.

I'll admit that I've never considered myself to be a Republican.... but it's horrendous for me, as an American who cares about the future of my country to see the party torn apart as it has been, during this election season with the drama surrounding Donald Trump. Obviously, he is not seen as a viable candidate to represent the Republican Party's values into the future. Or at least that's the impression I get from watching the other presidential candidates in interviews.

I find it very fascinating that Fox News seems to have lifted him up so high, in the time they alot to different people. They seem to have been playing a game with trying to swing their influence in this election cycle. 

I was a boy in 1980, but I remember how the advent of the first cable news network - CNN - was instrumental in changing the tide on behalf of Ronald Reagan. Reagan was not thought of as being a serious candidate, early in the campaign... and yet, he won in a landslide... after national opinion shifted.

My thought is that Republicans, since they have seem to have lost the loyalty of cable news, when it comes to actually getting their conservative agenda popularized and implemented, would see fit to institute a new, and honestly conservative cable news network. If someone doing this is looking for ideas for journalistic principles that are wholesome, and which support community and family values, it might be wise to look north of the border at Canada's journalism.

Certainly, one thing that such a news agency should make clear to young Americans is that the door to the Republican Party is always open for anybody who has new ideas about a business they want to start as an entrepreneur, or anyone who wants to climb aboard and be a part of these projects.

I remember a Masonic (conservative) "leadership conference" I attended when I was a highschool kid. It was very encouraging to me that adults would take youth into these kinds of classes and try to help them toward their future. I've never seen anything like it provided by the Democratic Party or any other left wing organizations. The Democratic Party doesn't seem particularly interested in giving young people the kinds of real world opportunities that the Republicans have traditionally been interested in providing for them.

Here on Reddit, there are SO many anxious young people who are kind of mad at the world, and have lost their faith in the direction of their country. Young people like this need someone to take them under their wing, and give them the opportunity to pursue their business ideas.

There's someone trying to push an initiative in California that would require politicians to literally wear logos of their supporters on their sleeves. That'll be invalidated if it ever passed for both 1st amendment and compelled speech reasons.

This is a suggestion that gets the same results without those problems.

So I've grown up in a polotically neutral household me whole life and with the upcoming political election I have to wonder: Why does anybody hate Bernie and Hilary? Please tell me what they have done or said that makes them unfit to be president.  I understand the complaints from the democratic side of the debate (Trump saying he will stop Muslims from coming here, Cruz saying he'll stop planned parenthood, etc.) but I haven't seen any real evidence that Bernie and Hilary are bad people/presidential candidates

Let me preface this by saying I'm not here to troll, I just want to see what the real world arguments from true conservatives are concerning this topic, as opposed to what MSM is saying.


My concerns are as follows:


 - I understand there is hypocrisy between the democrats. But that doesn't mean they were right when they were talking about blocking nominations. I believe what they were saying was wrong and that no senate should block the nom, no matter how close the next election. But that's easy for me to say, as I was like 5 years old when Biden said these things.


 - There are no precedents in successfully blocking a nomination in the last year of a presidential cycle. In fact, the opposite is true. In 1912, Taft elected Pitney in his last year. In 1916, Wilson elected Clarke and Brandeis. In 1932, Hoover elected Cardozo in his last year. In 1940, Roosevelt elected Murphy.


 - Out of the last four presidents who served 2 terms, all of them successfully made nominations to the Court of Appeals in their last year. Including GW Bush.


 - The "Thurmond Rule" is described as "prohibiting nominees in the few months leading up to presidential elections." While this can be argued by semantics, Obama has &gt;9 months left in his presidency. He's not anywhere close to leaving office.


Again, I'm not trying to come off as argumentative, I simply want to know what you all think and what arguments you have against the appointment of a new Supreme Court Justice.

Hi, I'm a researcher at Columbia University in NYC and we are seeking male Republicans under 30 years of age for a paid EEG experiment.

Participants will be paid $30 for 2 hours of their time. They are required to watch 61 minutes of the 2012 Presidential Debate Videos while being observed using EEG (so a wet gel will need to be applied to the scalp).

If you are interested please PM me. Thanks!







Rep. Amash's (R-MI) amendment that would have defunded the NSA's phone collection program nearly passed yesterday, with 205 members of Congress voting for it. That means 205 members of Congress went on the record against the NSA's blanket phone record collection program — and that we are only 7 representatives away from getting a majority in Congress to oppose the NSA's unconstitutional overreach.

This August, Congress will return home for their annual recess. This is the perfect time for some grass-roots lobbying. Every year Free Press organizes a number of in-district meetings between our members and their local legislators during the August recess. This year we made an online tool that lets local activists organize meetings themselves.

Scheduling in-district meetings would be an extremely effective strategy for anyone who cares about this issue. Setting up the meeting is relatively easy -- much easier than planning a protest. Each meeting only needs 4-8 activists dedicated to attending. And in our experience, they really do make a difference. These politicians spend the entire year listening to corporate lobbyists, and August is their one-month window to hear personal stories from constituents.

You can find the event tool here. If you enter your zip code it'll show you the meetings already planned near you, or if there are none, encourage you to schedule your own. If reddit's Republican community dedicates itself to this effort, we could reach a significant portion of Congress and achieve substantial reform once they reconvene.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns in the comments. If you'd rather not go through the event tool to schedule a meeting, email me at ngordon@freepress.net and I can walk you through the process.

Which would you prefer as POTUS?
most of the posts are from non-republicans hassling the republicans anyhow. What's the point?






And this is because they charge interest on every cent created. I effect keeping america in debt and in my opinion enslaved to the major banks. Opinions critiques, anything at all to say about this?

tldr; do republicans truly know how our money is made?







Dear Elizabeth Warren,

It has come to my attention that you’ve made a statement which has given you a lot of internet recognition on a number of social networking sites. I congratulate you on your fifteen minutes of fame which will probably be cut short by another obscure person’s witty quote. Before you join the ranks of other internet memes such as Rebecca Black and the “Y U No…” guy please allow me to reply to your call for me to “pay it forward”. 

First off, I went to public school from kindergarten through high school. I graduated with 1200 other people that all received the same education. My parents did not have money for college and I knew that if I wanted a college education I would have to fund it myself. I chose to spend my high school nights studying with the hope that my grades would lead to a college scholarship. I had friends, but we weren’t the cool kids that went out every weekend and prioritize other activities before our education. I graduated close to the top of my class and as a result of my hard work I received a full ride to a state college. Some of the “cool” kids that I mentioned earlier were also from meager backgrounds but their grades were not impressive enough to earn them any type of assistance for college. Some went to community college and others decided to take factory jobs. 

In college I had to maintain a very high grade point average to retain my scholarship. This meant many hours in the library and even the occasional sleepless night. Since my room and board was not covered I also had to maintain a part time job so that I could pay my rent and eat. My friends were limited to my study partners and my romantic life was virtually non existent. I never had the time to attend house parties, go on spring break trips, or attend homecoming football games.

Toward the end of my college education I managed to secure a few internships with some successful companies. Through the impressions that I made at these companies I had no problem finding a job long before I graduated. The work ethic that I had instilled in myself in high school and college carried over and as a result I quickly progressed up the corporate ladder. After a few years I took advantage of my company’s tuition reimbursement plan and went to school at night to get my MBA. 

While in graduate school I met other successful professionals and a few of us eventually decided to quit our jobs and start our own company. Lucky for us the gamble paid off and within five years I was able to buy out my partners. 

Today I provide stable employment for over 1000 people at my factory and solicit the services of multiple other companies, all which employ American citizens. I pay the county, state, and federal taxes which are required of me and assume that those monies go toward upkeep of the surrounding infrastructure, schools, police department, fire department, and US armed forces. In addition, my company donates money and volunteer efforts to the local community as a way of improving the quality of life of our neighbors. 

I suppose I should reemphasize the fact that my company is based in the US and is employing US workers. Maybe you’ve forgotten about the number of companies packing up and moving oversees or to Mexico where they can produce the same products at a fraction of the price. Even the “Big 3” which were supposed to be the last glimmer of hope for the American Dream are more reliant on goods produced overseas then they are on domestic made products. Where are the proposals and cute internet quotes proposing higher taxes and tariffs on them? Last I checked the shelves of the local Wal-Mart were fully stocked with goods made anywhere but the United States. 

I got to where I am today through my own hard work and ingenuity. I understand that there are some CEOs out there that had it slightly easier than I, but they would not still be where they are without a strong work ethic and the knowledge that success is earned. I never received anything I didn’t work for and I find it insulting that you are trying to exploit my hard work for the benefit of those that have different priorities. 

Rather than jumping on the Washington DC bandwagon and blindly calling for more jobs and higher taxes, ask yourself “Where did the jobs and extra tax revenue go?” Penalize the companies that choose to bypass the American worker while trying to sell to his neighbor.  These are your crooks and your criminals. These are the people that exploited the system to increase their profit margin. Why aren’t they being asked to “pay it forward”? 

Regards

CEO of American Company 

This is my opinion. It would be the greatest thing ever if the 2012 election was between two awesome people and we had to choose the most awesome one. 


Politicians often are involved in scandals. What do you have on Ron Paul or Jon Huntsman Jr.? ya know those little candidates that don't have a shot at the nomination but still have to get some publicity.

As far as I can tell they have clean records. Got anything that says otherwise?

[H.R. 1233](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1233) changed the Federal Records Act of 1950 to include electronic communications. It was signed into law by Obama in November 26, 2014. This is AFTER Hilary Clinton stepped down.

-------


[It gets better:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtyf4nWP4EM&amp;list=UUXSlyao4qkUFiPqghptHtZA)

&gt;The bill also includes language based on an amendment that Darryl Issa proposed during the committee markup of the bill to address the use of personal email by the federal employees; and that amendment makes the bill even better. This bill will continue to allow employees to use their personal email account for official business when necessary, but it would require employees to copy their official email account or forward their email to their official account.

I have long since subscribed to small government philosophy because I thought the government was so inept.  

I now feel like in the coming decades it is very possible that good technology will be able to run government more efficiently that we ever thought imaginable.  It's possible that these algorithms will be much more efficient than current government and even better that the free market in some respects.

Is this reason to rethink the small government platform?

So, I'm traveling for work and I'm trapped in an airport with CNN going. They were putting on a full length feature on Jeb Bush. Sioux City, Iowa at probably 5:30 AM following NorthEast storm coverage. 

This made me think a few things.

Why is CNN running a glowing endorsement of Jeb Bush? Why is this running in Iowa? It "reads" like the left wants to run against Jeb so they can capitalize on the bush Hate from '04 and '08. That would set us up for yet another base election and what might be the best possibility of Democrat victory.

Now I can tell you as a resident of Florida that Jeb Bush was a competent and popular governor. I liked him. He used to give his addresses in English and then follow on with Spanish. His brother drew a lot of Hispanics in his presidential bids and I would assume Jeb would do as well or better there. The only thing that's really "bad" about the guy is his last name and there are plenty of people who are going to rebel against dynasty.

What do you guys think? I think that Jeb Bush is the person the Democrats want to run against. 

Also obligatory "anyone but Christie". 


































His legacy is scandal. One after another.


Thanks in advance for the replies.































Here is the complete senate information page where you can find your senators:

How exactly does one reconcile advocating gun rights and balking at more stringent gun legislation, especially for mentally ill people, because gun laws equate to second amendment infringments. 

And also saying we need more proactive mental health treatment but not wanting to pay for social welfare programs that would address that need. 

I'm listening.








I am a left-leaning political science major. I've seen that many polls indicate that Trump is leading. Out of every candidate I cannot understand why anyone would vote for him. I am going to vote for Bernie Sanders, but if I had to vote Republican I would vote for Jeb Bush, because he seems less radical than the other candidates.

Honest question. It just seems like they're trying to piss off everyone with an X chromosome.

















Well congrats assholes you pieces of shit got your way.  kicking and screaming like a bunch a faggots.  I think faggot should actually be reassigned to republicans instead of gay people.  Yes all you republicans are faggots and I hope all of you fall into a barrel of aids cancer and you all die slowly while your flesh rots from the inside.

I actually have a really good idea about how to celebrate this shutdown.  You should grab a kitchen knife and just sit on until you die.

Thanks for the shutdown assholes!  Congrats (faggots)!







First off I want to say I'm not a "democrat" and I'm not a "republican". I'm a 23 year old college student who is *fucking* confused about what is going on.

Can someone here please help me try to understand what the republicans are talking about when they say things like:

&gt;It's going to destroy America

&gt;It's the worst thing that's happened in America

&gt;It's unconstitutional

I am openly admitting I don't know a lot about the specifics (which is why I'm here, and asking *you guys*). I've only ever heard, seen and read about republicans (intentionally or not) staying extremely vague about the topic, which to me just says that they don't know anything about it themselves and are either just following suit or getting paid off to say what they are saying.

Please, someone explain to me what these republicans are *trying* to say about Obamacare/ACA. 


I really just want to know if you sometimes experience doubt over your political views as republicans. Is it all clear to you? Is everybody else who has different political views just plain wrong?




I find the two party system destructive to progress between the two. it's a very 'us against them' mentality, both ways. and I find that there's a lot of stuff that if you took it out of the context of 'this is a Republican/Democrat etc view' you'd actually agree with it rather than lock horns about it by principle and never get anything done. I've posted the reverse to the Democrat subreddit http://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/1ontf4/democrats_which_issue_do_you_have_a_conservative/

I am writing to you today to spread some information and encourage membership of the subreddit /r/ModelUSGov. Some of you may have heard of /r/ModelUSGov or are already a part of it, but for those of you that have not heard of it, it is a United States government simulation that tries to follow the real process as close as it can. We have elections coming up soon

The main difference between this sub and the real life government is we have predominant parties other than Democrats and Republicans. Which include:

**The Distributist Party** - Basically socially conservative, religious and fiscally left. 

**The Libertarian Party** - Similar to the real life party. 

**The Socialist Party** - Name says it all.

To join, please go to this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/30mo3w/join_a_party_thread/
) and post interest for your desired party. We are hoping you choose us as we are always looking for new party members!

Elections are approaching in a few weeks, so we'd love to have more conservatives in the subreddit in general! Check it out and if you have any questions, you can ask me. For those worried about the leftist bias of reddit, we do have socialists, but at one point in /r/ModelUSGov the Republicans had a super-majority in the Senate and close to a majority in the House, so it is possible for conservatives to be heard loud and clear.

Thanks,

Republicans should openly and loudly support Obama on the NSA issue and call for an apology to GW.  GOP gets validation of Bush years, Obama admitting how naive he was and a kind of Obama media shield (though his powers seem to be waning.)











































































I'm noticing that the worst may be over for the GOP.  It seems to me (just an opinion) that the nuttier baggage the GOP has been carrying may be transitioning to the Libertarians of all people.  A return to sensibility would certainly be welcome.  What do you think?






































Hello - full disclosure.  I'm a progressive "disgruntled" Democrat. 

On paper, I think progressives - the rank and file at least - have better ideas about how to move the country forward than the rank-and-file conservatives.  But what's interesting is that while I'm a progressive, almost *no* elected Democrats are actually working to solve the country's problems.  (Granted, I feel almost *no* elected Republicans are either.) 

I also have come to the realization that at the rank-and-file level, progressives and conservatives agree far more often than we think we do.  And I'm on Reddit to test out this theory. 

Progressives - at least from what I have experienced - tend to believe that they have good ideas and that conservatives' primary goals are to block those good ideas.  I'm not so sure this is the case.  I think that conservatives believe they have good ideas and that progressives' primary goals are to block *those* ideas as well. 

But when I think about it, when I think: "What do Conservatives want?" I have to think to myself: Well, hell, I can't think of any progressive that would be opposed to 95% of that... 

One of the big issues of conservatives is a balanced budget and lowered national debt.  Heck, progressives want that too.  

Conservatives want less governmental regulation in starting up small businesses, progressives wouldn't mind getting rid of some of the cruft if we made sure not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  

Conservatives want free markets, not crony capitalism... which is something that took me by surprise, because most progressives think that conservatives want crony capitalism, not free markets!  We thought we were the free market people!  

What if we both are? 

And, on the other side, I don't think that conservatives necessarily want to block environmental regulation because they don't like the environment or they don't want clean air or preservation of wildlife.  They just want to also make sure that they have jobs as well.  I don't think conservatives are necessarily against solar power or alternative energy sources so long as they're cost effective.  (And solar has a lot of military uses that conservatives love - getting batteries/fuel shipped in might give away the position of soldiers in the field, but being able to recharge electronics through solar can help keep them safe.)  

I also think that conservatives are necessarily opposed to even basic social services - they just "are tired of paying for other people," as my Dad put it.  

This is my theory: That if conservatives actually pointed out what they actually wanted - that progressives would have no opposition to 90% of it, and if progressives pointed out what they actually wanted, conservatives would have no objection to 90% of it.  

**That's the first part of the theory I want to test: In this thread, can you please point out what you feel *you* want?**  

But if I'm right... then why does it seem like we're 100% opposed to each other?

For that, I have a second part of the theory.  

And that is that we're both being played for chumps.  

See, I think that there are two problems: right now, money is *very important* to running for political office.  95% of house races were won by the candidate who spent the most money.  And due to gerrymandering, (and both sides do it) and "natural" safe-seats, we don't have a very strong ability to hold elected officials accountable on either side of the aisle. 

In short, this has created a strong incentive to keep the significant funders of campaigns happy.  And those funders are not from a broad cross-section of America.  There are only about 150,000 of them, or 0.05% of America - the special interests, corporate and union concerns that fund elections.  

So *neither* of us are going to get the things we think this country needs, let alone what we want - if the funders can effectively use their influence to block reform.  The *same system of corruption that blocks reforms that the left wants also blocks reforms that the right wants.* 

When we ask why Washington is so screwed up, I think it's simply because the Legislature was designed (as stated in Federalist #52) to be "dependent upon the people alone."  But members of congress are far more dependent upon the funders of their campaigns than on the people/the voters.  This creates a mis-aligned incentive, where politicians have to do what's best for the funders *first.* 

This is a "systemic corruption" - a corruption that can't be solved simply by replacing the people in power with someone of an opposing party.  

To be sure, rank and file progressives don't like elected Republicans; but you'd be surprised how little the rank and file progressives like the Democrats as well.  Look at Nancy Pelosi's extended interview on the Daily Show.  She's completely oblivious to the fact that most progressives believe, rightly, that politicians are beholden to the money and not to the voter.  And she believes that the Democratic Party isn't beholden to special interests the way that Republicans are! She clearly does not represent the progressives *I* know!  

She doesn't get it, and she's never going to get it.  And she was until recently our party leader in the legislature! 

I think that Red and Blue have been fighting each other because we've been played one against the other by "green". *That we have more in common with each other than we do with the deep-pocketed interests who wield undue influence over our elected officials in this country.* That our political dysfunction is being bred because crony capitalists are feeding upon that dysfunction.  

And I know that there are some great reformers on both sides of the aisle working towards it: Jim Ruebens (R Sen. Candidate, NH), Fmr. Gov. Buddy Roemer (R-Louisiana), but also Jeff Kurzon (D Cong. Candidate, NY)... and I think that we should find some sort of way to point out the *real* reformers on both sides of the aisle.  I think that most progressives would vote for a Republican who seeks to reform the system over a Democrat who doesn't, and vice versa.  We just need a way to identify them quickly - call 'em "mavericks" (like John McCain) or "rebels" or something. I'd vote for a "Rebel Republican" over a "Democrat" any day.  Because while I might not agree with them on issues #2-#1000, the first issue is this systemic corruption.  Until we fix that issue, we're not going anywhere. 

I actually was talking to a friend of mine who actually *works* for the Democratic Party, and led with this line: "We will have more success advancing an agenda that progressives want in the medium to long term by supporting Republican candidates who work to end systemic corruption than by supporting Democratic candidates who do not." He was flabbergasted by this statement (which stood against everything he "knew" to be "true" in politics), but after convincing him of the need for real reform in how our candidates raise money to run for office, he ended up agreeing with me.  

Cause that's really what's blocking both of us.  We can't get what either of us want until we start addressing this problem. 

We can argue about what form reform can take later, but I believe that we need to first agree that we need reform. 

I'd like to start what I'd like to call a "cross-partisan" movement.  Not bi-partisan, because we don't agree on anything else.  But cross-partisan.  I'm going to do my best to push for reform on the progressive end, but I'd like to lend aid and support where I can to conservatives pushing for reform on the conservative end.  We do not have to work together, but we should be working concurrently towards the same goal.  

**Is this possible?**

I'd really, really like your genuine thoughts on this.

This is being pushed pretty hard by Republicans in Congress so what do you guys think?






Here is another article saying that Hispanics will alter the political map. It seems that once red states are in play thanks to the Latino vote. Apparently few and few states are Republican. Republicans used to own Florida. They use to own California. No more. And like so many articles I have seen, it seems that Texas will flip into the Democrat camp. If you lose Texas, that's the last of the big states voting Republican.

What if anything is the Republican Party doing to change this situation?

I am from a liberal city, (Cleveland, Ohio) and there are a few very general topics that seem to be agreeable to most conservatives that I just don't understand. I am genuinely curious but every time I question my republican friends, they always get so defensive and sometimes angry without explaining anything. (I think this isn't a conservative affliction; in my opinion, people just get too defensive about politics in general.) I thought I would ask this subreddit instead. So, here are my questions:

I understand that conservatives/republicans want small government. Why, then, do they not support marriage equality and pro-choice? These seem like issues that should be private and non-governmental. Is it just a religious-based opinion? And where does separation of church and state come into it? 
For some reason, I can't seem to get an honest answer about this and I would really like to understand. Thank you for your serious answers!

EDIT: thank you so much to everyone who responded! I'm so glad for the information without defensiveness. Thank you for helping me understand better!

So, as the title states, just trying to gain some understanding and generate some healthy discussion from the "enemy" (obviously using that term with complete sarcasm). I feel the rhetoric surrounding political and economic opinion far too often devolves into hate-mongering. So, I'm going to present two of my views; one, a broad/ideological stance, and the other an opinion upon what I perceive as a current political stance of conservative capitalists.  
  
The idea that capitalism cannot sustain itself. The greatest strength of capitalism is its unparalleled growth. However, this is also a profound weakness, the contradiction of unending and ever-growing consumption in the name of growing capital and the finite resources to meet that consumption.
This does lead to incredible innovation, in an almost Darwinian sense, of capitalism's own natural selection of the profitable surviving and the not-so falling to the wayside. However, the point does stand that capitalism cannot survive without continued economic growth. The moment of a stall in that growth, we observe a recession. The cycles of production expansion and recession have been accelerating faster so that economic instability and the crisis/fault of capitalism occurs more often.
  
  
I'm not going to say anything regarding worker exploitation or natural resources.... I feel that's a discussion for a different day.  
  
The current conservative economic policy of providing tax incentives to the wealthy capitalist (as the media refers to them: job creators) is based off of a flawed and incorrect assumptions. For this discussion, I will go ahead and assume these capitalist will utilize their incentives to indeed create jobs to stimulate, for themselves, further revenue. The first flaw I see with this policy is the assumption that these capitalist will be drawn towards creating these jobs here in America. As we've already seen in multiple fields, the ability to outsource labor is becoming more viable by the day and will continue to do so. Why would these capitalists, desiring to increase profit margins and revenue for their corporations, continue to invest in American jobs when the same labor can be obtained elsewhere in the world for much less? So, the first flaw essentially breaks down to a faulty sense of major capitalist's reliance upon the American worker.
...and I do recognize that I'm only discussing major corporations here and I very well could be at fault for doing that.
  
  
The second flaw I see stems from the first. It is an idea that major corporations will be interested in the American worker because those corporations rely upon the American consumer. In an idea stemming straight from Henry Ford, if those companies want their products to be sold, people have to be able to afford them. The issue I'm seeing with this is the marked increase in global advertisement spending in markets other than here. (http://adage.com/article/global-news/10-things-global-ad-market/245572/) The increased revenue being spent in other markets leads me to believe these major corporations are become far more interesting in the consumers of these emerging markets than they are in the American consumer. Now, obviously, this method of looking at ad revenue is slightly skewed as spending in the United States is still vastly ahead in that regard. However, I hope you understand the point I'm trying to make is that, if these corporations are beginning to spend more of their ad revenue elsewhere, their reliance upon the American consumer is diminishing.  
  
Well, that's all I've got. Thanks for taking some time with me.
Cheers.

I am teaching Civics and Economics and am going to show the Michelle Obama speech.  To be fair and balanced I am looking for a quality speech from the RNC to showcase the Republican side.  I am preferably looking for someone who had a different audience than Michelle Obama, yet would be clear enough to 10th grade students.  I've only been watching the DNC and didn't catch the RNC.  I would really appreciate any help you could send me way.

















Let me preface this with the fact that I am a Democrat and I will most likely vote for Obama in this coming election.  That being said, I understand that many of facts I hear about the Republican Party are slanted by an incredibly liberal media.  I realized recently that I actually know very little about the Republican Platform and the political/economic/social views that accompany it.  I am not here to insult other peoples' view points, I simply want to learn about some views that (I assume) are different from my own.







I am reading Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman and was wondering what you guys thought of this statement he makes. "The use of government to overcome neighborhood effects itself has an extremely important neighborhood effect which is unrelated to the particular occasion for government action". Could someone explain?

Tell Exxon that collecting tax money from consumers and employees and giving it to the government does NOT count as paying a lot of taxes!










He has the resume, Ambassador to Singapore and China, ex Governor of Utah. I saw a small story on him a while back in the depths of CNN saying that people liked him. But since then the most I have heard is the quote of his that was on the front page. If he can somehow maneuver the crazies in the primaries I think he would give Obama a run for his money.



For those that don't know about history ... Here is a condensed version: 

  Humans originally existed as members of small bands of nomadic hunters/gatherers.They lived on deer in the mountains during the summer and would go to the coast and live on fish and lobster in the winter. 

  The two most important events in all of history were the invention of beer and the invention of the wheel. The wheel was invented to get man to the beer. These were the foundation of modern civilization and together were the catalyst for the splitting of humanity into two distinct subgroups:   

1 . Liberals  
2. Conservatives. 

  Once beer was discovered, it required grain and that was the beginning of agriculture. Neither the glass bottle nor aluminum can were invented yet, so while our early humans were sittingaround waiting for them to be invented, they just stayed close to the brewery. That's how villages were formed.   

Some men spent their days tracking and killing animals to BBQ at nightwhile they were drinking beer. This was the beginning of what is known as the Conservative movement...   

Other men who were weaker and less skilled at hunting learned to live off the conservatives by showing up for the nightly BBQ's and doing the sewing, fetching, and hair dressing. This was the beginning of the Liberal movement.  Some of these liberal men eventually evolved into women. They became known as girlie-men. 

Some note worthy liberal achievements include the domestication of cats, theinvention of group therapy, group hugs, and the concept of Democraticvoting to decide how to divide the meat and beer that conservatives  provided   

Over the years conservatives came to be symbolized by the largest, most powerful land animal on earth, the elephant. Liberals are symbolized by the jackass for obvious reasons.   

Modern liberals like imported beer (with lime added), but most prefer white wine or imported bottled water. They eat raw fish but like their beef well done. Sushi, tofu, and French food are standard liberal fare.. Another interesting evolutionary side note: most of their women have higher testosterone levels than their men. Most social workers, personal injury attorneys, journalists, dreamers inHollywood and group therapists are liberals. Liberals invented the designated hitter rule because it wasn't fair to make the pitcher also bat.  

Conservatives drink domestic beer, mostly Bud or Miller. They eat red meatand still provide for their women. Conservatives are big game hunters, rodeo cowboys, lumberjacks,construction workers, firemen, medical doctors, police officers,  engineers, corporate executives,  athletes, members of the military, airline pilots and generally anyone who works productively.   Conservatives who own companies hire other conservatives who want to work for a living.   

Liberals produce little or nothing. They like to govern the producers and decide what to do with the production. Liberals believe Europeans are more enlightened than Americans. That is why most of the liberals remained in Europe when conservatives were coming to America .. They crept in after the Wild West was tamed and created a business of trying to get more for nothing.
 
Here ends today's lesson in world history:
 
It should be noted that a Liberal may have a momentary urge to angrily respond to the above before forwarding it. 

 A Conservative will simply laugh and be so convinced of the absolute truth of this history that it will be forwarded immediately to other true believers and to more liberals just to piss them off.  

And there you have it. Let your next action reveal your true self.....I'm going to have another beer.



It is located at, you guessed it, [r/TimPawlenty](http://www.reddit.com/r/TimPawlenty/).


I'm not sure what the general pulse of r/republicans is regarding him, but for any of you who are interested, it is there.












Why do so many Republican's believe science is wrong?  I ask this question based on how the Republican leaders and candidates act toward science. 






How do you reconcile the fact that your party is anti-spending and the fact that your party supports a strong defense commitment--resulting in over a trillion dollars of spending in Iraq and Afghanistan to date, and billions more per year on military contracts?  

Do you, the average Republican, recognize this contradiction and disagree with the actions of your politicians?

Or is there some explanation that I and many other frustrated Americans have been unable to come up with yet?





What's your religion/lack of one?

The Iowa straw poles will be coming in August. Please support Ron Paul and tell everyone you know to support him as well. 

I don't work for Ron Paul but I am trying to support him. I would love the opportunity to persuade a fellow voter.

You are just bad people and you should be treated as such by the rest of us. 
A plane crashed in the rural mountains of Tennessee. Panic stricken, the local sheriff mobilized and descended on the farm in force. When they got there, the disaster was clear. 
  
The aircraft was totally destroyed with only a burned hulk left smoldering in a tree line that bordered a farm. The sheriff and his men entered the smoking mess but could find no remains of anyone. 
  
They spotted a lone farmer plowing a field not too far away as if nothing had happened. They hurried over to the man’s tractor. 
  
“Hank,” the sheriff yelled, panting and out of breath. “Did you see this terrible accident happen?” 
  
“Yep. Sure did.” the farmer mumble unconcernedly, cutting off the tractor’s engine. 
  
“Do you realize that is the airplane of the President of the United States ?” 
  
“Yep.” 
  
“Were there any survivors?” 
  
“Nope. They’s all kilt straight out,” the farmer answered. “I done buried them all myself. Took me most of the morning.” 
  
“President Obama is dead?” the sheriff shouted. 
  
"Well,” the farmer grumbled, restarting his tractor. “He kept a-saying he wasn’t …But you know how bad that sumabitch lies.” 





Last night I was playing chess and one of the older guys, who is a very staunch Republican who watches Fox all the time and listens to Rush, Glenn, etc and he was talking about the debt ceiling.  He claimed that the government will NOT run out of money on the 2nd and this was a completely blown out of proportion fake crisis in which the government will still be able to pay for everything without raising the debt ceiling.

Do you have any idea what he was talking about?  Again, he was NOT saying that the U.S. defaulting would be okay, he was saying we would NOT default at all without raising the debt ceiling.
And what I mean is we have an election coming up, one that IMO is critical because I do not want BO in office another term. The Republicans are shooting themselves in the foot if they continue to split within in the party. Thoughts?

I'm attempting to open a non-hostile dialogue so I can understand people's opinions.  Posting things like "fuck you" isn't helpful, and it certainly doesn't make me see the other side of the aisle any better.

R/liberaldouchebaggery










This upcoming week i will have a big project in school about school shootings and school massacres. And i was wondering if any of you guys would like to answer a couple of questions. There are only 9 of them and it will probably not take long.
If you are interested please pm me or write in the comments that you are interested.

Edit: i forgot some text.




The election is years away so real issues may arise in the comments. They may not as well.






Howdy rRepublicans, first time posting on this sub.

Me and my family are all Republicans, however I have really only become interested in politics in the last couple of years after graduating from college. 

My family are all big Trump and Cruz supporters, for lack of time I really have not been able to keep up with the debates and candidates as much as I would like, other than catching a little bit of Rush and Hannity. Is Trump really that popular and what are the odds of him getting the Republican nod?

I always thought it is was a word created by racists to call others who call them out for being racists. No one can bait anyone into being racist you are either a racist or not. 


It is a personal choice to be a racist. So you cannot call someone a race baiter because they speak up for a group being discriminated against. 
Assuming that no one changes their positions, if someone else got the nomination this election cycle and Donald Trump ran on a third party, would you vote for him?

If he doesn't have your undying support, are there any Republican candidates you'd vote for instead of him?



Rubio seems like a far more moderate candidate who can get the swing voters which will be needed to win the election so why is the GOP backing Cruz?  Is because he is young? Experience as a US politician does not a good leader make.

P.S. Why are all the Republican subreddits pretend to be synonymous with conservative?  It makes one wonder if people truly understand what it means to be republican...

&gt;[...]the Real Clear Politics average of polls in the Kentucky governor’s race had the Democrat, Jack Conway, ahead of the Republican, Matt Bevin, by five points.
Bevin won by nearly nine.
“It was 14 points off,” Reed marveled. “But everybody shrugs and moves on down the highway.”

&gt;[...] There are consequences, too. An obsession with polls and a quickness to weave narratives around them bolster certain candidates and retard others, and could well affect the outcome of this presidential election.
If Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination — or, heaven forbid, the White House — it will be partly because we in the media justified saturation coverage of him by pointing to polls, which in turn legitimized his fixation on them as proof that he’s up to the job: He must be, because plenty of people apparently picture him in it.

&gt;[...] Polls determined which Republican candidates participated in which debates, although just a couple of percentage points — the margin of error, really — separated a few of the prime-time debaters from the early birds.
Some of these polls were national ones, which have minimal relevance to the decisive, trajectory-setting contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
“A national poll is absolutely meaningless,” said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Romney’s 2012 campaign. “One of every nine Americans lives in California. So one of every nine voters in that poll is going to be in California. When’s the last time anybody read a story about the Republican primary in California?”

&gt;[...] Many, if not most, voters haven’t made up their minds. In last week’s CNN/WMUR poll of New Hampshire voters, for example, about one in three Republicans said that they had definitely decided on a candidate.

&gt;[...] People’s reliance on cellphones has complicated polling: Federal law forbids automated calls to such phones, so pollsters must bear the considerable expense of dialing them by hand or, alternately, make do without them, which can lead to imperfect results.

Trump has said in the past few days that he will be boycotting the debate because he does not believe it is fair for Megan Kelly to be a moderator on her own news station. I think it's time that Republicans take a hard look at exactly what Trump is doing. From the past few debates we have seen that his presence brings a lot less productivity to these debates and a lot of grade school trash talking. It is entertaining yes but his refusal to debate right before Iowa is a sign he wants to rig his numbers so he won't lose votes before the primaries. As Republicans it is important that we see through this thinly veiled political posturing and actually watch a debate with substance rather than a guy bragging while supporting an organization that [is not as beneficial to vets as it says it is](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/us/wounded-warrior-project-spends-lavishly-on-itself-ex-employees-say.html?_r=0&amp;referer=https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/42z6oc/wounded_warrior_project_spends_lavishly_on_itself/). Trump is showing weakness by cowering to Fox News. It is important to show that we as Republicans actually want to win the White House and get The debates numbers up to counter Trump's spiteful rally. He does not care about the party and having his rally fall short of Debate viewers will likely cause him a bruised ego as he constantly demands attention. The way to beat Trump is to take the spotlight off him and now we have a chance. For Trump supporters who are unswayed, enjoy your mental masterbation and conscious censorship of other candidates. Trump will lose a general election because he has built a wall or divisiveness against him.
Not trying to get anybody upset, just having a really hard time finding anything online about what this exactly means. I identify as an Independent and although I do learn left more often then I lean right, my ballots usually tend to be very mixed come Election Day.

I hear online a lot of stuff about Republicans claiming to be pro-life when they are really just pro-birth. What exactly do people mean by this, and from your perspective why are they wrong? Or are they right?

Thanks for any info!








Cuz there are a lot more in the other sub-reddit; this is about 1/4 the size. If you guys want to better organize yourselves to downvote/respond to/return-flame liberal posts, then you should prob combine into one (the combined total would be bigger than the dems sub-reddit). Just some friendly advice from a moderate. :)











Do any of them support stem cell research?







I would like this to be a scholarly discussion, and please provide evidence if you can, but it's fine if it isn't.   
My main concern is with the increasingly large influence of supply side economics as evidence for decreasing taxes on the upper and "higher end" class of our society. However, if the middle class and poor have no cash to spend, then demand becomes very low for American products that tend to have a pricier tag. So what's the point of lowering taxes on the rich and raising taxes on the poor?   
The upper class of our society is subsidized with tax reductions so they higher more people and provide jobs. However, if there's no demand for their business, then how will they higher people? If we lower taxes on the above 250k tax bracket, don't we also need to lower taxes across the spectrum for everybody? At least on, say, a flat tax level?

If President Obama's "Obamacare" fails within the next three months i seriously predict that he will not be in for another four years. The ACA plan has used about 1.4 billion dollars so far and the USA cannot keep that up for too much longer. If the ACA fails then is there any way that he would be re-elected? I certainly hope not. But what others things does he have to run off of? he is trying to run off the Obamacare once more because of the outcome of it before. I am just curious of what everyone thinks about this.
Who could Republicans mobilize or covert easiest?    What issues should be approached?

As a proud American and Republican constituent who doesn't understand our corporate interests in selling out of national labor force in lieu of unsustainable small term growth, I don't understand how our Republican representatives can be such fervent supporters of these vital economic exports. Could not both parties come together to enact an equal employment act that would require any business located within the United States to employ at least one U.S. Citizen for every foreign national that they employ? I don't see how this is anything but extremely pro American, unless jobs for Americans is somehow bad for them and jobs for non Americans is more important. Does anyone else agree or am I just incredibly naive? I know it reeks of affirmative action, but not on a race level but a national level. Shit, maybe I'm just thinking like a fucking socialist tonight after too many beers. 
TBH I didn't know what to think when I saw her so Just looked her up and down and walked on by but I did want to just start cringing on the floor. She was wearing a red dress and she had 3 personal body guards and she was surrounded by some enthusiastic people who were eagerly asking her questions. I had nothing to say to her because I don't think I would get any enlightened conversation out of her.
Basiccally put; I wouldn't vote for Michele Bachmann if the alternative was 1000 burning suns, that vile bitch is a whore.




I got tested for HIV at planned parenthood.  It was quick and easy.  Had I been HIV positive, I could have passed it on to someone like Bristol Palin.  The GOP has wanted to cut funding to Planned Parenthood.  Why do you want your children to die from AIDS when they grow up?

you are a democrat. If you are over 30 and have a brain, you are a republican.  :)



i'm prepared for the downvotes. Soo worth it. 


What about if we billed ex convicts after they got out of prison. For room, board cable, and EDUCATION, as well as full healthcare. A statistic I read said only 48% aren't repeat offenders, which means 1 of 2 things

1. 48% will pay back to the us if not all at least partially 

2. 52% will keep going back to jail and giving up more money in the long run

How can Bachmann be ahead of Ron? I just do not understand. Ron is just so logical and actually knows his stuff. How can he be losing to someone like Bachmann?






I'm attempting to open a non-hostile dialogue so I can understand people's opinions. Posting things like "fuck you" isn't helpful, and it certainly doesn't make me see the other side of the aisle any better. &lt;--- stole from another post.

What, in your opinion has President Obama done wrong in the last couple of years? What specific policies do you think he should have enacted that would have/will stimulate the economy and create jobs. 

Thanks!


DO you think Ron Paul is a viable candidate? Why or why not?
What do you think is the real reason the media is obviously blatantly ignoring him in every aspect?
to expand a bit, my parents are a nurse and a music teacher, neither of them with big salary. when I was sixteen I had a cancer (Hodgkin's lymphoma to be precise ) neither me nor my family had to paid for anything, It was completely paid by the state. I wasn't a brilliant student, but i go tu university to find something I'd like to study, after two years, I finaly discovered bioinformatics and was finally able to shine in a field I like. I'm now doing a Ph.D. as I said, I didn't pay more than 4500$ for my whole stay at the university (5 years, aprox 500 $ by years). actually as my parents where poor, I had a grant to pay the first years (I later had a grant because I was well graded). in the final year of my study, when the work was quite intense and I needed to have as much time as I could dedicated to work, I was granted an appartment to rent near my university at a real good price (wich is a rare commodity in paris).

I don't know if it's true but the classical image of america from outside lead me to believe I would be either dead, in debt (me or my family) or forced to don't go to university if I was born in the U.S.A.. is that true?

also I generally read that people oppose freedom and welfare, but I feel that having the choice to have a superior education without dependin on your family or indebting you is actualy more freedom than the oposite. being able to chose any work you like without having to worry about the health or education of your family is also a kind of freedom.

ps : I first posted this on /R/PoliticalDiscussion but was advised to come here for more interesting comments. I know that this can be seen as some atempt to trolling, but I'm really interested in viewpoint that diverge from what I'm use to.





A Presidential Candidate like Ron Paul seriously only runs once in a blue moon. Whoever has read or heard him knows he is not like other candidates. This is our one chance to vote for someone like this.
Specifically, I'm running for State representative next year. I will run in the republican primary, some of my friends asked me if I would run as an independent, but I realize I probably don't have a chance in hell if I can't win the primary.

I want to know how I can get more involved in party politics and get more exposure as a non candidate, not much is happening right now in my local county party, so I think that's why I haven't gotten any call backs about volunteering to help.

I've also looked for other conservative groups to help with, but have only found one that was concerned with textbooks and education reform, but they had a bunch of weird agenda stuff about gays and I decided to stay away from helping them.

Are there any national groups that may have an office local to me that might be willing to take me on as a volunteer? I'll take anything as long as it fits my old right, more libertarian views. I live in the Oklahoma City metro area.

Thanks Reddit!

I think that for our democracy to function, we must be properly represented in our government. The constitution states that there will be no more than 1 representative for every 30,000 Americans, so let's have them. Right now, there is a maximum of 435 people representing our population of 313,000,000+. I don't find that to be adequate. 

[Increase the number of representatives in the House of Representatives.](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/create-positions-house-representatives-such-there-1-every-30000-americans/FVgQnbTp)

I think that there is a large amount of corruption in our government because politicians view what they do as their job rather than as a service that they are providing for the American people. When we are living in an age where our government is breaking itself to cover the bills, why are we continuing to pay luxurious salaries to the people who are supposed to be representing our interests? How many waitresses wind up in congress? How many clerks? Where are the artists? Where are the musicians, the school teachers, the mechanics, the sanitation workers? Americans aren't a collective of lawyers and business people, and they shouldn't be represented by them. Working in congress should be an honor, not a career choice. 

[Set congressional term limits and reduce their pay to minimum wage.](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/impose-term-limits-members-congress-and-reduce-their-pay-minimum-wage/Xck40jBN)

These things might not be the perfect ideas or solutions. They may not fix everything. 

 I think that they're a good start. 
It's unrealistic and shows a lack of good faith.  Reading the fine print, it only funds the government through mid-Dec 2013.  That's two months.  Basically, the House Republicans are telling the President that they'll fund the government for two months in exchange for dismantling his trademark legislation.  Why is it a reasonable negotiating tactic to offer two months in exchange for what Obama sees as his legacy?  I think it shows a serious lack of leadership.



If 85% of the spending on obamacare is mandatory regardless of what the budget says, why are the republicans not using this fact against Obama and Reid in the press?

"While this budget only de-funds 15% of Obamacare, we feel that is an important first step toward our goal of full repeal. If the democrats would prefer to shut down the government over 15% - that is their choice."

Shouldn't this be the memo for every house republican?

If I'm not mistaken, more than 50% of the politicians we elect in the Republican party oppose legal marijuana, certainly at the Federal level. The majority of such representatives also self-identify as "pro-life." Oddly, they never seem to accomplish much with regards to that agenda but that is another discussion. What their representatives are quite good at in Congress, it seems, is making adults who provide cannabis to other adults to go to prison. They are very good at this agenda. For decades they have made and enforced harsh laws and even lifetime prison sentences for adults who provide cannabis to other adults, and they even banned clinical trials with the plant for decades. The researchers and even the providers themselves very often help sick people heal themselves with the simple, cheap plant God made. Sometimes they accidentally help hipsters enjoy concerts, but other than that, they are usually good people who pay taxes, take care of their kids, give to charity, etc. The plant is 10,000,000 times less dangerous than alchohol, mind you. It has never killed a soul, but it has healed many. So what I'm wondering is this...

If this party calls itself pro-life, then shouldn't it also call itself pro-sickness? It seems to accomplish much more with regards to keeping medicine illegal than it does protecting life. More importantly though, isn't it kind of deceptive to call myself pro-life with regards to another woman's reproductive organs if our party is pro-death when it comes to her older children who are dying of illnesses that legal cannabis would heal and relieve?

Perhaps instead of self-identifying with our party's feelings toward what we judge to be others' sins, maybe we should start self-identifying with our party's feelings toward our unquestionably living, breathing, suffering neighbors in need. Just a question...

People have been noticing that this anti-Trump video is losing its dislikes. I, myself, have been watching since 4:00pm CST, even recorded it for about 15 minutes, and have seen the count drop from 11,560+ dislikes to the current 7:40pm CST dislike count of 11,385. Did anyone even know that the YouTube like/dislike count could be altered after-the-fact? Would this not undermine YouTube's (and owner Google's) credibility with potential advertisers, if such a thing were possible? People also claim that some negative comments have disappeared, although all of mine still seem to be there. I have no problem with sane discourse on issues, but I do have a problem with using children to spout profanities and abusing and altering social media results in an attempt to affect public opinion.

I don't normally post to Reddit, so I apologize if I'm posting this incorrectly at all. I'm just trying to get the word out wherever I can.

Hello /r/Republican, I'm trying to decide who to vote for in the 2016 election. However, a lot of what I think I know about the candidates is just heresay from my very biased peers and superiors (on both the left and the right). What I'm looking for are some reliable sources on which I can look through the current candidates platforms and policies for their presidential campaign **with no comments on the quality of those platforms.** I just want to know the facts of what each candidate on both sides want to pursue, nothing else. The quality and efficacy of their plans is something I want to decide upon myself after some research.

In my posts and searchings all around Reddit, I've only heard liberal/communist/Anti-American ideals. Can someone clarify why for me? Please.







I'm not here to troll I just wanted some honest answers because Michigan Representative, Justin Amash, recently said "The public is not behind us, and that's a real problem for our party."
Young Americans between the ages of 18-29 overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage and favor allowing illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.  9 in 10 Americans favor criminal background checks for gun buyers and only 12% of Americans believe global warming is a hoax.  
What can the Republican Party do regarding these issues?  Would they have to change their stance if they want to get more young Americans involved?

The name Forward carries a special meaning in socialist political terminology. It has been frequently used as a name for socialist, communist and other leftwing newspapers and publications, denoting an urge for progress. Vorwärts! (German for 'Forward', with an exclamation point as part of the name) was a revolutionary German emigré publication issued in Paris in the mid-1840s. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were amongst the contributors to the magazine. Whilst the publication was short-lived, it had a lasting impact and served as an inspiration for later socialist press outlets. A second Vorwärts (without exclamation point) was founded in 1876, being an organ of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and with Wilhelm Liebknecht as its first editor. In the years before the First World War, the term 'vorwärts' was almost monopolized in German political discourse by the Social Democrats, and the name was used for various publications and organizations.

The German Vorwärts inspired socialists around the world. The Yiddish daily Forverts, founded in New York in 1897, was named after the German publications (which were well-known amongst Jewish radical circles at the time). Rather than using the Yiddish word faroys, a transliteration of the German name was used. Another prominent example has been Vpered (Russian language for 'Forward'), the publication that Lenin started after having resigned from the Iskra editorial board in 1905 after a clash with Georgi Plekhanov and the Mensheviks. The name did however fall out of fashion in Russia after the October Revolution. A Volga German Bolshevik newspaper named Vorwärts was re-baptized Nachrichten as the Soviet leadership wished to avoid associations with the German Social Democratic organ.

"FORWARD" is the new slogan of Barack Obama's re-election campaign for President of the United States.

tl;dr Our esteemed President's new campaign slogan has SERIOUS ties to communist and socialist groups of the last century. Somehow I'm not surprised.








I always wonder...How many people on here are paid political activists?

I'm writing this as a conservative, some might say fundamentalist, Christian who was fully prepared to put aside some of the more foolish things Santorum had to say because I felt he supported the same policies I became a Republican for in the first place. 

Now I'm left to choose between Obama who, to his credit, has shown good sense in managing the wars (ie promoting top generals, withdrawing from Iraq), successfully shuffled Panneta and Petraeus into his Cabinet, Osama is dead, and he plays foreign leaders like a fiddle. In other words, on defense and foreign affairs, where in 2008 I was extremely skepticle, he's come out at with @ least a B on his report card (in my opinion). Romney is now the untested one I have to wonder as to how he'd perform in that regard.

I also have to wonder how he'd do socio-economically, being the former Governor of Massachusets. Being Red in a Blue State isn't exactly the same as being Red in *my* state. He *talks* more conservative than his actions when he was in office, but its *talk*. 

As we draw nearer to the election I'm faced with having to choose between the Democrat who @ least I now know isn't going to be the worst president ever, and Romney who doesn't seem to be all that idealogically different and I've got no way of verifying his presidentialness.

Any input would be appreciated.







Dear republicans of reddit

I was hoping I could ask you guys a simple question.  I'm not looking to start an argument of any sorts (though a calm debate is always welcome) but I just have an honest question about a conservative/republican position.  

When Republicans (Romney comes readily to mind) say that "Corporations are people" what does this really mean?  I feel that no one truly believes a corporation could be a "person," but obviously people passionately disagree.  Can someone please elaborate/explain this to me?

I live in a small city in southern Louisiana. There is a person, let's call him Smith, who does not live in my city, but tries as hard as he can to control media and politics in my city. He runs a tabloid-like newspaper that was the only source of local media in the city for years. There is now a legitimate newspaper that is doing its best to spread the truth, but it's a slow and painful process.

Smith has some connections and he knows how to work the system. He defames legitimate candidates and puts his own footmen on a pedestal for election (and has recently gotten some success, unfortunately). Yes, that's politics, I get that. So he's kind of a scumbag guy who has unfortunate connections and a very shady background, only in it to manipulate a small town of nice, relatively politically naive, people.

**THE QUESTION:**

Now he has created, apparently all by himself, a "Republican Municipal Executive Committee" to represent our city (in which he does not even reside). I don't understand it. **What does it do? How is it made?** How did he make one without *anyone* in the city knowing about it? Is that even allowed? What is its purpose? They are being sworn in at a Metro Council meeting in the neighboring, much larger city. Why? He appointed a bunch of friends to the committee. How? If they're being "sworn in," wouldn't that suggest someone *voted* for them? Who did? There was no public vote! If this is not legitimate, who do I go to to bring this to light?

Any information would be awesome. I am new to political activism, and I'm still learning the ropes. If you have some source that explains it, I don't mind doing the reading.

**EDIT:** Talked to some people smarter than me. It's essential a meaningless power play. This is not even a legitimate thing. Ugh.

1.

Don't try to out-liberal the liberals. You don't have to be diverse, diversity is a liberal selling point. There's no shame in being a political party that mostly represents white people. At least 72% of Americans are white, and whites are more likely to show up at the ballet box. Supporting amnesty for illegal aliens means preparing your own demise, as they will vote for Democrats. 

If it's necessary for you to expand your electorate, don't focus on Hispanics, focus on educated people and women instead.

2.

The confrontational style of American politics means that liberals will support anything that makes it easier for them to win elections, even when it harms the democratic process. That's why they want felons to vote, as well as people without ID. In Britain and the Netherlands felons are not allowed to vote either. Similarly, in the Netherlands a form of ID is required to vote. Nobody here even considers it an issue, nor should you. We need people to vote who think carefully before making their decision.

Liberals are vulnerable to feelings of shame and guilt. Point out to them that in any other Western country a political party would be too embarrassed to support rule changes that make it easier for criminals to vote for them.

3.

Stop trying to restrict abortion. A fetus doesn't suffer, the animals you eat suffer. Healthy societies are societies where children are born to parents capable of taking care of them. 

4.

Don't try to get rid of foreign aid. Foreign aid is a cheap way of accomplishing what you now accomplish through expensive wars. Societies succumb to violence when they have more people than they can provide for. The easiest way to avoid further wars is providing women with contraceptives and abortion. 

[Mexican immigration to the United States is now rapidly going down, because of low Mexican birth rates.](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/26/opinion/passel-cohn-mexican-immigration/index.html) Imagine what would have happened without Reagan's [Mexico City Policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Policy)! You would have had fewer illegal immigrants.

I'm sure not every Republican holds this view but it seems like the overwhelming majority of Republicans, conservatives, right-wingers, what-have-you claim that Obama screwed up our country.  How?  What exactly do you take issue with?  In the interest of full disclosure, I'm an independent but a very left-leaning independent.  This isn't a baiting question and I'm not asking it just to start an argument.  I'm genuinely curious about what your arguments against his policies are.

You wake up and praise Hillary Clinton.    

You look outside and see the illegal immigrants burning you neighbors house down and tipping over your car. Not again.    

You break a branch off from a nearby tree to protect yourself as you get the mail. You wish you had a gun, but they have been made illegal by a liberal Supreme Court. 

You make it back home with a few scratches and open the first envelope. Oh shit, it's tax day.    

You can't afford it. All the jobs left for China and Mexico. You hear a helicopter coming towards your house. It's Hillary.   

You tidy up the hut known as your house and get ready. Out of the helicopter pops out 2 illegal immigrants working as security and and old woman in a wheelchair that looks at least 130 years old. You kneel to her.
    

"Do you have the money?" She asks. "N-no mam" you reply. She says something in spanish and you brains are immediately blown out.  He flies away and black lives matter sell your body parts for money to pay off taxes.    

Veterans programs are cut in order to pay for illegal immigrants and refugees.

Occupy Democrats is using a Photoshopped picture of Eric Trump, created a redditor for a contest on r/photoshopbattles. They're using it unsourced, and under false pretenses as political propaganda. This needs to be stopped. Spread the word. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1130820987010954&amp;substory_index=0&amp;id=346937065399354

This is from the bible, the very words of Jesus (Mathew 25):

41 Then He will say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

42 For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink,

43 I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’

44 And they too will reply, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’

45 Then the King will answer, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.’

46 And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

Shouldn't this influence the way you vote as to welfare, health care, the prison system and immigrants?

For the sake of this conversation, can you post one sentence, as a top level comment, that encapsulates a specific negative aspect of the Obama presidency? Longer explanations and conversation welcome below top comments.

THANKS!

As a young child my parents didn't discuss too much about politics, we are Mexican blooded. But as for me... It doesn't matter, I am an American. When I was in my early teens I dabbled with socialism and the democratic party. But my fascination with studying history and political philosophy led me to become a conservative. I am currently writing a book in Spanish to help Spanish speaking peoples become Republicans. As somebody who has been to northern Mexico, I also want to tell you something... keep that shit away from here. I doubt any of you have seen a Machete hacked body laying in the middle of the street with paint on it. I doubt any of you have seen a "Poso" Meaning hole in the ground where dead bodies have been thrown. I doubt any of you have seen Marines roaming the streets in an attempt to bring peace to a little town on the border. Mexico is not a pretty place, as a Mexican who spent the first 8 years of his life in Mexico... we need to try our best to keep that from spilling over. It's nothing race related, but it's the common duty of a government to protect its border when it's in the best interest of its people. Long live this Republic.

The C-SPAN "Voters First" Republican Forum doesn't seem to be a sanctioned debate, yet 14 of the candidates are participating, apparently not worried that it would impact their participation in RNC-sanctioned debates. How is this possible? Is this a semantics issue, where they're getting away with it by not calling it a debate, or are candidates taking the approach of "they can't ban all of us"?































Sorry, long post but there is much info to cover..

When looking at some of our largest immigration “overhauls” in recent history, they tend to lean where they can offer the most political gain domestically. The largest of these actions, DACA, or the “Dream Act,” is perhaps the farthest reaching of all immigration related programs in recent history. Unfortunately, its polices tend to strongly favor one group over others.

Lets take a look at "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" (DACA) statistics:

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service has a broad definition of what DACA (otherwise known as the “dream act”) is, but basically it’s a three-year protection against deportation (passed by executive action) for those who reside in the country illegally and meeting the following criteria.

	•	Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012
	•	Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday
	•	Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time
	•	Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making your request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS
	•	Had no lawful status on June 15, 2012, meaning that you never had a lawful immigration status on or before June 15, 2012, or Any lawful immigration status or parole that you obtained prior to June 15, 2012, had expired as of June 15, 2012
	•	Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States
	•	Have not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.


This problem with DACA is, for starters, that the program is one sided. To be eligible, you have to enter in to the country illegally first. Then you have to have children or be a child yourself. Statiscally speaking, both of these criteria are much more likely to occur among hispanic immigrants.

In other words, this is a de-facto amnesty for nearly half of Mexican  immigrants while its impact is much less significant on its Asian, African, or European counterparts.

Our society demands diversity everywhere but in immigration.

Don't believe me?

Here is the percentage of recipients-                                          

                  -Europe 2%
                  -South America 7%
                  -Asia 8%
                  -Other North &amp; Central America 13%
                  -Mexico 68%
                  -Other Regions 2%

Its statistics like these that show the true inequality in government policy. Why would our government allow this? because 7 our of 8 first and second generation Hispanic immigrants polled choose to "self identify as democrats". That being said, I don't have an issue with anyone of any nationality immigrating here, but it has to be proportional to other nationalities.

This just skimmed the surface and their is more "nut ands bolts" info about our policy here:

What do you think?






















I'm not necessarily a regular contributer to freerepublic.com, but you'll usually find me arguing on the other side when someone posts a Bernie Sanders plug or something I consider economically ignorant. Also, I'm registered Republican and plan to vote in the primaries.

...basically I'm just trying to preface that I'm not trolling, I want to have a legit conversation about this.

I try to understand the appeal of certain candidates, particularly ones doing well in the polls, and I have a very hard time. Instead of seeing a poll; a reflection of crowd mentality, I would like to hear some individual thoughts on these candidates, if you like them, and why you think they would be a good President.

Ben Carson: He's a neurosurgeon and a likeable guy, OK. But President? To me, it's a fallacy of 'smartness' that we, say, ask a Physicist for their opinion about Art, figuring expertise translates from one field to another. But a nobel physicist may not know a damn thing about art. Putting thousands of hours into mastering neurosurgery doesn't even make you an expert in another kind of surgery, let alone in economics or public policy. So, surgeon, might want to have a beer with him (does anyone honestly use that standard to judge a Presidential candidate?), but beyond that? The things he has said politically have been pretty out there to me, or simply factually incorrect. Do you think Democrats might be more likely to vote for him because he's black and academically smart in a field? Not a chance, they hate him. So what's the appeal?

Scott Walker: Admittedly I don't know a huge bit about him. I remember he almost got impeached in his fight with teachers unions, next thing I know he's one of the top choices for the nomination. I listen to what he says, and am unimpressed. Yet his numbers are still big, so why?

Donald Trump: Yeah...this is obviously the big one. He's fun to have around I suppose, but beyond that? This is one of those "I might have to leave the country if this actually happens" picks. It's scary. Do you think his immigration plan is actually legit? (To me, it's weird to have even picked up immigration as a big deal at all this election cycle.) Are we just so looking for a Washington outsider that even he will do? I know there are other Republicans who share the sentiment, but yet there are still 1/4 of us who make him top choice for the nomination, so if you're one of those, I would love to hear your reasoning.










Do you think the USA would eventually benefit from something like this? Why or why not?

Come, come all! Marvel at what is taking place before your very eyes!

Myself and /u/TotallyNotAPanda are proud to announce the (re)establishment of the Progressive Democrats. The Progressive Democrats believe in pragmatism, personal responsibility and clear financial planning. We have compiled our views on various aspects of Government policy here

Myself and /u/TotallyNotAPanda decided to form the Progressive Democrats because we found ourselves a bit too liberal to call ourselves Conservatives yet too financially conservative to call ourselves Liberal Democrats.

We don't believe in nanny state-ism. We believe in personal responsibility. The Government has a role in our lives, but that role isn't that of an angry parent grounding you from xbox for a week. The government's role is to ensure that people are free to live their lives freely!

Every party needs an ideology and every party has to have beliefs. However, both of these must transfer into real world application. The Progressive Democrats will advocate for pragmatic policies based on the reality we live in, not the reality in which we wish to be.

How the government spends the money it gets should be of the utmost importance to any political party. The Progressive Democrats stand for sensible governance. Spend money where it needs to be spent, cut taxes where they need to be cut and institute programs that need to be instituted. The Progressive Democrats want you to get the best value for every cent that comes out of your pocket.

The Progressive Democrats stand for 'Free Markets, Free Trade, Free People.'

I'm honestly not here to judge or argue. I'm genuinely curious.

From my perspective, the party has become a sideshow act that hurts America in the name of greed and religion. I live in a pretty liberal bubble and don't know many Republicans, so it's hard for me to fathom how this party appeals to voters.

So Republican of Reddit: Why do you vote Republican? I'm not here to argue. I may have further questions, but I'm really here to just get an understanding of how the other side thinks.

I'm definitely a republican but find myself moderate to liberal on a lot of issues so I'm not just complaining to pitchfork Hillary.  I am absolutely shocked that everyone said she won the debate and I can't see how, plus she pulled the 'first woman president' card to a roaring applause like being a woman, man, black, white, or whatever has anything to do with being a good leader.

If you guessed none, you're right! Now how many will fine you for smoking in public or in your car?

Came over exceptionally well. He was coherent, intelligent, moderate and positive. I don't have a link but Im sure one will turn up but I think it's one you should look out for.


Many Repubs like Donald because he won't accept campaign donations and his "no nonsense" approach.  I like that too.  However, I'm pushing for Bernie because he refuses to have a SuperPac and the vast amount of money for his campaign is coming from individuals and unions, his willingness to fight big money in politics, and because I share his liberal ideologies.  

I also know that some of you like the comments Donald made about Mexicans.  While I don't agree with that, please know that Bernie has said that he thinks that babies born in the U.S. by non-citizens should not get automatic citizenship.  So, there's that.

So, anyway, I know that this info won't change everyone's endorsement, I do hope that some of you will consider it and read more about him.  I don't trust CNN and I don't trust Fox News.  Therefore, please read up on the non-bias facts and remember to always "follow the money".

By the way, Bernie is more popular amongst Democrats than Hillary, but Time Warner and their subsidiary, CNN is trying to make Hillary look like dems' preferred choice.  They're trying to screw him like what happened to Ron Paul, who seemed like a good guy.

Thanks for reading.

Hi, I'm trying to understand what is compelling about the current crop of Republican/conservative candidates. I'd like to get away from the tidbits that are being shared by the people on the Democrat/liberal side and find out exactly what speeches, interviews, or conversations show your candidates in their best light. I'm not here to knock down or insult anyone but I do want to learn what gets you excited about the candidate and hear it for myself. Thank you. :)

I noticed that quite a lot of banter is happening on Republican debates, and the candidates don't focus their energy on content and substance. They rather degrade one another, and other countries, and also (recently) pointing blame at the media. Although many questions are answered (in my opinion, not sufficiently so), I fear that the Democrats might win with no worthy opponent... Just my thoughts... maybe I'm crazy. 









[deleted]


























Last night Hannity teased something about a fundraising scandal about to break in the Obama campaign, then I flip to MSNBC (I am a sadist apparently) and I saw a new ad with the MSNBC logo on it, with some famous black actor (don't know who) calling fraud a "boogeyman", saying do not be scared of this "boogeyman"... wtf??




















Seems to me, to almost everyone really, that last night Romney's foreign policy was "we would do everything Obama did but sooner and better". I am not exactly sure how that works, but that is a different issue. Is that the foreign policy that Republicans supporters like?








I'm fairly new to reddit and this will be my first time voting (I'm 20) and I had a few questions. 

People that are voting for Obama are voting for him because he believes everyone deserves a fair chance, but don't we get a fair chance to make something of ourselves every day? I know people with disabilities don't have exactly the same opportunity but I'm legally blind and I can't justify taking government assistance like food stamps and welfare just because I can't drive and live a somewhat normal life. 

Reddit is essentially a business because (im assuming) every time we visit the site someone makes money. The creator(s) of reddit decided to start a website and look how successful it is. Obama stated that small business owners didn't create their business themselves. Yes we didn't create the roads we use to drive on to get there but neither did he. 

Am I missing something? I feel that people who are going to vote for Obama are doing so because they believe health care, free money, free food, and unemployment are owed to them in a way. 

I'm not sure if I feel this way because my mother religiously watches Fox News or if its just something I've noticed about everyone I know who is going to vote for Obama. 

If I'm wrong please explain it to me. I want to be properly informed before I vote. 

I want to hear all reasons why i should believe a vote for Romney is not a vote for the same policies which produced the same economic situation we find ourselves in at the present.

I am a Ron Paul supporter. I think he has the best chance to pull liberals who are dissatisfied with Obama. I love his constitutional stance on the issues.



I watched the debate last night and I thought that Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul did the best.  They were the ones that actually gave good answers to the questions.  Actually Ron Paul had to change his questions so that he could get a decent answer out.  Michelle Bauchman seemed to just say the things that would get applause and it was a disgrace.















I listen to Erick Erickson on 95.5 wsb talk in Atlanta.  I got through to his show yesterday and asked him his opinion on the bill proposed by Ron Paul and Barney Frank to legalize marijuana at the federal level.  He laughed and hung up on me. Then he said he wasnt even going to comment on a bill proposed by Paul or Frank and went on to another caller who wanted to talk about violent video games.  He is afraid to mention Ron Paul let alone talk about a bi partisan bill that would limit federal government. His show airs monday through friday 7pm-10pm I would like to request as many people as possible to call and ask him about Ron Paul as a candidate and the Paul-Frank bill the phone number is 1-800-wsb-talk

1. Understand that both sides profit from their ability to influence you. 

2. Those wanting to influence you craft narratives and spin events to keep you believing you are in a crisis. People band together in the face of a threat and shared dangers bring communities closer.  Making them easier to  to control.

3. Understand that few people do anything maliciously. If you are being led to believe  your political opponents are evil you are not getting the whole picture.

4. Look deeply at the platform of your political opponents and pick at least three of their positions to actively support. It's not enough to just not resist those positions you need to actively buck those that you agree with on other issues.  This lessens the control the parties have on your attitudes and frees our democracy from  control by the few. Be granular with your support. Weigh each issue on its own merits. The parties platforms are built of different positions on unrelated topics. If you find that your opinions agree consistently with one side over the other then you are probably too accepting of the narrative you are being fed.

5. People tend to agree with those around them. If the groups you encounter are entirely from one side, consider joining groups and hobbies typically from the other side. Join a gun club or an environmental group. Since political opinions trend based on your population density visit areas where different from where you live. Go to the city, or go to the country. The subcultures you'll find are full of new attitudes, customs and cuisines. 

Remember the only values the parties consistently hold are that the other party should not be in control. With any luck we can lessen the parties influence and return contro to the individual.

As of a month ago it was started, but I did not do as much as I should of done to ensure it's growth. So from now on I will tend to this subreddit. The reason I made this was to place empahasis on discussion and chatter about the Republican party politics and history similar to r/politicaldiscussion by Republicans. The sane oppisite of r/politics. I feel this essential to the hidden and untaped potential Republican base of reddit and to spur the community here. A post will be written immediately.

It's still a long three years till touch down. Don't get cocky.
[deleted]
You can peak too soon and get stupid too quick. Happens all the time in sports.
"Judas" has arrived.

Like the 8 C-SPAN promises, run every video of him saying that taxes will not rise for people who make under $250,00 a year over and over.
I admit it, everytime I see "President Barack Obama" in my head I think it says "President Black Obama" then I have to pause and say wait... what?
Are there really enough people out there thinking along these lines for us to ponder, "What if?"
this is just fucking golden.
Ransom, anybody??
America to reject learning altogether.  Morphs into island of heavily armed preachers.
&gt;&gt;"They believe big government, big business, big media and the affluent professionals are merging to form self-serving oligarchy — with bloated government, unsustainable deficits, high taxes and intrusive regulation."


That said it all right there.


But he says it as if it isn't true...

A majority of Redditors and the left in general (much the same thing)seem to be spending all their collective time trying to find the fringe idiots to point a finger at, to belittle the tea party "movement", the guy with the racist sign, the woman who can't spell, the teenager who can't put a coherant thought together.  The problem with that is the rest of the country is listening to the ideas and not the bullshit. They know you're pulling a fast one.  They KNOW you are singling out the bad apples. It makes you look small... and scared.


So go ahead reddit, keep ridiculing Palin, her kids, her family, her State, keep making fun of the tea party, we'll see how that all works out for you.

I think perhaps as good as it worked for the Republicans in '08



My question to the left is this...

Now that we have "Health Reform" if the republicans do take control again in the next few years, what platform are you going to try to get the power back on?  It certainly can't be "Health Care reform"

You guys blew it, we could have had universal health care.. now we are stuck with only half measures and the insurance companies get 50 million new subscibers. People will remember that as a failure.


For the record, although I know many of you have the attention span of a gnat, I'll say right here that although I am a conservative, I will do my best to make sure Palin is NOT elected, even going so far as to vote for Obama. I am also an atheist.
Because when Republicans get it, they earned it.  When someone else gets it, it's an entitlement.  
When are they going to get to the jobs bill again?  They ran on jobs and cutting spending.  Since getting there they've worked on everything except those things.  
&gt;If these unions’ powers were to be restricted, it will lead to more determined employees who would gladly trade the larger wages of private sector work in favor of serving the community. Also, the quality of services would be greatly improved because the workers would gladly come in every day to a job they love, and would perform better than a person who was just there for the money.

So they'll work harder if we pay them less and give them fewer benefits. Seriously? You wouldn't apply this logic in the private sector, where anyone would tell you that larger salaries/better benefits attract better-qualified employees.
democrats are stupid

This guy waited till Obama showed up in Rio, wrote a check so they can produce oil and only sell to China. Then he did what Islam teaches! I mean who could do a better job then Obama? Anyone? If this is the best that America has to offer, us bottom feeders are fucked!
Wow.  This comment is like saying "I don't like vegetables" after being asked, "Would you like a hamburger or a hot dog."
i'm just trying to farm up votes, you republicans like to think on your toes more than the democrats.
Michael Savage is a draft dodging, anti-gay closet-gay fool.  He would not know the truth if it smacked him in the face.  I want to vomit when I hear him talk about how he loves his country, but he ran from Vietnam as fast as he could.
Love the fact he is attempting to blast "egghead academics" (in ALL CAPS SO YOU KNOW HE'S SERIOUS) whilst he himself;
&gt;Dr. Savage holds a master's degree in medical botany and a second in medical anthropology. Additionally, he earned his PhD. from the University of California at Berkeley in epidemiology and nutrition sciences.

Neither, honestly. Both of them are incredibly stupid.  
he nailed it, that is what makes you puke. he told you the truth.
The man is a liar and draft dodger, I could not care less about his political position.  I don't care about whether he told the truth or not in this case.  He hates the left because he felt rejected by them.  He has no real political views, only this mythical feeling of being slighted by people and spending every waking hour hating them.  He is the embodiment of the jilted lover, but my main issue is his lying and draft dodging.  And the article is full of gross inaccuracies, assumptions and typical conspiracy theory lies.  Do you know why he is clasified as a person with fringe beliefs?  because he rejects commone sense and facts in lieu of anger some odd sense of revenge.
So you hate Bill Clinton? Draft Dodger right? 
When was the last time you tuned into his show? Spews political views for 3 hrs a night!

Liberalism is a mental disorder! 
Yes, I always crush Clinton for running away!  The little difference is Clinton does not spend time advocating war and crushing other draft dodgers while doing the same.  He is a coward in the first order.  His does not have political views, he rails against people he does not like or people he thinks somehow wronged him, then turns that into "political views"  He fucking idolized Allen Ginsberg!!  He felt rejected by this magical left elitism he sees and rails against it.  Come on, think for yourself.
As if there is reason for Republicans to lose the budget debate.. Seriously? It's common sense that cutting extraneous government spending in this economic climate is essential. 
I am thinking for myself. I want to bring back the draft till these wars end. I think you hate the message. You hate the message that Obama didn't close Gitmo. You hate the fact the Obama didn't stop the war but expanded it. You hate the fact that Obama told you that under his admin. that energy prices would skyrocket. Well that time is here! Spread the wealth.. spread it to whom? Whose wealth are we spreading? We can't pass a budget, but we write checks in Rio our asses can't back up. They get to produce oil and their only Client is China! That is a great deal!

Back in the day, when all these countries that are in OPEC were vast waste lands of desert and didn't have a damn nickle to their name, how did they afford to produce oil? BTW OPEC IS controlled by Iran this round. So we are letting the likes of Iran determine the price and how much is produced? WTF!? Yes America, England and France made deals with the devil to produce their oil, use up their oil... as long as they would use profits to buy our debt. Well honey, they stopped buying our debt. The other part of the deal was we wouldn't produce nomore than 13-20% so now is the time to produce here and build more refineries. On the other hand, it could never hurt to spend money on green energy till we get all of our kinks out of it. Could always make building codes at the STATE levels to change building codes, lean towards geothermal. 

It's alright ptsaq, you're not mad at me! YOU'RE MAD AT YOUR FATHER!
Haha!  Lets start from the beginning. I am in favor of compulsory draft in peace and war time for ALL  citizens regardless of education status, no deferments.  I don't care about Gitmo one way or the other.  What is the next best solution if we close Gitmo. there is none.  I want the war in Aghan. to expand we should completely take over the country and set up a gov't like Japan post WWII.  I do hate the skyrocketing energy prices but you cannot blame that solely on the POTUS, G.W.B. or Obama.  Our oil policy is screwed up and has been so and will continue to be so until we get off of oil or at least foreign oil.  If we get off of OPEC, which we should, we would eliminate many of our problems.  We share some of the same views, I just started from a blank canvas and got to them by thinking,  instead of listening to "the leader" for what to think and say.  I don't dislike Savage because I do not agree him, which I usually don't, I don't like him because he is not a patriot, he does not care about this country.  He cares about what this country can do for him, he is a parasite and always has been.  He uses this country to push his agenda.  By the way, Honey, Im a guy...  I don't really understand the father and honey comment, I guess you assume Im a woman?  I don't know how you gleaned some depressed anger towards my father because I don't like Michael Savage, but YOU somehow did, wow.
&gt; I do hate the skyrocketing energy prices but you cannot blame that solely on the POTUS, G.W.B. or Obama

Yes you can. Obama told you his energy policy would make energy prices skyrocket. We are here! He should be molesting ANWAR Oil Reserves. He should be rubber stamping permits for the Gulf of Mexico. I think there is only like 7 compaines that are on the Bakken Oil Field with a very few sites being produced.

Now back to Savage. Find him on the radio tonight, tune in. Then tell me what his agenda is. Then tell me how he is to move forward with his agenda since he doesn't hold office. It's a entertainment/talking head show. He has good points and some I disagree with. I also tune into Alan Colmes at night. Gotta take the good with the bad. His show last night was about POT. Great. Savage spoke about the illegals, oneway to deal with that problem. How to recoup our money for the war in Iraq and Afghan. Then I tune into Colmes right, it went to POT. Then Alan bitched about birthers for an hour. Savage has substance, you might not like all of it but his show beats the hell out of Alan's. 

The father reference was a line from Big Daddy, honey. The honey part is lingo that stuck with me since I left the Army, sweet tits. :P
His agenda is anti-gay, anti-immigrant, anti-American.  His show of patriotism is such BS.  He only cares about exploiting, phony patriotism like most political talking heads.  I have listened to Savage many times along with several others, left and right.  They all have an agenda, people bitch about the "liberal media", none of the media is unbiased.  Savage, Colmes, Rush all those guys skew facts, leave out opposite arguments or flat ignore the truth for ratings, money and ego.  Olbermann was the worst though.  If I had to classify myself political beliefs I would say a liberal libertarian, mainly because the right is based on religion and has nothing to do with the Constitution or law.  The political right is sold itself to Christian fundam. decades ago.   They lost my vote.   I believe in gov't action when necessary where possible.  the problem is the left believes gov't is always the answer, bankrupting the country while the right believes gov't is never the answer, destroying the country.  Gov't exists for a reason, it is not supposed to be asleep until the walls come tumbling down.  The truth  always somewhere in the middle. The truth is never simple enough for a talk radio shock jock, which they all are, to explain without boring his audience to death and having his show canceled.  The difference between those guys and Nancy Grace is minimal.  
How would you classify reddit? There are some fucking nutty people on here. A sane person knows illegal immigration is kicking this country in the nuts. My great grandparents came here. The right way. It's just not about crossing a invisible line. It's about learning English, reading,writing and vaccines. You learn to read and write English by studying the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. When they passed the test they felt they have done something. Unlike illegals that bring crime to our streets cause they have become the new slaves that also have roaming rights to teach how TX to Cali will become part of Mexico once again. I spent a few years in TX, in south TX they are already flying the Mexican Flag at the court houses. 

My wife and I are both Vets. We also have anti gay issues. They were already in the ranks. Now we just have to hear about their gay ass weekends. The troops really don't need that distraction. Also people that say this isn't special rights for the gays is wrong. To be a couple and live in base housing you have to be married. Now what am I going to do when the gays start complaining about how they can't live in base housing with their life partner? Now I have to teach my young kids why the two men next door is kissing. His life partners wants his benefits now. ON and ON and ON. 

Nancy Grace looks like she ate her twins. She is getting sued for 15m btw.
I saw, she is going to hell.  Thank god, she is horrible.  reddit is generally way left, to many bumper sticker statements with no research behind it.  I'm torn on the illegal immigration issue.  On one hand you cannot deny the danger or problem it poses on the other I look at it what this country stands for, give me you're tired your hungry your poor yearning to be free.  I know we have a shitty economy, the middle class is shrinking etc. but immigration is a cornerstone of our country.  Lets remember the idea of "illegal" immigration was non existent for the first hundred years or or so of this country.  The problem seems to be that when your family came here, mine as well, they WANTED to assimilate into American society.  Many of the illegals now do not, they want to make money to send back home, they are looking for the "American dream", but not to become part of it.  if these illegals were looking for a way to citizenship I don't think the issue of their illegal entry would be nearly as big as it is.  As far as gay in the military, I take Barry Goldwater's viewpoint.  "I don't care if they are straight, I only care if they can shoot straight."  I see your point, of where does it end, first marriages, then in the military then on base housing etc.  I do not know where to draw the line or if we should.  To each his own.  At what point do we limit someone's freedom to live how they choose?  Im more of a mixed bag on these issues.  I would have no problem invading Mexico to topple all the drug violence and trade, on the other hand I don't have a real issue with illegal immigration.  I know that is contradictory, but from sometimes what is right is not beneficial.    
a liberal fence sitter that leans to the right ... hmm it is possible people, debate the facts! amazing!
FTA: 

&gt;Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said he would welcome Trump to the race.

&gt;"My view is, 'come on in, the water's fine. The more, the merrier,' " said Romney, the nominal frontrunner for the 2012 nomination, Tuesday night on CNBC.

&gt;But Romney was much more vocal on the issue of Obama's birthplace.

&gt;"I think the citizenship test has been passed. I believe the president was born in the United States," Romney said. "The man needs to be taken out of office, but his citizenship isn't the reason why."
Trump knows he is a citizen. He also knows any press is good press. Especially for someone new to the race. This is another chance for him to be a problem solver, getting to the bottom of something! 

He knows how to attract attention. Like when he called Ron Paul a loser.
Speaking of losers, some Libertarian sent me a message a couple of minutes ago but I think he meant to send it to some other guy. See [here](http://i.imgur.com/THxqK.jpg)
but but but Islam is peaceful!!!!!!!! /s
I hope they both lose.
I'm no Republican.
There's no link buddy.
Yup. No matter what political ideals you stand for, left or right, Mitt Romney will turn his back on you, eventually.
Well, that was a spanking, if ever there was one.
Good.
Good for them.

I hate to interrupt this discussion but I just want to point something out:

To say that we could do to Afghanistan what we did to Japan is, in my opinion, an unfeasible dream. The circumstances surrounding Japan's success are vastly different from the circumstances surrounding Afghanistan.

Also, while we did set up a government in Japan and write their constitution, their economic subculture was still in place. We did not govern the place alone, we merely set up a framework that the Japanese culture was able to adapt to. We only did half the work.

To do the same in Afghanistan would, I feel, be a waste of time. Why should we try to take over a nation that doesn't want us there, when we have no reason to be there in the first place? Why did we go to Afghanistan? To hunt down a terrorist organization, not to neuter the country.
I think you misrepresent the opinions of many liberal redditors here.

Liberals who are against a hard stance on immigration are well aware of the fact that it is bad for the country. However, the fact that they're coming over illegally isn't necessarily the problem - it's the fact that they're taking jobs at low wages, and that employers are willing to pay them these wages under the table. If we were to provide amnesty and put more enforcement on the employers to keep the wages up to the minimum wage, that could knock out the economic issue.

As for the issue of immigration specifically, that's more of an ideological thing. I personally don't think that to be a member of this country you need to learn English, especially not via studying the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. To say that passing the test makes you a citizen - well, how about the white people who were born here who would fail that test? Are they suddenly not as American as they "should" be?

You say that you find liberals arguing without facts, but everything you've said is anecdotal. Illegals bring crime to our streets? You mean the crime of being an illegal immigrant? How do they "teach how TX to Cali will become part of Mexico once again"? I have met many Hispanic immigrants, legal and illegal, and none of them have held the opinion that Mexico will retake that land, much less taught it to others. Why is flying the Mexican flag at a courthouse wrong? Is that not a part of that state's history? If South Carolina flies the Confederate flag I think Texas can fly the Mexican flag without it meaning "Mexico will take over".

I also know many vets, and few of them found homosexuals "distracting". The only ones who did were anti-gay before going into the military. It's an issue if you make it an issue.

And why can't gays live in base housing with their life partners? Why can't they have their benefits? Why can't they get equal treatment?

And why is it such an issue to teach your kids why two men next door are kissing? Why? Is it because your bible says it's wrong, or is it because for some reason you are uncomfortable with homosexuality? There is no difference between a man and woman kissing and two men or two women kissing, unless you make a difference. You're making it difficult to teach your kids about it. There is nothing objective or external making it difficult.
&gt; the fact that they're coming over illegally isn't necessarily the problem - it's the fact that they're taking jobs at low wages

i almost read your bullshit! in your little spat there you tore down the borders, shit all of the constitution and the bill of rights. allowed another nation to claim a city that isn't theirs without a war and you have fought for special rights for the queers. YOU ARE A GREAT AMERICAN! 

I bet your grandfather would be proud.
So you complain about us not debating the facts, but you don't bother to read my post, much less make a counterargument with facts. Or research.

So am I only a great American if I agree with you? That doesn't sound very... American.
If someone says their a Republican and smokes dope, takes socialized medicine and has abortions are they "Republican"?
No. 

Your talking about Rino's, not real republicans.

you didn't lay out any facts..  just your opinion.
Yeah, it's nice to see even a small handful of Republicans actually doing their jobs honestly in some way.
As an oldschool Republican, I'm againts planned parenthood, but I've got to try to tell some of these younger ones like teapartyers and so forth, YOUR MAKING THE GOP LOOK CRAZY!
Teapartier types just can't wait to critcize Mike Huckabee, and YOUR MAKING THE GOP LOOK CRAZY!

Go back and read Eisenhower's books and you'll learn some things.

Nutty nutty people like Mr. Paul, YOUR MAKING THE GOP LOOK CRAZY!

Get a clue, Ron.
Just curious. Why are Republicans against Planned Parenthood?

That would be a snappy comeback if it wasn't so easy to point out bizarre and wacky statements from Ron Paul.

Just Google "wacky Ron Paul" and see what you get!

Here's just one example:

http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2007/10/ron-paul-still-.html

And why would you assume that the other poster doesn't like the constitution?  Nothing was mentioned about that at all.

In other words, you seem kind of nutty yourself.

Sounds like you're "against" spelling and book learnin too...
Yes, you get a horrible blog post with no facts.  Did you read the comments.  They destroyed that poor guy on a factual basis.

"Ron Paul is "nutty" because he hand-wrote a letter to supporters, he wants out of the UN, and he opposes the NAU?

If that's "nutty," sign my ass up! " I agree.
That's the reason why they are doing this actually. They believe by destroying the EPA, companies will be able to do more of what they want and thus be able to hire more people. It's a trade off, the environment in exchange for jobs.
Except it's not working.  Companies are making record profits, paying record executive bonuses, CEO pay is up 27%.  But none of that is helping the job market.  
This was a pointless gesture, to be honest. To cut planned parenthood was nothing more than symbolic. If they were serious about making the kind of spending cuts the budget needs, they would have done something alot more serious. A few million to PP is a joke.
See comment above yours to argue the opposite.
Another person who does not know the definition of Socialism...
ZOMG THERE ARE REDS ON REDDIT?
Why don't Democrats give back their tax cuts?
Because some Planned Parenthood's provided abortion services; to lazy to find it but I think it's only 3% of the business of the services they provide.  Most people don't even know what Planned parenthood does, so naturally it seems a lot of people assume they're a baby killing factory in the local neighborhood.
[deleted]
Make it to the last line of the article - "Police stressed, however, that there was no concrete evidence that the attack had either a religious or a political motive."
Gingrich is the man.
Maybe because they are the largest abortion providers in the nation? 
And the GOP is mad because tax dollars support Planned Parenthood, or is it an issue that causes qualms with a moral position?

Yeah, too bad the vast majority of Republicans are basically thugs who work in favor of the interests of the richest Americans.  And they lie and distort the facts to achieve that.
Or stand next to you just long enough to get you to vote for him
I'm amazed that people still believe that paying taxes entitles them to demand that every single tax dollar be spent only on the programs they agree with.

Once the money's in the pot, it's no longer YOURS.  It belongs to the government to be spent on government programs.  The money being spent on these programs is a tiny portion of overall tax revenues; what gives you the right to micromanage every cent, especially when there are billions in tax dollars coming in from people who AGREE with it being used this way?
This sort of anti-intellectualism is so damaging for a civilized society I can't even begin to describe it.  When we refer to our learned people as "eggheads" as if having a degree makes them somehow INFERIOR, I have to wonder where American society went wrong.  
I cannot for the life of me figure out why people dislike Hillary so much.  She's an intelligent, reasonable woman, and I've seen nothing from her that would lead me to believe otherwise.  
Listen to his show.. it is even funnier.
In my experience those people are called hypocrites, you find a lot of them in the Republican party
By Republicans do you mean the Politicans or individuals with a political ideology? 
True. You find them everywhere. Take for instance a few years ago when the Left blamed Bush for high gas prices and war but yet now they love high gas prices and war.
Ha. The other headline is pretty good too. Good pick.
[deleted]
All I'm saying is that even if someone opposes government program "X," as a taxpayer and citizen, they still have a right to enjoy the benefits of program X. So Republicans have every right to enjoy government-paid healthcare, while Democrats have every right to enjoy tax cuts.
Also, I took the question to mean why don't Republican *legislators* reject their government healthcare (as opposed to laymen Republicans)? In which case the answer is easy- they are government employees, and thus are eligible for public employee benefits. That is a **very** different concept from extending those benefits to everyone in the United States, public employee or not.
Don't destroy medicare, fools!
Is it the birth control or the cancer screenings that bother you most?
Medicare works just fine when its benefits are reserved for the use of those that contributed to the medicare fund ( payed taxes).  All socialist programs work when every citizen works, but neo-socialist don't want to work, they just want to be in charge.
In 2008 Paul's campaign's reaction to this was politically disastrous. Paul runs an amateur campaign, blowing $40 million in 08. He even tried to start of for profit book publishing business from his campaign funds. 
I have to disagree.  Everyone who isn't a dye-in-the-wool Republican is turned off by the extremism in the current Republican party.  Most of them are turned off by that a LOT more than they are with Obama's failings.  And people see Obama's biggest failings as being that he's too Republican (I know I hate him because he's essentially Bush the Third), so while they'd like to have another option, they won't be voting for a Republican over him.
Here is a big shocker: most people who aren't hardcore liberals are turned off by the extremism in the democrat party. I'm not saying your wrong but your victim to a big blind spot in your world view. Partisanship is a disease.
This clearly wasn’t the way Florida Gov. Rick Scott, R-Distant Galaxy, reckoned it would be. 

Scott, who hitched his political circus wagon to the Tea Party agenda on his way to buying the GOP nomination and the governor‘s mansion, awakened this week to news his approval ratings were fast approaching Nixon train wreck territory.

He's on track to be a strong candidate for Buffoon of the Century! 
He's got my vote!
Would seem this article needs a huge dose of reading comprhension.  Not once did I see Mr. Paul show sympathy for terrorists.  He states he would track down Osama, but would not violate another countries rights to do so.  I suppose some people only see what they want to see.  Also Mr. Paul is a huge conservative.  His fiscal policy, view on abortion, small government stance is the epitomy of a conservative.
I didn't realize conservatives are racist. But then again there aren't many blacks at those Tea Party meetings.
Ron Paul isn't a part of the new Tea Party.  He founded the original one, but left after the entire meaning of what it stood for changed.  Do you even know anything about this guy?
This article is such an assault on reason it actually hurt to read it
Has Obama's arrogance overtaken his political preservation instinct?
He knows, but he's obviously not here to have a balanced and objective discussion on the subject...
Everything kid. He and others are claiming he is the Godfather of the Tea Party. You are correct, the Tea Party stole the name and kicked his ass to the curb. Happens to him all the time

Fact remains you won't see many blacks at a Ron Paul rally. 
You still don't get it.  It's not about the 'Tea Party', or even about Paul himself - it's about the idea *behind* the movement and Paul's campaign.  People are waking up to the fact that neither mainstream party serves their interests anymore, and momentum is building for a popular political upheaval to take the government back.  And it's not just in this country - you're seeing it in Europe and the Middle East as we speak, and we're not far behind.  People the world over are tired of the bullshit.

You can hijack a name, and you can marginalize a candidate, but "you can't stop an idea who's time has come."  Get on board or get out of the way.
That's funny Rich. I think you way overate the winds of change, at least in this country, The Middle East is different. Let's see how few votes the 3rd parties get in 2012.
Left? You mean they didn't want anything to do with him. Which is pretty much standard practice with Ron. Even the few decent ideas he has he takes to extremes. That's why he is constantly kicked to the curb!
Ron Paul is running on the Republican ticket.  Either you're a troll or a very uninformed moron.
Yes, I know that. Richmomz said people are rejecting both parties. 3rd party  results will prove or disprove that. Paul is not a Republican. He is a Libertarian disguised as a Republican.
He's what a  real republican is supposed to be.  The only non republican thing about him is that he stands for what he believes in, although that could be said about any politician.
Look at the polls' numbers, in comparison to Ron Paul. Paul has one thing that he outpolls Cain in -- voter recognition (which, according to the first chart, works against him).
Ron has a cult behind him!

Rand must be really jealous that his dad is still more popular with the freaks than he is! 
At least you can get a handle on Ron's insanity. Rand is all over the place in his beliefs. 
FTA:

  Gary Johnson is a whiney has-been running on a vague platform that pretty much states the obvious.  Ron Paul is an extremist who won’t even attempt to attract conservative or non-libertarian voters.
He is 100% Pro-Life and opposes abortion in all circumstances including rape and incest.
NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND SUPPORTS RON PAUL! 
That's silly. How can this possibly be a true statement? Jcm, always spreading hyperbole and emotive propaganda, eh?
FWIW *you* are an insane person who supports Ron Paul. 
Baseless personal attacks? Is that really the best defense you can come up with? You're slipping. Need to go back to troll school.

Anyway, you haven't invalidated my argument or more effectively supported yours by your attempt at insulting me.
I'm not attempting to insult you I'm simply stating facts, son. You are a crazy person. I even have you labeled as such in RES. Why would I do that if you weren't crazy?

I guess the safe thing to do is to vote for a safe candidate.  To vote for more of the same.  Same wars.  Same controversies.  Same debt.  Same same same.  No changes, no solutions, more obfuscation, increased restrictions, moral traditions embodied and codified into law, protection of old stagnant industries, protection of the war economy, protection of the intelligence industry, deliberate neglect of vital civil infrastructure, etcetera, etcetera.

Your typical Republican conservatism is the status quo *embodied as an ideology*.  Take no chances, and never look past the next election or even the next economic quarter.  Fix nothing serious.  Distract populous with meaningless tripe.

I'll admit, candidates that are different aren't always great either. Especially if they are voted in only *because* they are different.  **We've sure learned that with Obama haven't we?** Woops, I guess we should have continued to vote for more of the same.  Another Neocon perhaps?  McCain probably would have done the same stuff, but we'll never know, at least he is a Republican, and Republicans are a safe bet, aren't they?

IMO (I expect you to disagree), liking Ron Paul is not a symptom of insanity.

What may be crazy is the idea that he could ever win the Republican nomination.  But rather than be defeatist, I'll vote for him in the primaries and see where it goes from there.
Obama isn't the same as Bush/Republicans you fucking ignoramus. He's way different! 

Liking Ron Paul most definitely IS a symptom of insanity. Supporting Ron Paul could also be caused by a strong dislike of America or extreme ignorance, though. 
Like Ron Paul == Hate America?

Ok.

You know, people who are crazy don't tend to realize it, and sometimes they go as far as to think that it's everyone else who's nuts.  Just sayin.
Why wasn't this posted to the r/republicans? Its been almost 2 full weeks. It shows up in my posts but not on the main board?
Yep. Ron Paul supporters, who are not very large in number, think the other people are all "sheeple" and that both parties are the same, etc. Ron Paul's a cult leader! 

Funny you bring this up, howitzer86, considering you were just giving me the "they're all the same!" line of BS in the previous comment you left for me. 
Don't mind jcm267, he's just a troll. He and several of his friends have an obsession with attacking Ron Paul and conspiracy theories, and anybody that even thinks of considering them. It's really unfortunate because the emotional attacks are actually proven techniques which scare the moderate folks away form examining the subjects or discussing them in public.
If there is a way to alienate voters, Ron Paul is sure to find it!
He also doesn't know the difference between the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence 
This article mentions nothing about alienating voters.  Please explain how opinions of the national deficit alienate gop voters.

Dr. Paul said Boehner's proposal to match any increase in the debt ceiling with an equal amount of spending cuts will fail like the same plan Reagan had in the 80's.
uuuuuggggghhhhh NEVER
Extremest? Do you mean extremist?  Oh, come on, they're both extremists.
Don't worry, we'll just spend our way out of the debt crisis.  Problem solved!

Now, go back to sleep, and don't listen to anything that kooky old man has to say...
Better yet, he would throw himself in prison: http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/388801/june-07-2011/the-word---hear-no-evil

That's right, and now the AFA and Rick Perry are saying non-Christians are welcome to come, so that they can be converted to Christianity
I think that saying Ronald Reagan and his horrible Reaganomics program a failure would severely affect GOP opinions of him considering that this country is favoring a supply-side economic policy right now in terms of taxation.
Better idea: supply-side economics! History shows that...oh wait...it failed? Hmm...well...shit.
Herman Cain is arguably the blandest republican candidate running, and has the least political experience. But hey if he can run a pizza company, he's obviously fit to run the American empire...
She gave them good copy.
Wow.  I didn't know CNN responded to politics that weren't on twitter anymore.  
Frankly, opposition to raising the debt ceiling is a political move, and opening up the US to refusal to raise the debt ceiling is a wingnut move. I don't personally believe in the legitimacy of credit rating agencies, but that doesn't mean that the US can be downgraded with no serious impact. What exactly is the save-the-debt-ceiling crowd's strategy for responding to this?

Egal der Verfall des Grundgesetzes,egal der Verfall der Werte,machen wir doch weiter so.
Sehr geehrter Herr Kelber,
sind Sie sich sicher das Ihr Vorschlag ins Grundgesetz aufgenommen werden sollte?
1.)Um das Grundgesetz kümmert sich im Ernstfall sowieso niemand.
2.) Selbst im Normalzustand eines Landes kümmert das GG niemanden
nicht einmal Beamte des Staates,die ja eignentlich dazu da sein sollen,das GG zu beachten.
 Wie wäre es sonst möglich,das meine Frau immer noch kein Visum für
  Deutschland hat.(im GG steht das Familie geschützt ist)einige Beamte
 wollen sich hervortun und schmeissen Menschenrechte,internationale Vereinbarungen,
 diverse Deutsche Gesetze über Bord ,auf Grund einer V e r m u t u n g ,einer 
wahrscheinlich unbefriedigten Beamtin im Ausländeramt Hamburg.Denn dort wurde eine
Vermutung geboren,weil ich schon dreimal mit einer Ausländerin verheiratet war,
 (Scheinehe).
Aber: das erste Mal   7 J a h r e
           das zweite M  15 J a h r e
           das dritte M     1,5 Jahre,aber nur deshalb weil Sie mir verstorben ist.                                                            	sonst brauchte ich nicht neu zu heiraten,und mich diesem Terror auszu setzen.

Psychologische Folter in Deutschland

FTA:

Romney has not much changed over the past four years. Romney’s party has. Even as Romney has taken first place in Republican opinion polls, the most conservative Republicans have turned against him. Two weeks ago, Rush Limbaugh formally pronounced, “Bye-bye nomination.”

But Republicans must nominate somebody. If not Romney, then who?

Sarah Palin has flamed out. House members Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul are obviously marginal and unelectable. Governors like Indiana’s Mitch Daniels, Mississippi’s Haley Barbour, and New Jersey’s Chris Christie have declined to enter the race.
Mitt Romney wears magic underwear!
In the next couple of years, too! We have a timeframe to go by here! 
You should know this about the OP

http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/i340b/ron_paul_wins_rlc_straw_poll/c20iv47

Ron Paul supporter is responsible for shooting Giffords and the constitution is outdated and void. 
What a loon. This is the same douchebag that predicted the housing bubble in 2001. What a crazy!
Geez.. the same guy said to buy gold.. LOL.. only crazy people buy gold.

Obama hasn't spread the wealth around. He's just sucked it out of our hands and given it to the Wall Street gangsters and Insurance companies that screwed us over to begin with.
And still the people of this subreddit delight in dropping to their knees for their corporate masters.  Enjoy the long, salty, shaft my friends.
I thought Ron Paul did awesome in the debate, he's the only one with common sense. Hopefully he's the next president.
In 2009 he predicted a 15 year depression! He predicted total collapse back in the 1980's. He's a doomsday guy hoping to get one right!
You would have been better off buying stocks. 
Exactly.  Furthermore, there isn't a single proposed budget from anyone, Republican or otherwise, which balances the budget.  Each one runs a deficit, which means that every one, including the Ryan one, requires you to raise the debt ceiling.  

Running a deficit is bad, but running a deficit while also saying you refuse to take on more debt is anti-reality craziness.

That said, any proposals on how to not raise the debt ceiling by actually balancing the budget would be quite welcome to me.
this.
For the same reason that, once upon a time, I was taught to hate them, and think of them as "Godless Communists," or "Commie Scum."  

I figure that the typical person really has little call to hate a person on the other side of the world.  Leaders, who have the political disagreements and maybe even antagonism toward each other (note I don't say "hatred of each other") need a way to get the support of their respective citizens if there is not an overarching, existential threat.
&gt;...if someone is attending speeches from someone who is promoting the violent overthrow of our government, that’s really an offense that we should be going after — they should be deported or put in prison.

I doubt there is a single Senator who would not agree with this. Downvoting due to a sensationalize title.

The GOP is a mess...
What is it about Ron Paul that has your support?
I prefer Ron Paul, because out of all the candidates he's the only one who seems to have really read the constitution.  

He's anti-war, anti government intrusion, and as far as I'm aware of hasn't flipped on any of his beliefs.  

He's my favorite so far, because he's the least full of bullshit.
Sounds like Obama's campaign, minus healthcare and bipartisanship, and plus a crowd-pleasing "small government" message to ensure a republican interest. 
When was Obama against government intrusion?  
"and plus a crowd-pleasing "small government" message to ensure a republican interest."
Buying out GMC is not small government.  
16,5000 new IRS agents to delve into your health insurance is not small government.
Still paying 5,000 people for cash for clunkers (it's over isn't it?) is not small government.  

When has he done anything significantly to shrink the size or increase the responsibility of the federal government?
[deleted]
So far Bachmann appears to be the lesser of all evils. She's not "Sarah Palin light" as the media is attempting to portray her. She appears to be fairly intelligent, but has the same foot/mouth disease that Joe Biden suffers from. If she wises up just a little more and stops making the crackpot statements that get her into trouble, she might pull off the nomination.
I'm not actually a Republican (my political views are a weird intermingling of Progressivism and Libertarianism with Fiscal Conservatism during booms...), but I think I'd support Huntsman (Obama's been a letdown for me). He seems like one of the more moderate, saner Republican candidates out there. I haven't been following all that closely though. Has he said anything crazy/done anything stupid?
You're not reading very well, today. 
As a centrist who supported Obama, but has become a little... annoyed... with his focus on bipartisanship and not on fulfilling his campaign promises, (Face it, Obama, the republicans will oppose ANYTHING you do, stop trying to compromise and fucking DO something!) I can still say that any TEA party member is too far out there to win my vote away from the democrats right now. I think, (I could very well be wrong, but...) I think that if the Republicans go too far right with their pick, the swing voters in the middle like me, who are willing to consider a republican if they have the right direction, would just say, "I may not be happy with Obama entirely, but he's better than THAT ball of fucked up." (I may be paraphrasing, of course.) Wouldn't they do well to choose a moderate republican, rather than an extremist? Most democrats will vote democrat, most republicans will vote republican. But no swing voter with a slight slant would ever choose someone too far one way or the other.
I still support Condie Rice. But since she won't run on her own, I have been e-mail blitzing Mitt Romney to try and get her in as VP.

I'll vote Obama before I vote Palin, Bachman, Huckster, Cain, Rudy, Trump... WTF!?!?! TRUMP!?!?!??! That almost made me vote Obama for sure!
Rubio 2016. Or Rice if she makes a comeback.

They've got to do something about the tea partiers...
.
Coming from a Dem here, I honestly think they want her to win so Obama can wipe the floor with her.  Its the only explanation I have.  I dont necessarily think its the news that is propagating the story though.  I think the democratic strategists are doing it behind the scenes.  If you watch any interview, they all say Bachmann did great.
Making abortion illegal is not small government.  Stomping out unions is not small government.  Paying off supreme court justices is not small government.  Rewarding the rich on the backs of the middle class is not small government.
Usually, its the people that dont pay close attention that aren't happy with Obama.  You can't just read the headlines.  You have to investigate for yourself.  Pay closer attention and you will revote for Obama.
I dont think Trump, Palin, Newt, or even Bachmann are serious.  I think they just want to sell books and make money off of the republican base.  I mean, look at Newt's debt.  Bachmann has wanted to be Palin for as long as she's been in the public eye.  Its insane.
Oh my god.  You think this nut job is intelligent? She is dumber than Sarah Palin.  Palin might not know legislature, but she is a smart person.   Bachmann has nothing but tumble-weeds up there.
Are you serious? Bachmann has a 4-year law degree, she was a tax attorney for the IRS for 5 years, she served in the Minnesota state Senate (her election overturned an 18-year veteran), and she's been serving in the U.S. House of Reps for the past 7 years.

So what exactly constitutes her as "dumb" in your opinion?  
Tea Party loves Rubio. No reason they wouldn't love rice either.
Agreed. But it is still embarrassing as all hell.
Bullshit. He didn't really end either war. He spent all of his political capital on Health Care Reform, and didn't even get single payer anyways. His stimulus was stupidly structured (~half was tax breaks). He didn't fight for the long term unemployed. He called his administration off of deeming China as currency manipulators as they are. I'm in the reddit minority on this, but he didn't support Israel (recent). He's an improvement over our previous president, but there's nothing there below the surface. When I look closer, I don't see anything to make me want to vote for Obama. The only reason I would vote for him is if the Republican candidate is a crazy (Bachman, Palin, Ron Paul etc.). Otherwise, no question I'd vote against him. He's been a fairly sucky president. He's the more eloquent version of Carter.
First his health care reform took so long because of the republicans in congress striping it and prolonging it, stating that it is unconstitutional. Second, the tax breaks in the stimulus i say was designed to stop the right media from saying that this is government take over and you need to buy a bomb shelter. Third Israel is a terrorist nation that we have been arming and supporting for free; don't believe me that they are terriost look up the definition of terrorist.
[deleted]
Did the Republicans play nice; no they did not. Does it matter me; no it does not. It's an excuse. If Obama could not sell health care well enough, and he couldn't ram it through either, I don't give him a pass (even if the Republicans did not play nice). I don't really care what the right wing media says. Those tax breaks shouldn't have been in the bill, and the cash should have been spent faster. Israel is not a terrorist nation. Please, when discussing, avoid use of bullshit.
Take your own advice.  Everything you say is bullshit.  Obama not backing israel is stupid partisan rhetoric.  

Just because obama didn't get you everything you want, doesn't make him a bad president.  He doesn't only represent you.  You're ever most selfish person I've ever heard
She's either an idiot, playing an idiot on tv, or a liar.  Either way,  she can't touch obama.  I just happen to believe she's an idiot.  

I have a college degree,  and I know plenty of dumbasses who were there getting one at the time.  College degrees are more about having money than being smart nowadays.
The GOP is the far right. Most Democrats are very near the center when it comes to issues and they have to compromise to the center right to get anything done. Republican politicians (not Republican citizens) are dangerous and radically far from the center. If we want to get moderate discussions and solutions we need to start voting for more far lefts and socialist in order to balance out this "bizzaro-USSR" we have now.
Its not like the republicans would even buy it, they spent so much time on the news stations making shit up about it without even reading it, an example would be the death panel. I agree 100% with you on the tax breaks. Israel has been violating human rights and clamming they are being attacked, even though they are the ones attacking ships carrying aid and food, this would be a prim example of a nation that uses its power to inflict suffering and death. You do realize that the British gave them that land because they could not control their colonies there. Since that time Israel has been invading neighboring lands and clamming that it was theirs 2000 years ago so it should be theirs now. When discussing use examples not stating something is bullshit without a proper discussion.
I think Jon Huntsman is the only Republican candidate I'd consider voting for over Obama (assuming the Tea Party doesn't force him *way* right). [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/18744295) had a good article about him a couple weeks ago.
I don't give examples because I don't feel like typing a multipage essay to school someone anonymously over the internet (and because the hivemind of reddit generally hates Israel pretty blindly). They don't go out of their way to inflict harm/suffering. The Israelis (particularly the older ones/the ones in power) are actually fairly peaceful with the exception of the settlers, an extreme minority. Theoretically speaking, they could fairly easily wipe out the Palestinians. They could probably wipe out the entire region in fact (Iran, Syria, Lebanon etc.). The fact that they don't do any of that speaks volumes to their self control/morality. They only attack aid ships that want to bring weapons. More worrying are the young Israelis. Unlike in America/Europe, the young are rather hawkish. They look at history/recent experience and see that with a few exceptions (Egypt), most peace attempts where Israel makes concessions--blow up in Israel's face. The Palestinians don't want a two state solution. They want a one state solution with the Israelis expelled. The youth of Israel probably does want to do all the horrible things you imagine Israel is doing.
To elaborate, my issue isn't so much his not backing them: it's more so his actively going against them. Asking for '67 borders is like crapping all over them. It's fairly indefensible, and it isn't an even compromise--it's outright supporting the Palestinians heavily over the Israelis. In general, I'm not disappointed with Obama because I didn't get everything that I want: I'm disappointed with Obama because I didn't get ANYTHING that I want. Read my list above. Why do you give him a pass for that stuff? He's the president. The most powerful man in the world, with access to the media 24/7. If one party goes retarded/obstructionist, you use the "bully pulpit" to get them to back down. I don't give him an excuse for his suckage. 
To clarify how wrong you are:  he didn't say to go back to the 1967 borders.  He said they need to come to an agreement that is based on the 1967 borders as a starting point for negotiations.  This yes nearly word for word what netanyahu said a few months prior.

You just think you are informed.  That's what is so sad.  You read the headlines but you don't know anything about what you're talking about.  
As to all your other "points" I an typing on a phone so I don't feel like typing for an hour just to school you over the internet.
Pick any one point you want and I'll school you on it
I think it's largely because this is (as yet) a comparatively low traffic subreddit on a site that's mostly Democratic-leaning.
*still right*
She attended Oral Roberts University Law School, which has since been re-branded as Christian Broadcast Network University, and now Regent University.  It's a fourth-tier school, consistently ranked among the worst in the nation.
Did she or did she not pass a BAR exam? Was she or was she not a tax attorney for the Federal government? You think just any idiot can pass the BAR and work for the Fed in a technical position like that?
To your third question, emphatically yes, and if you disagree by all means come to Washington and see some of the goons who inhabit federal offices these days.

Also, Frank Abagnale passed the bar exam without attending law school, and on the flipside being in a specialized field does not imbue one with intelligence.
You are arguing against a position that nobody is taking.  You really need to pay more attention to what people say.
Frank Abagnale? You're using HIM as an example?  Okay, yeah, sure he passed the BAR exam - IN FREAKING 1967!  So what's you're point?  You're comparing a famous huckster, who at the age of 19 was able to forge documents in a highly sophisticated manner, who was obviously extremely intelligent (although misguided), to Michelle Bachmann?  I'm not sure how this proves your point, really.

Yeah, there are some real dim bulbs in Washington, but I'm not convinced Bachmann is one of them.  Despite what you think, it does take a level of intelligence, effort, and determination to achieve what she has in her life.  
is this seriously the only post that's ever been made in this subreddit? lol
I'm for Huntsman.  Tons of foreign policy experience.  Moderate on social issues but fiscally conservative.  My kind of guy!

That said, it's going to be hard for him to break through the cacophony of all of the other republicans.
Lol, there were like, five others when I posted it. Not the most popular place, is it?

Go Nader!
You think every Senator would support throwing someone in jail simply for going and listening? When did listening become a crime?
Herman Cain.  "Real clear" foreign policy, business leader instead of a government guy, and if the "racist" repubs vote a black man in, the race card will be dead!
Because we enjoy the freedom to make money and live a life of our own, and for some reason the commies couldn't stand that.  They saw it as greed, hence the "pigs".  They thought the government should control every aspect of people's lives.  
I would vote for Huntsman and possibly Romney or Pawlenty.  If it is none of those three, it'll be Obama again.  In the end, it probably doesn't matter.  I can't see any of the potential Republicans coming anywhere close to Obama.
How are you at +6 in /r/Republicans?  Are there more socialists than actual Republicans here?
Abortion is illegal now?  Unions have been "stomped out?"  Supreme Court justices have been paid off?  Our progressive income tax isn't progressive enough despite the top 50% of earners paying 97% of the tax?  What world do you live in, piaband?
You didn't school him at all, and you're only embarrassing yourself by being so hyperbolic.
Be honest: have you ever voted for a Republican?
So, where's your law degree?  What level of education do you have?  You're embarrassing yourself again.
&gt;Most Democrats are very near the center

Near the centre of the Right I think you mean
If their wasn't so much propaganda out there, I think more Republicans would be socialists. I can't think of a reason why anybody who makes less that 100k would vote Republican other than blind ideology.
I have only voted twice in my life, mainly due to my age (23) and the fact that I move around a lot, which limits my ability to get in to vote, and limits the practicality of absentee voting, depending on where I am. Of the times I have voted, one was for Obama, and one was in 2010. Of those I chose for my local government, I believe I voted for a Republican treasurer and a Republican for another office that I can't remember at the moment, (possibly something to do with education, but offhand, I'm not certain enough to say). Despite my best efforts, Rick Scott still won governor.


I find myself gravitating towards the democrats, but I have to say, I really like a few of the "smaller" republicans. By which I mean the state and local guys who have a better grasp on day-to-day life for their constituents. As the issues go, I'm almost split 50-50. I dislike the government interfering with state's rights, but I dislike the states interfering with human rights. I support the republican view on firearms, and the republican view on the border control issues (usually). On the other hand, I see no moral problems with abortion, gay marriage, healthcare and the like... I think the reason I have voted for more Democrats than Republicans in the last two elections has been due to a heavy dislike of many of Bush's policies. I felt that a turn in the other direction was needed to fix those problems caused between 2000 and 2008. In any other election, McCain may have had my vote, I really liked him over most other Republicans. However... well, McCain's similarity to Bush and his VP pick shut that down pretty damn quick. I'll admit that Obama hasn't lived up to my expectations, but I still stand by my choice for him over McCain.
You really bit into all the class warfare, didn't you?

The top 50% of earners pay 97% of the federal income tax.  You don't think that's already enough?  Jesus, it's not even a flat tax.
Well, unfortunately, while all the information will show that that is true, it's really the top 47% of earners who pay 97% of federal income taxes. Whereas the the top 3% who hold 95% of the wealth in this country pay practically nothing due to loopholes and the fact that they have oligarchic control of the U.S. government. Start realizing that it is this top 3% making my and your life shitty. It is a class warfare, but not between people like you and I. But, this is exactly what they want, isn't it? Us debating rather than confronting them. Divide and conquer - the oldest trick in the book.

Okay, keep fucking that chicken, meanwhile, I'll make something of my life.  The wealthy don't owe me anything, and I don't feel entitled to any of their earnings.  Shame on you for thinking that I was.
Do you see what I mean? I do think they owe us plenty. They have had complete control for generations, they've mismanaged our resources, they accepted hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds when it was in no way our fault that their corporations fell apart, etc. etc. Why do we continually allow people who have lied, cheated, and stole their way to the top to keep fucking us in the ass repeatedly? I'm not trying to attack you, I'm want you to look at things for my perspective and I want to see things from yours. From where I'm sitting now, though, it looks like you are over looking the ass raping you get on a daily basis in the defense of what exactly, "freedom?"
Who has had complete control?  The wealthy?  Control of what?  How?  How have they mismanaged anything?  Are you implying that our government is fascist?

Yes, corporations received public funds, NOT wealthy individuals (maybe you were confusing the two).

All successful people have "lied, cheated, and stole" their way to the top?  Jesus Christ, man.  Get a grip on yourself.

Can you restate what you just said, but this time factually and without all the hyperbole?  Did a CEO rape you as a kid or something?  Why so much animosity towards people that have nothing to do with your current situation?

EDIT:  Here's a litmus test: does Bill Gates, one of the wealthiest individuals in the United States, owe you anything?  Did he exploit you in any manner?
I'm afraid I can't succinctly reply to this. I'd like to have a conversation not write a book. I know, it made me really angry at first too, but you've got to keep a cool head. What's with all this "get a grip" "I'll make something of my life" bull shit? I like talking to people who disagree with me, but we don't have to be assholes to each other. Look, I want to understand why you think what you think and I want you to understand why I think the way I do, but you're jumping around too much. Think about the things I said that make you angry and let's focus on one things at a time.

But first, I need to know one thing: Is it a higher measure of success to accumulate wealth or to provide something that is well-designed, responsible, and beneficial/desired by society? 
You can't respond to anything I wrote, or you choose not to?

Please explain what you meant by the "lied, cheated, and stole" comment.  Also, what about Bill Gates?

I'm afraid I can't succinctly reply to you if you keep dodging simple questions.
I chose not to sit here and write 5,000 words in response to everything you asked.

You said yourself that "all successful people have lied, cheated, and stole their way to the top." So, what about that don't you understand? People with a lot of money fund political campaigns and "news" organizations that lie (see Politifact.org to scratch the surface). And I'm not just talking about conservative mouthpieces, to be clear. A debate has been fabricated about Global Warming to keep oil sales up. I don't want to get into a debate on Global Warming mind you because then we'd be buying in. There are plenty of obvious reasons when you look at the substances emitted by automobiles that fossil fuels aren't safe. So why are we talking about global climatological phenomenon that no one really understands? The bailouts look like stealing to me. I mean why was this what you needed to understand? I think it's pretty clear.  

And why are we so concerned about Bill Gates? He has done a lot of good with his riches. Also, every company he's ever worked with to provide machines that run Windows last 3-4 years operating at peak performance. This is planed obsolescence. So OK he's helped cure a lot of malaria, but also put his brand on hundreds of millions of PCs that were shoddily designed and made with inferior resources that ended up being unnecessary waste. But I don't think he's a fair representation of the aristocracy.

And actually you did succinctly reply, I wasn't trying to dodge anything. I want to have a constructive conversation, but we can't do that if you attack everything I say. Furthermore, I don't think any of your questions have been "simple." Also, I'd like to know your thoughts on my "simple" question.
Ohh, so you're not implying that all successful people "lied, cheated, and stole their way to the top."  Just the corrupt ones, right?
The Pauls are only for smaller govt that they agree with.

Their words are all a shell game.
I never said anything about "all successful people," you did. 

Furthermore, I don't think it's necessarily their fault. They're responsible for the actions, and so are we. But, I think the problem is systemic more than anything. The purpose of a business is to generate income. The better businessperson one is the more income they will generate. So, the most successful people, and the people who end up managing our resources, our environment, our scientific research, our medicine and so on and so forth are not scientists, engineers, medical professionals, and ecologists; they're businesspeople. 

An ecologist would not sign off on a project that dumped carcinogenic waste into a river that fed into a reservoir because it would have disastrous effects on the environment and the people in the area, especially children. But a businessperson would simply because it was the cheapest way to dispose of their company's waste. And then all those kids get cancer. Cancer research is a big industry because of our polluted environment and poor food quality. But the hospital is a business too, and they make more money treating not curing. It's a sick cycle, and it boils down to one thing: generating income rather than solving real problems. 

The free market doesn't work in every context. Someone makes a product, we buy the product (which is our fault), and the product ends up being more detrimental to society rather than beneficial. 

So, I ask again, before we move on: Is it a higher measure of success to accumulate wealth or to provide something that is well-designed, responsible, and beneficial/desired by society?
So obviously, Herman Cain the Muslim hater is the best choice.
[Santorum](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Santorum)...  Nuff said about him.
Are you saying the Republics in this subreddit will automatically downvote any logical argument against their ideologies? 
You are mistaken. The republicans are right of center. They are not far right. 
Why did you write that? It means nothing.
Hmm, the governor of Texas has name recognition in Texas. Interesting /s.
Most people don't know that he used to be a Democrat, and chaired Al Gore's presidential campaign during the Texas primaries in 1988.  Once that comes out (and it will if he runs) he would have absolutely 0% chance of winning.
How has this been sitting on my front page? With no votes and no comments?

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Because there's gonna be a big blue circle jerk in here anyway, why let it sit in the new queue?
IllatEast, leave it alone. You can't have conversations with people that have a shitstorm and bombard you with 50 buzzwords making demands that you eloquently reply to their fear-riddled A.D.D. sentence. Before you can have a discussion with anyone, they must be willing to listen. Defensive/angry arguing (what KeithLOLbermann is doing) brings nothing to the table. I'm only sorry that I'm 3 days too late to say this (I just happened to wander into this subreddit)
You're right, but I assume that you're way to make it better would be to call for higher taxes on these corporations. You aren't looking at what has caused this gap in income, you just see it, complain about how it isn't fair, and demand their money. What you should be looking at instead are the obscene regulations that are forced upon businesses that attempt to compete with these giants. Getting rid of regulations would begin to level the playing field between big and small businesses, resulting in more competition and better consumer values. 
Who the fuck are you to tell everyone else what is "well-designed, responsible and beneficial"? That's the part you people don't understand. In a (real) free market system nobody has that power, and that is the beauty of it! Wealth is directly linked with creating something beneficial to the individual. Take basketball players for example: You probably think they are overpaid and don't do any good. I do, therefore I have the right to pay 50 bucks to go see a game. With your philosophy, I would be stripped of my right to do so. Everyone gets a say in a free market.
Your first comment refers mostly to topics early on in that conversation, and at that point I was simply responding to start a conversation but now were in the middle of it, so let's just dive in. I don't think businesses should be regulated either, because I don't think there should be businesses. I don't think we should use a monetary system. I think we should be concerned with what is important - our resources. In the end, that's all your making money for anyhow, right? I believe that a civilized society would consider the resources on this planet to be common heritage. In other words, what is necessary for life, eating, drinking, shelter,  and social and intellectual stimulation, should be considered a basic, god-given (if you will) rights just like free speech. We have the technology and the resources to do so, but we wrapped up in this little game we like play. I think everyone should have the right and the ability to, after their basic needs are met, go out and fulfill their lives without bounds and contribute to society, make it better without all the red tape and corruption and politics and regulation even. I think people should be able to play basketball because they enjoy it and go watch it because they enjoy it, and that's the end of that. And guess what? The free market would in sense continue to work - the best ball players would be the ones playing or the best at [insert work, hobby, passion of yours] would be able to pursue it to best of his or her ability. If others liked what you were contributing they will use it. I don't think the system we have in place is horrible, but its not the best, and it certainly doesn't offer the most potential for opportunity and creativity. Maybe Lebron James has the potential to build us a ship that'll go to Mars, but he's to busy playing basketball - where the *real* money's at. (that was a joke). I know this a lot to chew on, but remember I'm not attacking you, I'm not arguing with you, I want to move forward and not go back and forth over the same stale debates. We're better than this, and I know you might just be freaking out right now and wanting to write me an angry reply, but I've heard it all, I'm insane, I'm unrealistic, I'm a communist etc. etc., so go ahead and get angry and I'll probably stop talking to you, which is what you want because I make that vein in your head pop out, but if by any off chance I've peaked your curiosity and maybe pissed you off, please don't attack me either, ask me questions, learn about my perspective (as I'd like to learn about yours) and we can have a civilized debate, if you'd like. 

Edit: and, by the way, in response to your post, "well-designed and responsible" (I think I covered beneficial up there) are not, I believe, matters of opinion. I think they are objective, scientific notions. Quite often the stuff we want as individuals wastes resource and provides little benefit. Now I'm not against creating things that provide little benefit for society, and I believe individuals have the right to things like that. But I think what they cost us in resource should directly correlate to their level of benefit. But major things that we all use like transportation, energy, sewers and so on should always take into account what wastes the most and benefits the most. Because if we waste all of our resources making sure each individual is wasting as much as possible on things that provide transient, vain benefit than we will collapse as a society, and if we do that there will be no individuals to enjoy these things.
So you want Olivia Cromwell and the Religious Round Heads in charge?
[deleted]
Would you mind telling me a bit more about your reasoning? 
[deleted]
I thought all new posts appear at the bottom unless they're upvoted. Have an upvote.
Big blue circle jerk?  Pardon? Can you address the contents of the article, please: That Michele Bachmann and Thaddeus McCotter voted against spending cuts, but Ron Paul did not?
What's there to discuss? Republicans are hypocrites, this article exposes nothing new.
sensationalized title?? THATS EXACTLY WHATS GOING ON YOU RETARD!
I actally agree with you on that.
at least ron can be reasoned with.
Passing a bar exam isn't evidence of intelligence. You can take a prep course without a law degree and probably pass the thing.
For starters, she thinks you can "pray the gay away", which flies in the face of every single piece of evidence put forth by anyone with more evidence than a bible.

She believes evolution is a myth. This is enough to prove she's a moron.

She has stated that CO2 is "not a harmful gas".

She thinks eliminating the minimum wage would eliminate unemployment.
well of course BECAUSE IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL  HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO GO OVER THIS... MY GOSH SOME OF YOU LIBERALS DONT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT HAVING YOUR RIGHTS STRIPED AWAY 
you are a sad pathetic little man. Im gonna cry because the big money making machine is out to get me. 

Wowza, get the fuck over yourself.
1) Who says that prayer doesn't help the "gay urge"?  I think you presume too much based upon limited evidence. Religious experience and prayer help with a lot of conditions, and have for thousands of years.
2) Many intelligent thoughtful people think that evolution is a myth; as well as many intelligent, thoughtful people think that creationism is a myth.  If you're using evolution as a precursor to a presidential candidate then your priorities are a little off.
3) C02 is not a harmful gas.  Check with any plant.
4) Show support for this statement, first off. Secondly, this argument has been put forth by plenty of intelligent free market capitalists, including Milton Friedman.  Than Bachmann believes likewise doesn't really mean much unless you think that others that have made the argument in the past are full of shit. 
Probably? Have you ever tried?
1) That's absurd. Provide evidence of prayer doing anything more than providing a placebo effect. Further, virtually all mainstream health organizations are extremely critical of conversion therapy include the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of School Psychologists, etc. etc. etc. Pray in one hand, shit in the other. See which fills up first.

2) No intelligent person thinks evolution is a myth. Show me a person who believes in creationism and I'll show you a moron.

3) Holy crap. You have to be trolling me. First, you typed C02, so I'm not sure if you even know what it is. CO2, by and of itself is dangerous when taken in toxic amounts. But Bachmann said "it's not dangerous" to imply that it's **never** dangerous. In fact, it is. It's a greenhouse gas. Global climate change does exist. Unlike what Ms. Bachmann believes in, there are observable facts and evidence to prove its existence. CO2 kills creatures that depend on oxygen for respiration. And it is has harmful effects on plants saturated in it. I will cite my wife, a PhD in Horticulture as a source on this. I don't care enough to search for it. But I will leave [this.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO%E2%82%82_retention)

4) Why should we follow the ideas of free market capitalists? Because they have the nation's best interests at heart? By definition, their only concern is that which will better the goals of the capital, the company, the shareholder, etc. It's a patently absurd argument to make. It presupposes  that lowering the minimum wage will allow companies to hire people for any price. Let's say, $1 an hour for everyone. Can anyone live on $1 an hour? NO! So lowering the minimum wage will do nothing. Companies will raise the wage to the lowest possible level that people will accept. I guarantee you that that wage is certainly not much less than $7.25 an hour. 

Further, the minimum wage is an anti-poverty device meant to protect the poorest from the richest. Do you deny that poverty increases crime and other negative social effects? There's an unequal distribution of wealth in this country. That's a simple fact. The law simply doesn't allow companies to force the most destitute to be even more destitute. 

Let's discuss the negatives of the minimum wage. It decreases the profits of corporations... MCD had profits of 2.6 billion last quarter... I think minimum wage may have forced that down from 2.61.  What a shame that all those poor people working there took away all that money from the MCD shareholders.

Hey, don't worry - We're in agreement. I'll vote for Crazy Michelle. I want her to win the Republican nomination because she has absolutely no chance of winning a general election!
Yes. And I have passed it. That being said, I went to law school, so I don't count for that sample. I should rephrase... "If you could take a prep course without a law degree and then take the bar exam, you'd probably pass it"

There have been others that did it. I know someone else here mentioned Frank Abagnale. The fact is that the State Bar exam, in most states, is geared towards ensuring that the lawyers are competent in most areas of the law. I can tell you that as a fact, most lawyers are not competent in most areas of the law. They specialize. I work in Estates and Wealth Planning. Why should I need to know anything about Criminal Law? A bar prep course merely teaches you enough to pass the test. It is designed to help you pass even if you have NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE of the law. And the law is different in every state. So there are prep courses in every state. And Bar exams in every state. 

Passing one is not evidence of intelligence. It is evidence of being able to pass a bar exam. And in light of the fact that the lady denies evolution and thinks you can pray away being gay, I think she's either a liar or a moron. I'm going to go with liar. She is, after all, a politician.
Why are you so angry that I feel this way? Do you like being taken advantage of? Do you like an unsustainable energy policy? The "big money making machine" can do what it wants, I guess, but did they deserve you're money after they fucked up? This puzzles me. Why are you so adamant about defending the aristocracy when they have done nothing for you? Is it just that you hate people with my kind of ideology more?
"debate"
I think Michele Bachmann is the antichrist
Holy shit one of THOSE people! Never seen one in real life
 /poke
It seems to me, just from observation, in countries with little to no regulation (most of the third world) the big corporations are far worse. They totally trample the small businesses and monopolize most industries. While at the same time completely ignoring human rights and the environment. I agree that there are lots of regulations that prevent start-ups and small businesses from competing with big business, but thinking eliminating regulation will fix the problem is ignorant. Industry needs regulation, it just needs regulation that isn't heavily influenced by big business.
Lutherans hate Catholics.  News at 11.
Gary Johnson, FTW. Guy's some sort of an ancient republican travelled through time to make the future a better place.
because your statements are not only false and crazy, but it sounds like you want everything to be handed to you without doing any work.

You see, what I find dangerous here, in your line of thinking, is that you assume that I'm automatically lazy. I love to work. I'm going to school to be a historian. I live to do research and to educate. I do Habit for Humanity and am constantly collaborating with my circle on various projects. I also have a shit job that pays my bills, and I could engage in more worth-while contributions if I weren't doing what I do there, which is ultimately useless, 40 hours a week. In the big picture, I don't want anybodies money. I want us to cease using it all together, build a sustainable society in which everyone is able to eat and shelter themselves, and spend my time more constructively - learning, growing, creating, innovating, reading, *living* for Christ's sake. If you think this is the best system for that, and I'm not trying to attack you, you've got to look around and get the idea out of your head that people are motivated by profit only and that this "economy," as we call it, is just evolved indentured servitude. Watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxe7tlr-2I4), if you care too. It might just open you up a bit.  
This woman is bat shit crazy
I am a registered democrat but that does not mean i will vote that way. I have looked into Gary Johnson.  He seems pretty reasonable even though i disagree with him on certain things regarding economic policy but he seems like a sound candidate.  Unfortunately he was snubbed from the republican debate to make room for the bat shit insane Bachmann.  I'm afraid he won't do too well because he doesn't appeal to crazy moral conservatives who care about gay marriage, legalizing weed, and other shit like that 
The christian right will be the end of this country.  Its unfortunate that a candidate must sell out to the religious crazies in order to get support from the right and during that process they become crazy themselves even though they started out promossingly.
this will never get old
Just because someone isn't a right winger doesnt make them socialist.  Some of us are moderates
Well since huge companies like G.E. payed %0 on their 3 billion profit, yes i would like to raise that 0 to about 8 or 9. The corporate tax rate is about 35 (correct me if im wrong) this is what small businesses pay.  How about we have all corporations pay 8 or 9 without loopholes or deductions for bullshit and the difference that would make. 9% is a reasonable rate that will be a an incentive for people to start businesses here and at the same time the gov. would generate loads in tax revenue if companies like G.E. actually payed their taxes even at a low rate.  9% of 3 billion is 270,000,000 which is much better than the 0 the gov received from GE but not to high as to drive away corporations 
I agree I've read all of your comments carefully and found them very intelligent and interesting.  The reason people are upset with you is that you come off as socialist to them which fox news told them was a bad things.  I believe we should do what ever benefits the most people as apposed to the selfish and destructive individuals.  But at the same time i enjoy my freedoms and all the goods and services i consume which at times may seem selfish. Which leaves it up to us as consumers to call upon producers to make products that benefit society as a whole
well... she is a heretic, so nothing new there
Are you asking what religion someone is not?
I'm more of a fiscal republican. I'm also an atheist.
under that philosophy you could end up in jail just for posting in this thread
Frank Abagnale passed the bar at a time when the requirements were much less stringient, to begin with. Secondly, law has come a long way since then.  I used to work in the 2nd largest lawfirm in the state of Idaho (In advance, please refrain from the "country bumpkin" arguments). The senior partner passed the Idaho bar AND the California bar exams by simply studying the pertinent texts by himself.  In that decade (Mid to late 60s) it was still quite a feat. Rarely can that sort of thing be done today - or even within the last 20 years.  Point being, it takes a person of resolve, intelligence, and dedication to pass the bar.  To simply discount Bachmann on this basis shows your bias against her as a competant candidate.  Furthermore, that you base her intelligence/competance on her faith and personal beliefs, rather than her ability to administrate and lead, indicates the superficial criteria with which you determine a likely candidate for the Republican nomination.
1) First, don't underestimate the effectiveness of placebo.  The APA has rarely, if ever, acknowledged the effectiveness of 12-Step programs, but it has proven effective for alcoholics, addicts and for various behavioral abberations for more than 60 years. As well, placebo is effective for physical maladies, and is used in accupuncture and chiropractic respectively.

2) Really? So considering the subject of this discussion, Washington, Andrew Jackson, Lincoln, Johnson, Roosevelt, and even John F. Kennedy (a highly religious Roman Catholic) were all morons. Is that what you intend to argue?

3) You'll cite YOUR WIFE? AND you'll cite Wikipedia?  The term "greenhouse gasses" didn't exist prior to the AGW argument, and I would argue prior to the propaganda.  Before that, CO2 (Carbon dioxide) was simply an innocuous gas that humans breath out and cows fart.  Simply, AGW is complte bullshit. It's unproven, unsettled, and largely overblown.

4)    "...the minimum wage is an anti-poverty device meant to protect the poorest from the richest." 

I'll stop you right there, because that's simply a presupposition. It's bullshit, because even at $7.25 full-time a person is short of the national poverty level by about $15k.  So it really protects nobody. Minimum wage simply sets a standard for unskilled labor, providing little to no incentive for advancement.  Furthermore it gives more power to labor unions who have cornered much of the labor market in manufacturing and the service industries. Who lives on minimum wage?  Part-time high school students living at home and persons supplementing their income with some form of state or Federal assistance.  

The free market naturally provides incentive for persons living below the poverty line to develop skills worthy of just compensation. It eliminates the need for a standard "starting wage," because increasingly unskilled labor is eliminated from the market. Few people, if any, are willing to work for $1 and hour. If they only qualify for those jobs then naturally they will either seek higher paying jobs with the same skill sets, or they will seek training for highewr wages. There is no competition for miniumum wage jobs. Any moron can get one.  When you eliminate the factor of competition, everyone loses.
Mitt Romney wears magic underwear.
Tampa? Looks like i know when i'm taking my vacation out of state..
All the way to the WH.
Having the lead this early doesn't mean anything. Guliani proved that. Even if he does get the nomination, him calling the WH home is not a foregone conclusion. Either way, it was a pretty funny comeback. You're not usually that sharp of a whit, Nolibs. Not bad.
Perplexing that an admitted Democrat would vote for a man who wants to burn the social safety net.
Just plain confusing to me.
Former chuch aint it?  

I think she's a bucket full of crazy, but wasn't Obama's pastor also a crazy person?  
I made it 40 seconds.  Can anyone beat that?
Really?  Ron Paul can be reasoned with?  When has he ever reconsidered one of his views and changed it?  I'll go with "never."

Extremists don't reconsider, nor reason.
ooooooooooook ron paul is an extremist?
god youre an idiot.
Okay, give an example where he's reconsidered a position or found a compromise.
OH NOES!!!! HES AN EXTREMIST BECAUSE HE DOESNT BELIEVE THE WAY I WANT HIM TO! 
seriously, your argument is just "me,me,me,me,me,me."
Its not even a question relevant to your previous statment.
once again, youre an idiot.
Not saying I would necessarily vote for him but in my opinion, I like him the most out of all the gop candidates 
Non-extremists find middle ground.  Just give me one single example where Ron Paul has found middle ground and compromised on something.

Just one.  
who cares! honestly, your question is an example of a logical fallacy. It seems that you just want congressmen to be nothing but a bunch of flip floppers. No one can have a "Hey I belive in *insert cause here* and thats that."
You aren't big on the whole logic thing are you?
So he's not an extremist but you can't think of a single thing he's ever compromised about.  

By your definition, moderates are "flip-floppers" because they find a middle ground.

Which, if you think about it for two seconds, reveals you as an extremist.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I DONT WANNA BE DE EXTWEEMIST! OHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

goddamn you are fucking retarded. please fuck off.
Well, you are.  And you've buried yourself in this thread.

Have a good day.
oh p-p-p-p-please don't lable me an extremist! I might not get invited to the next balls in mouth party...I mean obama for prez 2012 party.
and that would just crush me.
Ron Paul is far right.  He has the [most conservative voting record](http://voteview.com/Is_John_Kerry_A_Liberal.htm) of any congressman since 1937.  

Herman Cain believes that citizens should be allowed to stop Muslims from building mosques in their community because Islam is more than a religion, it includes sharia law and is a threat to our society.  He, beyond being a complete idiot, also hasn't read the first amendment.  I can't imagine him as president because of this blind stupidity. 
Michele Bachmann isn't smart enough to be president.  She thought that the founding fathers worked tirelessly to end slavery.  This, besides being completely inaccurate and stupid, proves that she is a bull shit artist.  A statement like that is made to associate oneself with an idealistic group of people, but she just doesn't know when to draw the line and probably would have gotten away with this (and will get away with more dumb blanket statements) if it wasn't so obvious that she was wrong.  

Bottom line is, I want someone who is honest, concerned with the issues and outcomes, not with making me *feel* good during a speech.  Obama made people feel great, but was completely lying or is very weak as a leader.  Bachmann will do this for another set of people, but her stupidity and lack of experience (as well as her stint at the IRS) will ruin her. 
Politicians as bullshit artists?  Really?  Well that just destroys all of my confidence in the political process.

Thank you. Thank you for setting me straight. I would otherwise  have never known that politicians are really full of shit.
That is the interesting thing about Mormons. Their religion is always one of the main adjectives used to describe them. If a Mormon comes under the public eye it is very typical to see the media mention his/her religion when they would not otherwise do so. I thought that the article made an interesting parallel to jfk
Yep, she's since left this church.   And heck, Rev. Wright was worse than her church.  That man is a racist.
I know, right? If someone questioned a candidate for being Jewish, Muslim, or Catholic we would throw a big stink and call them a bigot.
They voted against it because it didn't go far enough.
Most people don't know he has ran his state into the ground with Debt.

Nearly eclipsing Cali.

So much for that republican touch.
Obama at least retained his rationality. Bachmann is a certifiable crazy.
Cain rising
&gt;For my part as an American, I would rather have a devotedly religious person in the White House. Whether the next President is of my faith or not, I would personally take comfort knowing that the President believes in a responsibility to something that transcends this life and inspires a greater sense of duty than someone who is afraid to admit such things are true. I would feel safer each day knowing the basic tenets of my President and that the President’s behavior and decisions would embrace a certain level of inspired predictability. I would prefer to give my vote to a person who can say, like President Kennedy

Is it completely inconceivable to have a leader with mild or no religious affiliation and still have a good moral compass? Does a President (or anyone) need an ancient book to tell him to how not to be a douche? Are we that simple? 

Reminds me of the time my dad was recalling one of his favorite Christian stories where he felt it was "the Christian thing to do" to spend some time with a recently widowed neighbor to try and cheer her up. I asked, "why does it have to be a Christian thing, why couldn't you just do it because its the right thing to do, and you're a nice guy?"
I came here looking for intelligent conversation and maybe some answers as to why Republicans are bringing nothing to the table in Congress.  It appears that Republicans here are also content just avoiding the conversation.
If Republicans are content with avoiding everything, then why is the budget waiting on Democrats in the Senate?  

The bigger problem is that Washington is addicted to spending.  Government has gotten too big, and it needs to live within it's means.  

It's the issue of we'd like to get what we pay for (value for our taxes) vs. We'd like someone else to pay for it.  

Most of us are on the side of lets not waste money.  No one really says "as efficient as the DMV" in a positive light.  Cut the waste out of the government, and then the argument is a matter of us needing more revenue.

Isn't that emotion fighting against the fact that our constitution demands separation of church and state?

Still, bringing up that our childrens education affects their voting is worthwhile to read every few years.
Well... the waste is impossible to get rid of, both economically and 
politically.

 Economically, there is too high of an expectation in the infallibility of government records to slack off, and a lack of competitive services reduces motivation to make the process more efficient. If any employee saw a mistake to be fixed, he might just give up in frustration with trying to find the right person to contact, and then THAT person might just be lazy.

Politically, any streamlining will be seen by the opposing party as "job-killing", even though the jobs weren't needed.  

Not all of it no, but c'mon, how about the big stuff?  
I totally agree with you.  The government needs to close its over 9000 all too open hands and slow the cash flow.  I also feel that we need to start minding our own business.  We shouldn't be responsible for helping every country that faces a crisis.  I'm not saying we should be assholes, but Washington said we should stay out of foreign affairs and he was totally right.  
Zirbs, either you agree or disagree.  If you cannot see the historical relevance of constantly compromising our positions, then you must not care.  It’s really simple, example, when it comes to spending, the Republicans are no different from Democrats, only the programs are different.  A debt ceiling is a debt ceiling we greatly contributed to.  
Or, you are left of center and there is no check book big enough…

Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Obama bring a budget to the table that reduced spending by nearly 4 trillion while increasing revenue WITHOUT raising taxes and Boehner walked away from the meeting in which it was being discussed?
Do we *need* money. Abolishing the monetary system and taking control over our own resources sounds like the best action plan to me.
I think he didn't want to be trounced by snarling atheists. If you don't include that caveat nonbelievers will be stupid enough to think the poster thinks *everyone* has a religion. 


EDIT: oh yeah, and I'm atheist, but not a Republican either so you probably don't care. 
Nobody is interested in your bullshit Huffington Post articles in /r/republicans, bro.

That's your state you're screwing bro.

Yeah, it was waaaaay easier to engage in trade before money.
A monetary system is equivalent to trading in my book. Whether its legal tender or chickens its all the same. I'm ready to eschew that entire ideological construct. I'm just waiting on everyone else. Check [it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxe7tlr-2I4) out.
Please don't be a link to Zeitgeist or Equal Money...
Darn it... Venus Project. X_X  In fairness, continuing to reduce scarcity through technological advancement is great. I just don't have much stomach for Marxism + robots.
Gotcha! Those films are too crass and presumptive, I think. I like to show people *Future by Design* because its straightforward and makes one ponder instead of the jarring attack on their ideology. 

I'm sorry these ideas don't resonate with you. With all due respect, however, I think they deserve a little more credence than you give them. First of all, you'd better buckle up if you weren't expecting robots to be an intricate part of your life as I'm assuming you have most of yours left. Automation and robotics are already an intricate part of your life and will continue to steadily become an overt aspect of the world no mater what path (as long as there is continued advancement) we end up on.

Secondly, I would hesitate to label anyone who advocates a Resource Based Economy as a Marxist. While economics was a central theme of Marx's work, it became more so toward the end of his career. Prior to that he was trying to determine how society's shift from one epoch to another. Finally, it was his understanding that epochal shift occurs due to class struggle, and that a lower class would always usurp its master. In this way RBE advocates are Marxist in the sense that their success would offer further proof to Marx's theory. But, I would say, a transition to a Resource Based Economy would be a complete rejection of monetary/ownership economics. I'm talking about a global ideological shift. A brand new and more civilized Age. I'm sorry if you have a weak stomach, but that thought of it all excites the hell out of me.

Most I could come up with for Obama bringing up budget ideas.  But I'd like to see where you got that from, I haven't seen anything to that effect.  

I don't think Obama has ever had a budget idea that didn't involve raising taxes.  He just started referring to it as "new revenues" instead of "new taxes".  
Serious question, why are you a Republican?
I wanna say sorry if I was inflammatory at all. You seem like a really solid, respectful poster.

Anyway, I'm totally fine with robots. Bring it on! I just feel that market economies already move in this direction of reducing scarcity and increasing the standard of living. Yes, there are tons of political challenges, evil people, human rights issues, etc., but look at how much progress has been made since the industrial revolution. I'm glad there are creative people thinking about moving forward even faster though. 

I said "Marxism" because, from the sounds of it, the idea is the abolition of private property by making everything a non-economic good. (Money obviously becomes obsolete at that point.) Everything will be so abundant that there will be no point in selling or trading. I can imagine this post-scarcity scenario in a way, but time will still be a scarce resource, and there will still be opportunity costs.
fuck republicans
Seriously? You actually put effort into trolling a group of what, 300 people? 

Edit: Besides, this is the best rant you came up with? I see better shit on r/politics when I accidentally click on the wrong link. You get an A for effort but an F for trolling. 
Well, since the antichrist in the Bible is not a person but a group of people, they're wrong unless the Pope is a gremlin and someone feeds him after midnight.
You're right. 
No worries, my friend. If I got heated every time someone made a snarky remark about something *I* brought up it'd make me a pretty shitty person. Not to mention a horrible advocate for an ideological transition. 

At a cursory glance it seems to me like you have a pretty good grasp on the technical aspects of a Resource Based Economy. I'd pursue more information. Perhaps you'd be more supportive if some of the lingering questions and dreads you have were seen from a difference perspective. r/TZM might be a good place to start looking for interesting outlooks. If you ever feel like discussing anything feel free to write me a message. 

Oh yeah...I totally agree with you, by the way, about the rate of progress since the Industrial Revolution, but I say let's go crazy. Perhaps a form of Resource based Economy is the inevitable end-result of a market economy. If you trickle down long enough eventually you will fill the glass, right? In other words, a slave society would never have obtained a free market system if it weren't for the opressive (by our standards) mecantile system that existed in between. The current system may just be a necessary step in the process of a society becoming civilized. Thoughts?


I came here for the exact same reason and only found your post... I'm really disappointed. I really want to understand how someone can be against raising taxes on millionaires, which would be along with (not instead of) severe cuts to social programs, and insist on only the cuts to programs. It makes no sense to me, but it clearly makes sense to a lot of other people. Is reddit the wrong place to find republicans?
What debt crisis? Where we are is where we intended to be, that you didn't know does not make this a crisis. There is no crisis.

&gt; I really want to understand how someone can be against raising taxes on millionaires

Simple, I don't hate them. Sorry, couldn't resist.
That's what Obama said.  Boehner said that they when he agreed to a deal with Obama, the president then turned around and changed his mind, asking for more, so Boehner said no.  I honestly don't know who to believe.
Where does it say that the Republicans are screwing the states?  I only see it saying that the lack of compromise can screw them, which from what I've heard, it's been both sides being reluctant.
Wow.  And in other news, people in New York like the Yankees.  Really, Ron Paul is waning, and does America really want to suffer under another Republican governor from Texas?
I don't hate millionaires. I invest and participate in the free market, and I'm not exactly a millionaire (..yet ;), but am well aware that the more money you have the more money you can make. A progressive tax is reasonable for people to support a system which allows them the stability and opportunity to take advantage of that fact. Taxing the extremely wealthy isn't intended to drive them into poverty, and it shouldn't reduce their ability or desire to create jobs. 
Because people will still be paying taxes, so the government will still have income.  They're just going to have to spend a little less.  
I think the idea is that the US isn't going to implode when the clock strikes midnight on august 2.  The effect of defaulting is going to come quickly, but he was probably trying to bank on the fact that there is a slight cushion before the true impact of such a situation would be felt.

But the thing about that is that not only would it obviously raise the pressure to come up with a plan quick, but the political ramifications for, at this point, the Republican party (although you know both sides will try and spin it against the other) would be far worse, so I really doubt they'll let it get to that point.
So, he was misinformed by stating that the government will not run out of money?  I was unsure if there was talk by some that this was all faked and the government will not run out of money or something...

I fully understand that it is not that the on the stroke of midnight everything crashes and burns, but again this guy was literally saying that the government has enough money to pay for everything and will not run out of money without increasing the debt ceiling.  What irks me more than this blatant misinformation he has accrued somehow, is that he was telling someone else this, that other person believed him and I should have stepped in...
religion is a bunch of bullshit. everyone wants to be fed an answer to life because they are too lazy to go out and find it themselves....electing a devotee of a religion leading our country is the worst thing we can do...
I'm an agnostic. And I'm also not a republican either. I tend to be moderate, simply because of my lack of caring about politics. 
bachmann is a fucking idiot. a complete reason of why religion is just used to control mindless people. and sadly its working.
Watching Al Sharpton try to form words is like rubbing my dick in broken glass.


Will the Feds stop collecting taxes on Aug 2nd? If not, then they still should be able to fund almost everything they do now. Since the Feds run such high defecits, they will have to stop some things or sell assets to make ends meet. I for one wouldn't mind them dumping almost all of the land they own. Much of it is idle.
The government still has money coming in to pay for Social Security, Medicare, Military, and a few other programs.  This is based on the apparent fact that Billions of dollars are still coming into the government.  Overall, it is like saying we can pay off about 50-75% of what the government has promised out.  This might be a true fact; however, it is like saying a band-aid will keep you from bleeding out.  Overall, this is looking bad for everyone involved.        
Basing our presidency on personal feelings on something unrelated to the job instead of on their actual political views is actually the worst thing we could do.  If their religion affects their views, then base the opinion on those views.
They're already running at a deficit INCLUSIVE of profits from taxes. The taxes are already part of the equation, they're not something you can add in and say "hey, look there's some extra money we haven't used yet, we can use that!". Taxes and other revenue streams, afaik, do NOT account for the expenses the they're incurring.

Do they have an "income"? Yes. Do they have any sort of net profit from which to spend? No.
Profit?  They have to invest or work to have "profit". 
I've never heard of that definition, personally.

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/profit

And neither of those mentions a necessity for investment or work.
Why does this matter if the vast majority of her opponents do not believe in the Christ? Oh, and is our current President's pastor of more than 20 years not a blatant racist? (Yes, that is a rhetorical question.)
Johnson.  Gary Johnson.
: a valuable return - eg, putting something in first?
: the excess of returns over expenditure in a transaction or series of transactions; especially : the excess of the selling price of goods over their cost - eg expenditure?
: net income usually for a given period of time - Net, not gross
: the ratio of profit for a given year to the amount of capital invested or to the value of sales - actually uses the word "invested"
: the compensation accruing to entrepreneurs for the assumption of risk in business enterprise as distinguished from wages or rent - Compensation, in exchange for work.  

What definition were you using?
I believe the "new revenues" was from closing tax loopholes, not from actually raising tax rates (although they are essentially the same thing)
So he's more like Lincoln, who would be labeled a democrat today?
Ron Paul seems to have popular fiscal policies, but I am not a fan of the "We The People Act" he proposed. It seems to serve to undermine the Federal Judiciary completely. Not something I'd say is a good indication of someone thought to be a champion of the Constitution.
All I know is the rent is too damn high!
Money will still come in, but we will can only cover 60% of our bills.  So we have to decide who does not get paid out of the 80 million checks that the government writes per month.
40% less.  That is a lot.

I thought so. I thought about posting it to /r/politics but I have not had much success in there with comments, not sure how a submission would be received.

They'd ignore it.  What you can't argue, you ignore.  
Thanks for for the input faggot. Now that I'm on your level of maturity, do you dispute the fact that the tea party has created a discernible divide within the republican party that may undermine their chances of removing BO from office in 2012? This is a subjective topic, in case you didn't realize. 
[deleted]
I cannot agree that Democrats in the Senate were the obstacle here.  Obama, against his party's will, was going to accept large cuts to social programs early on.  However, as soon as he mentioned any revenue increases the deal was off.  The key to a compromise is that both sides give up something.  Obama was willing to lobby for cuts so long as revenue was increased ( marginally and at the expense of the rich mind you).  Republicans' idea of a compromise in this situation was cutting less that they wanted to...which is to be honest a joke.

Imagine this scenario reversed with Democrats demanding a revenue increase.  The Republican president concedes so long as spending cuts are made, only to be met with "no spending cuts will be tolerated, however, we will meet you in the middle by raising taxes less than we originally intended".
I'll bite.  I generally avoid spouting my conservative views on reddit, but you seem like a nice guy. I don't consider myself a Republican, namely because republicans don't follow their own soapbox promises and there's nothing I hate more than hypocrites.  That said, I feel like my libertarian views and numerous republican relatives give me a pretty good perspective to answer your question.

I don't actually think educated conservatives have a problem with higher taxes.  They have a problem with the programs the higher taxes are being spent _on_.  They have a problem with going further into debt to fund programs that (in their mind) are frivolous.  The issue isn't taxes.  It's about debt and government control over personal life. 

We don't like to spend more than we are earning, on a personal or national level.  I'm graduating college soon, and I will do so with absolutely no debt.  It hasn't been easy and I have had to make major sacrifices, but I believe it will be worth it. It's not just a personal thing, and I feel our country should be held to the same standard.  

There's always this: http://www.usdebtclock.org/  The current state of our deficit and the recent house proposal have brought this even more to light.  I always have wondered how many politicians are in debt.  We may raise taxes to pay for part of a program, but then we print more money and borrow from China to pay for the rest of it.  Again, the problem isn't the taxes, its the inflated money and debt that is happening behind the scenes.

Many Republicans don't agree with what the taxes are being raised _for_.  I think oftentimes the "don't raise taxes" stubpoint is just a way to disagree with something without actually addressing the issue. Honestly, this annoys me as I am sure it annoys you.  If I am going to disagree with universal healthcare (or whatever) I will give you constructive arguments so we can rationally discuss the cons and pros.  Not some stubpoint bullshit.

Anyways, feel free to ask me anything else.

&gt; deficit

Which was the last administration to have a surplus?
Thanks for your response!  Nothing to bite on, no tricks, I think that people who disagree need to talk more often so they can see the full spectrum of the problem that is our government.

I understand what you're saying.  To be honest I am in favor of reigning in Federal spending as well.  We cannot afford to blow money, and I think that *only* increasing revenue and *only* cutting spending are two equally poor plans.  To recover we need to do both.

As for the taxes are being spent on: Republicans seem to be fine with spending loads of money on defense  and other expenditures they deem important, but as soon as a social program or education comes along its a labeled as "massive federal spending".  I know that the government can't pay for everything, but I just don't see the logic in spending so much on the military, which is already superior on a world scale, and not investing  any government money in making sure that the populace receives medical care and that schools have enough funding to educate American youth.

I'm even willing to admit that our country is not ready for universal healthcare (a big step for a leftist, lol), but education and awareness are two things that a ridiculously large portion of the population lack.  I'm graduating in 2 years myself, and to be honest, its alarming how many people in my University have no idea how the government works let alone what issues *they* have to vote on to solve major problems.

Hell, I'd rather there be an overwhelmingly conservative majority who's well informed and invested in the future of the country rather than the current state of apathy.  I think that an improved and re-constructed education system is the only way to this in the future.

What are your thoughts about the budget? Where do you think cuts should be made and why?  I'm interested in getting people to lay their cards on the table here.
We all know it was Clinton, but riddle me this batman, how is it that Democrats can't pass anything in Congress even when they have the majority in both houses pre-dating the 2010 midterms?

It seems that all the Republicans need is a majority in the House and even a Democratic Senate and Presidency cannot stop their agenda from being performed.

Makes us Dems look pretty shitty, and I don't really feel like hearing about it from everyone that will respond if people post abrasive things like this.

If you have something constructive to say, please feel free to converse, but if you're just going to mention Democratic victories that *already happened* rather than discuss points on how to fix things that are *currently* happening, I'll ask you to please keep it to yourself.

No ones going to listen to you with you're ass that high up on your shoulder.
"I'd rather there be an overwhelmingly conservative majority who's well informed and invested in the future of the country rather than the current state of apathy."

I completely agree. ;)  Seriously though, I would rather well informed socialists than uninformed people who share my beliefs. 

I think the reason many republicans are ok with spending funding on defense is that they see it as necessary.  I definitely don't line up with the republican party on war issues, my libertarian views are very non-interventionist. 

To answer you final questions, I think the big national priority should be decreasing the deficit and at the VERY least we need to be spending less than we are taking in.  If it were my decision I would privative virtually all the government programs over a long time period, and the only thing that would remain would be "fairness" regulatory governing bodies. (If you want my reasons I can give them, but its a major sidetrack) I know that will never happen, so the next best thing would be cutting frivolous programs within the departments. 

I think one organization liberals and conservatives should join together behind is http://www.cagw.org/


Agreed.  People need to learn to not attack, and no be defensive.  Just listen and learn from one another.
It's because the Dems are less of a centrally controlled hivemind, which is what the Republicans are now. If you don't toe the party line, you're screwed; look at McCain speaking out against the Tea Party. He's fucked now.

The first thing we need to do is raise the age for collecting social security to 75. Then we need to put a net-worth limit on people collecting it. In other words, millionaires shouldn't be collecting social-security.  
  
After that, I would:  
*Repeal Obamacare  
*Lower the Capital Gains tax  
*Eliminate income tax on people making under $500,000 annually, and institute a national sales tax. (This would bring in a lot of money that is currently off the books, like drug money.)  
*10% cuts across the board on social programs.  
*Get out of Afghanistan.  
  
Those were supposed to be bullets. Whatever.
I like how you think.  I did debate years ago in high school and even then the best case I ran was a national sales tax case.  The great thing is, you can exempt food and make it non-existent for people bellow the poverty line.
The only hole in the [Fair Tax](http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer) is that the very rich tend to only spend a small percentage of their annual income, whereas everybody else tends to spend almost %100 of it. However if we institute the national sales tax, while still retaining the traditional income tax on the rich (at a much lower rate to account for the higher sales taxes they'll be paying too) we can fix that flaw.  
  
And you're right, it's great because you can lower or even eliminate taxes on basic necessities (like food, gasoline, etc.). Likewise, we could put premium tax rates on luxury goods like yachts and jewelry.
No need to get so hostile retard
If we cut the waste, we don't need to raise taxes.  

People don't want to raise taxes for waste.  Folks just want to get their money's worth.  
The elementary theory: the lower taxes are, the less money is taken away from a business's gross income, and the higher the business's profit is. This allows the business to expand/pay out more, stimulating the economy.
Have you seen what the government does with my money?  I don't mind paying taxes, it's just that I really hate not getting my money's worth.  
Government spends too much, and liberals don't police their own programs.  Raising taxes is not the best solution for this lack of oversight.

Aside from that, liberals always want to raise taxes in a way that picks winners and losers.  I don't agree with institutionalized sicrimination in any form.  I believe in a government who treats all individuals equally regardless of age, race, sexual preferences, and yes, even income.

Agreed, and the loopholes that allow illegal immigrants, tax evaders, and the like would be filled.
Although I think you were attempting to explain, all you did was say "liberals do this and liberals do that".  How about some specifics please.

(I'm trying to keep the OP's tone in polite conversation as opposed to partisan bickering)
It seems that this doesn't work though. Taxes are their lowest in 60 years.
So would you accept higher taxes if you had as effective as Norway, Sweden or Switzerland?
Sure.  There's a lot of folks already paying 40% in taxes or higher, and healthcare is nowhere near close to getting healthcare (not just insurance) paid for.  
for the sake of this discussion, I think I'd rather generalize.  I started out a liberal myself, so I don't find the word to be a bad word. 
Ok, but we need more government revenue. Cutting spending is important. Military is the best way to start, but you need more revenue AND less spending to really achieve anything.
In this way, the Republicans are actually pushing America towards a system more similar to the Westminster model, even despite the claims about how different and better the United States is supposed to be.
No we dont.  We need less government "revenue." We need more small business revenue.  We need less money in the hands of government and more money in the hands of the people.

This, of course, isn't the society we live in.  Instead, we live in a society where government has created corporations that socialize the risk of doing business on to the people, and these private/public entities leech on society through corporate welfare that they need in order to survive because of how twisted government has made the incentive structure in this nation, and how many jobs are at stake.

Through this whole "debt ceiling" ordeal, I just laughed .  The left Nd right have been pulling the blocks out of this jenga stack since Woodrow Wilson took us into the first world war, and when the tea party draws a line before the last Jenga block is pulled, everyone acts like we're the ones pulling it.

"Ok, we'll let you immorally spend more of unborn Americans money and effectively tax them without representation, but we insist that a plan be put in place so that we can pay as we go and  preserve some semblance of a nation for them...  Ok?". 

"You MONSTERS!"
What I'm confused about is conservatives want to have less spending, they don't want to cut defense.

they want less taxes, but still want to continue the wars.(how will you pay for the bullets, people, vehicles, if you refuse to be taxed to pay for what you want)

as a sign said  "don't cut defense, cut taxes" but you can't pay for defense without taxes.
Rephrase the question:

Why are Republicans so vehemently opposed to bringing tax rates back to the levels they were?  Clinton put us on track to pay off our debt, and Bush decided that money would be better spent letting corporate fat cats line their pockets even further.
[deleted]
I'm with you on the putting a net-worth limit on social security for sure, but I think raising the age to 75 would be strapping a lot of people.  I'm from Philadelphia, and a lot of lower income people living in the city have to work well into their 70's as it is to keep paying rent and put food on the table.  Even though its not a lot, its an important peice of their income.

To be honest, I don't like Obamacare either, however I'd want to completely socialize the healthcare system.  That being said, if the government were to cut or eliminate taxes below a certain income line, it would make up for, at least in some respect, a lack of healthcare and social programs.  I think that some sort of compromise, while not wowing the public, would at least get a nod of logical approval.

The key issue, in my opinion, is that if taxes and social programs are going to be cut, the tax cuts need to match the social program cuts, and for that matter *absolutely* need to match people's income levels.  In middle class/upper class America, a decent number of people get healthcare from their employers, but in the lower-middle and lower classes a good public option should be present in my opinion.

In my opinion, my main beef with tax cuts is that they always favor high income individuals, and go hand in hand with measures to screw over lower income individuals.  If taxes are to be cut, it should be to help the people who need help.

Thanks for your comment!
I think it would be nice to restructure the tax system as it was then.  I honestly don't know about the history of taxes in America a great deal, but if anything would get bi-partisan support (at least with the voters, maybe not politicians) it would be to fuel our government with income from large corporations and take the burden off of the people.
much appreciated!
I think this is a really revealing stance.  If we Democrats/Progressives want to raise taxes, it is of the upmost importance that they are used responsibly.  A good policing system is in order for sure.  To be honest I never really though of it in terms of where tax money goes once it is taxed.  I think the main thing that both sides of the economic debate have to address is that the government's money has to be prioritized and monitored carefully.
I think that if the government were to treat everyone as if they are equal it would be a lie.  People in our country aren't equal, they have the same basic human rights, but they are by no means equal.  This can be seen from the income gap that is currently widening.


You're right, the political parties in this country do not communicate very well.  However, pointing this out in anger is not going to help the problem, its just going to allow it to gain roots.

I understand the basic tennants of the Tea Party wanting money in the hands of the people.  Their platform isn't what bothers me.  Personally, what bothers me is the hooting and hollaring from both the supporters and leaders of their movement.  

If the Tea Party had formed when Clinton was in office I would understand, but it was too much and too late.  Where was the Tea Party when Ron Paul was running for the Republican ticket in 2008?  He is a true fiscal conservative who wants small government, and I don't agree with most of what he says, but I LOVE the way he says it.  He's not a hot-head, and he backs up what he says with data rather than catch phrases (which the left is also guilty of, "yes we can" is not the same as "yes we will").

The entire point of political parties is so people can have their voices heard, and it is in no one's interest to disqualify what someone is saying.  I'm not a Tea Party supporter, but if I was, I'd be disappointed at the leadership that my fellow fiscal conservatives elected because they make no effort to centralize their view for mass appeal.  The Tea Party's stance can still be extreme so long as they listen and compromise to some extent when legislation hits the floor.

Our governments' politics are slow processes involving constant discussion and debate, and eventually compromise; this is how our nation was founded, and this is how the debt ceiling debate has gone (even though I don't really like the compromise, but it will be addressed further).  Anything that moves fast could incite violence, which is something that we are better than.
&gt;we live in a society where government has created corporations that socialize the risk of doing business on to the people, and these private/public entities leech on society through corporate welfare that they need in order to survive because of how twisted government has made the incentive structure in this nation, and how many jobs are at stake.

I would like some examples please.

&gt;and when the tea party draws a line before the last Jenga block is pulled, everyone acts like we're the ones pulling it.

Oh my, you accidentally referred to yourself as a tea partier there.

The Tea Party hasn't been helpful and all they have done is made the world less trusting of the U.S. dollar.  The debt ceiling issue is about past debt and new budgets are a completely separate matter.  It's just been hyperbolized by the party of ignorance and failure to understand science, economics, history, and government, the Tea Party.

You can't just say less, less, less, less.  Taxes are the lowest that they've been in half a century. 


Agreed.  Like they say, there is nothing new under the sun....

Uh, we were raising money and voting for Ron Paul.  You might as well have just asked, "where was the tea party when the tea party was just being formed?"  We've since grew the movement to what it is today.

As far as demanding compromise, we're looking forward to seeing more Democrats and Republicans doing it as we move our agenda forward.
The neocons within the Republican establishment don't want to cut defense.  And the establishment tea party leaders that they have installed also don't want to cut defense.  The actual core of the tea party sees defense (as well as foriegn aid) as primary things to cut in order to secure things that government has promised like social security and medicare.

Here's the plan:

1.    Reduce overall federal spending  
2.    Prioritize cuts in oversize expenditures, especially the military  
3.    Prioritize cuts in corporate welfare  
4.    Use 50 percent of the savings from cuts in overseas spending to shore up entitlement programs for those who are dependent on them and the other 50 percent to pay down the debt  
5.    Provide for reduction in federal bureaucracy and lay out a plan to return responsibility for education to the states.  
6.    Begin transitioning entitlement programs from a system where all Americans are forced to participate into one where taxpayers can opt out of the programs and make their own provisions for retirement and medical care

right because saying that it was a "stupid fucking post" isn't hostile. Get a grip brah
liberal here. This jk_bot dude is a fag and doesnt know shit about whats going on so he likes to insult people all for the benefit of trolling... Fag. Have an upvote Hotsor. Anyways, I feel as if I am an independent, but I like to see both sides rather than look at just one. Honestly, the biggest downfall of the Republican Party is that they cant get along within their own party. 
lol, I meant that I trusted it would be used for what it was labeled.  Policing where taxes go should be a priority.
Why do you get so angry so fast? 

I was under the impression that libertarians were backing Ron Paul before.  The term "Tea Party" didn't enter my vocabulary until just before the 2010 midterms.  And from my interactions with Studen Liberty Front, the libertarian organization at my school, they really dislike everything about the Tea Party's antics.  

I'm sorry that I didn't know the origins of you're cause.

However, as I stated before, which was the entire point of my comment, the Tea Party's platform is not its problem as far as making their voice heard by non-conservatives.  Its confrontationial attitudes like yours. 

 I didn't come on here and say "the Tea Party is stupid" or any other insult, I made a few observations and labeled them as my opinion, and you're immediately defensive and digging in for a fight.  There's no need for this.  We're both American, we both want a better government, we just approach it in differen't ways.

If you go around huffing and puffing about how right you are instead of having discussions and keeping an open mind, you'll never expand your horizons, and you'll only ever be able to talk with people who agree with you.  Where's the fun in that?  More importantly, where's the growth in that?

&gt;&gt;Why do you get so angry so fast?

I'm a mixed race guy who gets told that I'm a racist on a regular basis by people who don't have an OUNCE of experience in real racism, just because I believe in the libertarian message of the tea party.  It tends to make you defensive and angry.  And that's without mentioning the constant "tea bagger" references from the "sensible and adult" left.  What's to be angry about?

You are right though.  We are digging in for a fight.  We're under assault from the establishment in this country with the Establishment Left calling us "idiots" and the Establishment Right calling us "Hobbits."  If we seem a little bit keyed right now, it's because we are steeling our resolve, and our message isn't as flowery as "HOPE" and "CHANGE", but instead it's about doing the tough things so that we have a nation to pass on tomorrow.
Would also reduce the cost of the IRS in admin if nothing else.
My family lost a house to a wildfire.  One of the reasons was that the city promised to build a reservoir back in the late 80's.  Pump station burned down, so we had no water.  The reservoir was supposed to be at the top of a hill, we would have had gravity fed at least.  It never got built because they didn't have the $2 million to do it.  Mid 90's they bought a $29 million golf course.  Since then I've kept a closer eye on where my tax money goes.  
&gt; Republicans seem to be fine with spending loads of money on defense and other expenditures they deem important

This. As a centrist in my extreme-far-right family, I have this discussion frequently. (And by extreme-far-right I'm talking about blaming Obama for absolutely everything and looking at every executive decision he makes as some sort of socialist-liberal conspiracy against freedom. My father implied that Obama was Hitler yesterday.)

I digress.

For example, I asked my family if they would support cutting military research funding on a stealth fighter jet if our technology was 30 years ahead of the rest of the world. 

Their answer? "No, stay 30 years ahead." When I asked what they would cut, their answer? "Not the military." People with this kind of mindset won't cut military funding period. They want all the benefits with zero taxes.
Why do you assume I haven't experienced racism?
I have friends like this.  Their mindset seems to be "so long as we have better and more plentiful guns than anywhere else, we can pretty much do whatever, and who can stop us??"

It scares the shit out of me that people like that exist.
No it's definitely not a case of 'we can do whatever we want.'

They view it as 'this is essential so that China doesn't nuke us.'

Essentially, people like this seem to think that the entire world is out to murder us, but are stopped only by our vastly superior military technology.
I'm simply answering the question. This is 'probably' why most Republicans (i.e. constituents, not politicians) believe in lower taxes.
Okay, since you're someone that's actually willing to at least listen to me, I'd love to give you my extreme views. I'm a full-blown Libertarian, which means that I have Liberal morals, and Conservative economics. I believe that there is no place for the government in my every day life. My entire life, growing up as I did I have seen a whole slew of different economic lifestyles. When I was born, we were rich. When I was 7, we lost everything... And when I was 10 we had worked out way back into middle class. 

Here's the basis for my views and why I feel the way I do. [Here](http://www.zerohedge.com/article/entitlement-america-head-household-making-minimum-wage-has-more-disposable-income-family-mak?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+zerohedge%2Ffeed+%28zero+hedge+-+on+a+long+enough+timeline%2C+the+survival+rate+for+everyone+drops+to+zero%29) you will find a news article that will elaborate my perspective. It shows how in our current system of welfare, someone that makes a mere $14k a year with 3 children can actually have MORE disposable income than the guy who spent the last 4 years and $60-100k in college working to better himself. Tell me, when people spend all day begging for a fair chance, how is this fair? I have been supporting myself since the day I turned 17, and I've worked full time since I turned 16. I know a lot of people say that and it sounds like total bullshit, but at least in my case, that's how I was raised. 

Second, my father now owns a small business of his own. To give you an idea of why Republicans freak out about taxes, think about it this way. Say you own a furniture company. The average profit margin for a company in America has been [8.3%](http://www.fool.com/investing/value/2006/03/01/the-profit-margin-paradigm.aspx), so we'll go with that. Say that this company constructs furniture from wood which is harvested and cut into logs by a separate logging company. Once the furniture is crafted, assembled, stained, and finished it has to be transported to a warehouse. It is then shipped out as it is purchased by other companies to be sold in a retail store. So, let's break down their cost (since they ONLY make chairs; keep in mind these numbers are arbitrary) like this: They pay for the wood for 1 chair ($10), the stain ($2), the labor ($4), the transport/storage costs ($20), and the rest of the overhead for the company/per chair ($14). They then have the ability to sell each chair for $54.15 to a retailer. This is their entire process. Now say that the government decided that they need to raise taxes on say, gasoline. This increases the costs of producing/transporting the wood by the logging company; it means the cost of producing wood stain have gone up for the company combining the chemicals and shipping it to this chair company. Now since virtually everything that is produced at all is transported at some point, you could then say that this raises the cost of producing the chair at every single step of the process. 

This means that the company has to hope that all of these costs together don't equal more than $4.15 out of the $50 that they already put into the chair. If it does, what will they have to do? That's right, raise their prices as well. This is my point at hand, any increase in corporate taxes doesn't hurt those companies like the media says it does. They aren't going to sit there and take such a loss in profit... Ask yourself, what would a greedy corporation do? Raise their price. What does that mean?

It means that when they raise the taxes on something like gasoline, they have effectively (i know this is an over-generalization, but look at what has happened in the last few years!) raised the cost of making EVERYTHING that we as consumers buy. This means that as that tax raises, guess where the money comes from? You and me, the honest, hard working fellow, trying to just survive.

Now, there's more than just this but I have to go soon so I'll wrap it up. If you combine those two factors, what would you think is going to happen? If you work hard to make money, you won't have any more money than the guy that is working in fast food, receiving welfare. Second, take into account that the reason you can't afford to live, is to PAY for that same guy to get welfare. The majority of my life has been spent in middle class, just rich enough to get all of the taxes, but not poor enough to receive any of the benefits. Tell me now, did what I said make any sense? 

P.S. Good luck with your inquiry, I hope you and I can both learn something out of this!

His name is Ron Paul, not Rand Paul.
That's when you vote those decision-makers out of office... 

My view is why starve the beast when you, as a voter, have the power to tame, reform, and correct it so that it's not a beast anymore? Starving the beast won't work when the rest of the nation is already spending less because of recession. 

You hate the decision makers/government? Good, a lot of us do. Let's FIX it, not get rid of it. You don't trust where your money's going? Good, being skeptical of your government is great, but you don't respond by starving it with lower taxes and trying to eliminate it (note that i'm not saying YOU in particular, I'm more talking about tea partiers). You figure out who's behind the government; who is REALLY making the decisions here? 

In your case you have every right to not trust your city's government. They made a poor decision. Criticize those who made the decisions, ask questions, and make an effort to make sure those who made that decision aren't in power anymore. Good, keep a close eye on your tax dollars and keep track of where they're heading! That's great that you care to look into where your money goes... but that doesn't mean you lower the amount of taxes you give, it means you make sure your tax dollars aren't being exploited, like in your case. 
I think is one the most eloquent responses I've read in some time about this subject. I have one question, though. 

Why is the creation of programs with tax money always seen as "government control over personal life." The way I see it, that's what law is. If you cut spending on something that I find important like let's say education, then you are still controlling my life in a different way aren't you? 
Moderate here, I just popped in to say that this is by far the best discussion i've seen on Reddit. Everyone for the most part is being very polite and taking all views into account. Upvotes for all. 
That's a good point...
To be honest, I've always understood Libertarians.  My question was more for Republicans.  I always consider them to be different from one another just as I consider Progressive to be different from Democrat.  

But I do know what you're saying about the effect of taxes.  I think that to common people and small businesses they are oppressive.

However, with respect to the income tax, Republicans are against legislation that would take more burden off of these people and put it on America's highest earners.  This reform would effectively tax the people who are most in need of their money less.  I distinguish Libertarians from Republicans by the fact that a Libertarian hates all tax raises, while a Republican hates some tax raises. 

 I know why conservatives exist, just not why the conservative party violates its own principles to help the super-rich
Exactly
I disagree.  The U.S. government has a strong sense of the separation of powers that is lacking in the Westminster model.
I appreciate the reply.  To reply to your question, the distinction comes from understanding the difference between provision and protection.  Under conservative thought, the goal of good law it to _protect_ personal rights, not provide them.  

The logic behind it is this; the problem is, when government begins to act like a business (and as many conservatives see it, that is exactly what providing education, welfare, whatever truly is whether we like it or not) it stops trying to protect the people, and instead begins to protect itself.  The more the government "takes over" in the private sector, the more it tries to sustain itself.  And the more the government tries to sustain itself, the less it focuses on its citizens.  

This is where understanding the constitutional view of things certainly can define your view.  I certainly understand how many would argue that education is a human right, and I completely agree.  But again, libertarian view would argue that the purpose of government would be to PROTECT education, not provide it.   

It's very much the same distinction that is made between separation of church and state.  By the same logic, there should be a separation of education and state, or healthcare and state.  Or pretty much anything for that matter.  Under a conservative or libertarian view the governments should simply be protecting a persons right to learn in an enviornment they choose, the seek safe healthcare where they want, worship (or not worship) any god they want. 

Again, I'm not necessarily saying I agree with every libertarian argument 100%, but this the general consensus behind libertarian thought.   
Absolutely great
Just the fact that nobody in the media, including MSLSD, are reporting on this it's pretty evident that this basically means shit.
I think, however, that there is a misunderstanding in what constitutes a government. What I see is that conservatives/libertarians and liberals/progressives have their logic somewhat crossed. The right (I'll abbreviate) seems to consider the government as this foreign, intrusive apparatus which is a necessary evil because, like you said, it should be there to protect our rights. Whereas the left sees the government as, is stated in the first sentence of the Constitution, themselves, a tool, a valuable well-oiled resource for the People to do with what they see fit. So we get stuck. Instead of the right asking for the government to operate better it wants to see it diminished which the left doesn't understand because they see themselves as the government. But in this misunderstanding they (the left) stand up and fight for any foothold they might be able to achieve no matter how inefficient or costly it might be. 

Personally, I side with left ideological, but I don't approve of many of the people who the left has elected. Furthermore, and more importantly, I think we have to regroup and reevaluate our understanding on a semantic level. Some may say semantics is trite and meaningless, but I can't agree with that - our languages and symbolism define our perspectives and our ideology. Most importantly, our understanding of the word government needs to be addressed. Because like I said, and maybe I'm different from other who associate with the left, but I view the government (for and by the people or something, right?) as us specifically. If you and I build a house I would not argue if one were to say that house was built by the government. Likewise, on a grander scale, if we establish an education system, yes it's an arm of the government, but *we* are the government. Washington, D.C. is only HQ, not some big, scary overlord looming above us peaceful people on the hillside. If my only option were private schools I would feel like my life were under control because I would want us to be working together to create schools that everyone can attend, places where the educators can be open and challenging without having to face some angry C.E.O. I feel the same way about health care. We need to stop thinking about government as someone else taking my money and giving it away to low lives, when it should be us willingly cooperating with a shared goal in mind. I don't feel like this line of thinking is radical, or socialist, or idealistic, I think it's civilized. I think both sides in Congress are radical and only seeking power not solutions. I think partisan rancor is only putting us in a place where we can't work together. We are fighting over who's right and who's wrong in Washington. And, who cares? We can take our country back if we want to (like the Tea Partiers like to say) but that doesn't mean we shouldn't function collectively at some level. We just need to go about it more appropriately. 
&gt;Government spends too much, and liberals don't police their own programs.

You do realize that the Pentagon can't account for trillions of dollars right?
I don't know why he's being downvoted. Clearly this is a popular conservative explanation, and anikom is simply answering OP's question in the polite manner that OP requested. 
Blah, I disagree with that. Mainly because I'm not very informed as to what every party does on a day to day basis, but my reason is simple: ALL politicians are only out there to gain political power, no matter what they say, or what they promise. I don't much like Republicans because they stick their nose in peoples every-day life just like the Democrats do. But here's my shpeal, if you raise the taxes on the super-rich to such a high extent (Btw, you should take a look at what the Democrats are classifying as 'super-rich') then there's absolutely no reason to even try to become rich. Why should I work my entire life (trust me, it doesn't happen over-night, I watched my dad build this business from nothing for 7 years, 60-80 hrs a week) to become rich? All of his blood sweat and tears are going to support the people I went to high-school with. The same people I heard saying that they WANTED to have 3-6 kids so that they could get a check every month... 

So just ask yourself, in the land of opportunity, prosperity, and wealth... Where has it all gone? Why isn't it here anymore? 
(My thoughts are that it had quite a bit to do with the fact that anyone that makes it, has to give most of it away.)

My two last points:
1-My dad showed me the math on exactly what he pays in taxes... Of the $350k the company (a company with 1 other employee) pulls in a year(after expenses), he is taxed until he gets to keep about $90k... Would you work for 7 years at 60-80hrs a week, to keep 1/4 of what you make?
2-I'm telling you right now, as bad as Conservative news can be, don't even consider the fact that Liberal news could be better. It's not, there's just more of them out there. If you are really curious, I suggest you dive into the history books, and take a look at every country that tried to become Liberal. There are a few examples that are doing fine, but all of the others have crashed and burned much like America is doing now. 


PS. Also, did you know that the Republicans used to be the working-man's class? In colonial America, they were the ones fighting for every man's rights. Why would that work if these principles exist only to help the rich? And don't think they were more ignorant than we are, because I can tell you right now, the average person has been dropping in intellect ever since we stopped needing to actually learn anything. 
In reference to the Bush tax cuts:

"The non-partisan Pew Charitable Trusts estimated in May 2010 that extending some or all of the tax cuts would have the following impact under these scenarios:

-Making the tax cuts permanent for all taxpayers, regardless of income, would increase the national debt $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years.


-Limiting the extension to individuals making less than $200,000 and married couples earning less than $250,000 would increase the debt about $2.2 trillion in the next decade.


-Extending the tax cuts for all taxpayers for only two years would cost $561 billion over the next 10 years."

this is taken from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts#Debate_over_effect_of_cuts).

The definition of "rich" is a household income of over $250k per year.  My parents fall into this category and even though they wouldn't like it, they'd be completely fine if they had to pay a higher percentage of their income.  Infact, they could probably have the same amount of disposable income under higher taxes if they had bought compact cars instead of big SUVs.

I understand what you're saying about working hard and getting a reward, but the fact of the matter is that we are in a period where Americans need to tighten their belts.  The American dream was never to work hard and get rich, it was to live in peace and be guarenteed individuality and freedom.

As far as your father's business goes, 350/2 leaves 175k per person, of that they'd each keep 72% (they fall into the 28% tax bracket) assuming it was reported as "income" , leaving 126,000 for your dad.  This is from the federal income tax of course.  And of the 36,000 more that is removed, its most likely for social security and local taxes for services like policemen or firefighters or roads.  Either way, ending the Bush tax cuts would benefit your dad so long as your mom didn't push household income above $250k.

Taxes are shitty, but they're necessary for society to run.  Also you may want to check out [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/30/AR2010073002671.html) link to the Washington Post.

Also, do not say that liberal countries fail when the  most successful countries in the world are currently some of the most liberal.  I do not claim that the Norweigian or Danish system would work in a country as large and diverse as America, however, this does not mean we cannot learn from them.

And as a response to your Post Script:  The working-man's party were the Democratic Republicans who formed the basis of the Democratic Party.  Thus the Democrats are the [party of Jefferson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party#Claims_to_the_party.27s_heritage) of which you speak that was devoted to the working man.
I definitely agree.  I think most political arguments stem from different understandings of what government is and what it should do.  I honestly think there are very few evil people.  There are obviously the Hitlers and Moas but as much as many hate Obama, I think even the strongest dissentors know that he is only trying to do his best.  And the same can probably be said for Bush, as much as I dislike him.  

The issue isn't motive, and unfortunately, American politicians spend to much time talking about stupid things people say and impuning people for bad motives, instead of understand WE ALL WANT TO MAKE AMERICA A BETTER PLACE.  Now lets sit and have a rational discussion (like we are now) and fugure out what that entails.

So that's my rant.  I guess I take the opposite side of the spectrum from "both sides in Congress are radical and only seeking power not solutions." But that's just me trying to be optimistic.

I definitely appreciate your perspective, and thank you for sharing.  Good point on semantics. But I do think semantics _become_ meaningless though when we don't follow through on what we say.  But that is definitely what we are doing right now :)

I want to countinue our discussion but I'm at work.  More comments soon to come!
Alright, you win... You are much more informed than I am, but I was explaining my point of view.... Also, you know what would shrink the deficit even WITH Bush's tax cuts? (who I don't like btw, so don't throw him in anyone's face just because they're not liberal) LOWERING THE DAMN SPENDING! You know what? fuck it man, he can keep the taxes, I don't care... but [here's](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20019931-503544.html) the bottom line. You pointed out, the Bush tax cuts would cost the country $5.5 trillion, over the next 10 years, well... in the FOUR years of his term, Obama is projected to spend "$5.9-trillion." So, my good sir, tell me, how is it SUCH a problem that we are going to lose LESS money in DOUBLE the time, when Obama has already set his eye on spending MORE in just four years. Not to mention, this is all before Obamacare kicks in. 

Here's my point, since Obama has come into office, my father's business went from supporting 4 employees at $11/hr to barely being able to afford the taxes for two, at $8/hr. Keep in mind that the business has grown 70% this year as well. 

Like I said, I don't care about the taxes, they are at least bearable for now, but if we don't cut the spending... we're done for. Do you not realize that we already maxed out the countries credit-card? When you max out your credit, do you keep pulling ahead at full steam? A country is no different!

 :/ All I say is that I want to keep the money I earn, and I don't accept handouts... I've survived on my own since the day I turned 17. If someone else can't do the same, fuck them. I started with nothing, and managed to pay for a car, apartment, my own food, insurance, cellphone, AND (Community)College... All out of my own pocket, while going to school. I'm tired of people complaining when they are too irresponsible to manage their own money. I understand that life isn't as cheap in other places, but believe it or not I did all this on $7k a year. 

I feel for people and give homeless people I see water/food/SOMETHING when I see them, but I am tired of people EXPECTING me to give them the sweat off my fucking brow. I started at minimum wage, and made it. If you can't, you don't deserve a single cent of my money. Yeah, I'm a heartless bastard, but at least I don't have to swallow my pride every time I cash a check. I know that what I have, I worked my ass off for. And I swear, if things don't change, people won't have my hard work to leech off of for long. I'm leaving this country to watch it collapse under the weight of it's own ignorance and laziness. I'd rather live on a farm in the middle of nowhere than spend another year of my life, working to support someone that thinks I owe it to them because I'm intelligent, young, and strong... when they are not. 

THAT... Is why I'm Libertarian. 

Edit:Coding, oh and also, didnt realize I was talking to OP, lol sorry... had a rough day.. I will read your response... Just.. had to vent.. again, sorry, but that's been something I haven't said... and I needed to get it off my chest.. &gt;.&lt; my bad
What do you think the rich do with the money they don´t spend on their own consumption? They invest it. And investments create jobs for other people. So there is no need to tax that away from them. We want jobs to be created. And there is no moral problem here. The billionaire does not enjoy his wealth in any way until he uses it for consumption and then he would pay tax on it.
True, but in today's global economy it's unusual for billionaires to invest all of that money in *American* companies.
From what you're telling me, fiscal conservatism seems like it's less about economics and more about separating the strong from the weak.

While it is really impressive that you were able to support yourself, I doubt you started off as poorly as some Americans do start off. I also doubt that the average American is as smart as you are.  From what you're saying, it was incredibly difficult to bring yourself up from when you started off at 17.

However, assuming that you are absolutely average in your mental ability and work ethic, that means that the average American would have to struggle tooth and nail to plan and budget as to perform such a feat without help.

However, from your comments and story, you seem as if you'd be above average, meaning that the average American may not even have been able to overcome the difficulties you describe.  Now think of a real average American, or for that matter, the other half of Americans below the average.  Many of these people start off in far worse situations; parents in debt, inherited involvement with organized crime, pressure to join gangs, drug addiction, psychological problems, mental disabilities, racism, glass ceilings, corrupt local governments.  How will they fare?

The welfare system is for these people.  True, social funding is currently provided to many people who take advantage, but I'd rather fund a few lazy people and ensure the well being of those in true need than deny America's downtrodden the chance to live life under a roof like a human just as punishment to these few.  I'm not a religious man, but I'm pretty sure this type of logic is right up the Christians' ally.

Also, concerning the national debt under Obama.  It would make sense to blame him for the national debt, if only he got any of his own policy through.  Non of the Democratic tax reform or budget cuts have ever gone through.  Defense is still sky high and revenue is still inhibited by the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.  Maybe if the Democrats have determined the direction of the country's policy could you blame them for the current debt.  Republicans, through the filibuster and their majority in the house for the second half of Obama's term have determined economic policy through obstructionism.

Now, all of that being said, I agree that we need huge spending cuts.  However, supplementing the cuts by taxing people who can afford it at higher rates will speed recovery even further.  When you were strapped for cash you worked hard to get a higher paying job, and you saved money; you increased your revenue and decreased your spending.  The fact that the budget needs cutting is not the point of contention in Congress, it is the fact that all suggested cuts from the right are for social programs.

Furthermore, and finally, please don't move out of the country; we need all of the people we can who give a damn and are willing to work hard to stay here and help fix our system.  We live in  a great country, and we have a responsibility to keep it great for our children, and for the sake of the world outside of our borders who depend on our economic stability and humanitarian aid.

My favorite thing about America is that it started out as a lost cause.  Turning misfortune and doubt into conviction and progress is what we do best.  These types of discussions are what allow us to make balanced decisions in government that will guide our republic through the storm.

Two weeks later and I get a grammar Nazi. Thanks Reddit.
Okay here is the way I look at this situation.  The top 10% are already paying around 30% of their income in taxes, which is quite a bit of money.  In addition, they tend to donate more money.  Much of the top 10% population own businesses as well which requires a large pool of money to continue supporting the business even if it isn't doing well, to prevent job loss.  So I feel that the top 10% are already paying their fair share, just like everyone else.  That is how I view everything.  I understand that there are crooks out there but it is the same for those who rely on welfare checks as their only source of income because that is not fair either.   Btw thank you for having a mature and fair debate :)  and upboat for you.
It's water that made them multiply.
See, here's the thing... the reason I feel the way that I do about all of this... It was NOT hard, at ALL.. so what if I had to eat ramen for a few weeks straight here and there. I'm angry because I wouldn't have struggled at ALL had I not been losing an extra 10% of what I made. 

Here's another thing, like I said, I started with nothing, riding the bus to work. A friend of mine was homeless and lived in a shelter, with nothing. He still managed to work his way out of it (no more than 3 months ago), as a felon I might add, and it's not because he was the brightest bulb on the tree. It was because he woke up at 5am every day, and walked to find work until he found a steady job. 

I believe that there is no excuse for someone no matter what they were involved in or grew up in. I grew up in public schools, hearing so many people complaining about what chances they didn't have because of their skin color, financial background, abusive families, etc... But do you know what I actually listened to? The many people that grew up in similar situations, only to succeed in life. 

My (ex)homeless friend told me this: "If you really want to change your life, you can. Your life is exactly how you want it to be, because if you wanted out bad enough, you'd leave."

It's true, one of my teachers in high-school told me that he grew up in California, in crip/blood territory. He said that when you live there, you're either in the gang, or you're killed by them. Guess what he did? Played it safe until he was 16, got on a bus, and went across the country to start over. So any of these "I can't because.." stories fall on an un-sympathetic ear. 

And you're right, I do believe in Social Darwinism... That's why I've worked hard my entire life to not fall on the bottom of the food chain. If someone is physically un-fit to work, FINE. I will gladly pay taxes to support them, but for any other reason? Fuck them. Like I said, both of my parents were starting over with almost nothing by the time I was 7. I watched both of them put in the hours and hours of hard work so that my brother and I could have a good life. The more money they made, the less things we had. 

I remember very distinctly, one year my mom got a raise. Being young, I thought it was a good thing... until she explained to me that that extra 2k a year put us up in the next tax bracket, which actually ended up costing us something like an extra 6k. We barely had enough money to afford food for the next year. 

On another note, please explain how Obama couldn't get anything passed in the two years that we had a D controlled.. everything? 

Second, fuck this country. I hate the democratic fiscal policy, and the republicans are looking to control everything.. have you seen that new "anti-online child predator" bill? Net neutrality? ...the list goes on. Besides, I'm not going to work to support a system that I think is destroying the country and I'm not going to stay in a country where even though I'm one of the few succeeding, I am demonized by all of the have-nots... fuck that, fuck them, and fuck the idea of self-sacrifice. I'm libertarian because I am an Objectivist and not what they have become. In fact, I have one tattoo, and it's a phrase.. an oath I took. 

"I swear - by my life and my love of it - that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."
If you know where that came from, then you know why I don't plan on staying in this country. The person that came up with that grew up in Soviet Russia. 

Last but not least, America started out as the promised land. Streets paved with gold? We've done nothing but progressively fail since our gold years. 
I feel like the reason people dont want to raise taxes is the fact that we see many people taking advantage of the system. I have no problem paying taxes but when I see other people from my school sleeping in till noon and playing video games all day it pisses me off. Why should I help these bums? Of course it isnt everyone who abuses the system but it sometimes is hard to see those in need actually getting help. America has been getting more and more corrupt. Even non profit CEOs making over 2 million dollars really bothers me. I dont want to continue waking up at 530 just to support someone else.

I think that if people collect welfare then there should be more rules applied to it. Rules like you cant have a net wealth of a certain amount, you cant use the money for anything other than staple food (food stamps), you can only collect it for a certain number of years, you must continue to look for a job. And I think the most important thing is that it should not be given out for free. In exchange people should have to do community service like cleaning roads, etc for like 10 hours a week, unless physically unable. 

I am disgusted with free handouts and its hard to want to pay higher taxes unless things change. 
The OP probably isn't the one downvoting him..seeing that he has more than one downvote.
This is the classic response I am seeing more and more nowadays. Unfortunately the [fact of the matter](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/06/28/256605/chart-lower-taxes-on-the-rich-dont-lead-to-job-growth/) is that data gathered on income taxes vs. unemployment shows a correlation between income tax decreases to the top marginal earners and an increase in unemployment.

**EDIT**: raising the minimum wage and offering tax breaks to corporations (not individuals) who hire workers within the United States would go a long way to fixing the economy. But the most crucial thing that can be done is bringing back the legislation which required 'news' corporations to use factual information when they claim to be using factual information. 
You people amaze me. I knew once that Cock-Sucking Bush left office there would be a sudden bout of amnesia. Let's be reminded of a couple things:

After 9-11, the government received a blank check on defense and National Security. Yes it was bi-partisan, but once again CSGWB provided the check,  the pen, the signature. 

Let me shift gears here. See the news lately about the recall of 36 million pounds of turkey with tainted salmonella? Ever gotten food poisoning before? Think inspection comes free?

Ok, stick with me here little buddy. Let's do the time warp again. Remember that Iraqi war? Wow, that resolved alot. Oh Afghanistan as well. Man that is a relief. Those wars are definitely fixing the terrorists issues.

Remember Bernie Madoff? Now I know he wasn't a direct issue with the debt, but he was definitely a symptom of the illness with the SEC and other government issues? 

Oh, TARP? Remember a lot of banks needing bailouts? That didn't come on the cheap.

How about some National disasters that occurred? Katrina? Joplin? Twin Towers folks? Shall I keep going?

Wow. Spoken like someone who's truly in denial of the problem 
What happened to you, Republican Party. You were the party of Bill Buckley and Dwight David Eisenhower; now you offer us Mitt Romney and Michelle Bachmann.

We need a viable candidate to put Obama out of office and you give us this to choose from?

You can and must do better - and I think we all know it.
&gt;I remember very distinctly, one year my mom got a raise. Being young, I thought it was a good thing... until she explained to me that that extra 2k a year put us up in the next tax bracket, which actually ended up costing us something like an extra 6k. We barely had enough money to afford food for the next year.

I've heard this a lot over the years and really that's not possible as a sole result of an income increase.  Tax brackets work such that each portion of your income is taxed at the appropriate rate.  This is probably easier to explain with an example (I'm going to use fake numbers for ease of math):

If you had a tax rate of 10% for $0-10,000, and then 20% for &gt;$10,000...

A person with a $9000 income would be taxed $900 for an income of $8100.

A person with a $10k income would be taxed $1000 for an income of $9000.

But if you went to $11k income, you would not pay 20% of the full $11k ($2200, a big jump resulting in a net income of $8800, where you lost money).  Rather that person would pay 10% of the first $10k, and then 20% on the remaining $1000 (0.1 x 10000+ 0.2 x (11000-10000)), for a total tax of $1200, and a net income of $9800.

So as you can see, it's impossible for a gain in income to cause you to get less money total.  Whenever that person got an income raise, their net income still went up, even if they paid more in taxes.  The only exception to that (that I could imagine, I'm not even sure if it exists but I don't know all the subtleties of tax code at the low end of income) might be if you no longer qualified for some separate tax break.  But the income brackets themselves never hurt you.  I'm not sure what the situation was with your family and I'm sure that was a trying time for you, but it wasn't the fault of the tax code and your anger with it is misplaced.

OP, why does religion matter?


Also, you're on Reddit so you will find many atheists (myself included) and because this is /r/republicans you will find Christians.
So let me get this straight...

You saw her as you were walking by, and you refused to try to talk to her because you assumed she was stupid? Therefore she's a vile bitch and a whore? But let me guess, you're a real Republican, right? Everyone else is faking?

Gov't needs to be smaller. Period.
I fully agree with the fact that welfare should be closely monitored.  It is money for people who need it until they get another job, not money for people who aren't trying to get a job or better their prospects.  Personally, I think welfare should only be applicable if the person enrolls in some sort of educational program.  For instance, a guy gets laid off from his job in fast food, but can only collect welfare/unemployment if he starts taking classes at a community college.  

Sure, it may mean more money spent per unemployed person, but if there were a strict time limit on how long they got it until it ran out, then they'd have motivation to perform well in school and get a job such that they don't need government checks any longer.

The current welfare state is abused thoroughly, I'm not going to combat that.  What I am saying is that welfare is absolutely necessary.  A measure that is just as necessary is strict supervision of those on welfare.  As it is now, we throw money at people and say "fix your situation". The way it should be is the government assigning every few welfare recipients to a parole officer of sorts who brings their check/food stamps, and checks that the unemployed person is truly trying to find a career rather than just a job.

I think we can all agree that the government needs massive reform on how it goes about spending its money, where we (conservatives and I) differ is that I am comfortable letting the government handle a larger percentage of my money so long as they can responsibly use it such that all of society benefits.  

The main issue that I'm seeing is that people aren't willing to pay attention to things.  If half of voters were attentive and cared as much as the people who commented here so far, we'd be in better shape no matter what direction (liberal or conservative) our government went.
The problem with taxing luxury goods is that it would not hurt the buyer because these goods are not essential, or the demand for these goods is not inelastic. The yachtmaker/jeweler would end up being hit because they would have to lower their prices to stay in competition. This could mean lower wages or laying off some of the lower income workers (cause you know the executives are not gonna be taking the pay cuts). Obviously not what we are trying to do. 
This also doesn't really matter. Trade makes everyone better off. Like you said, the economy has become global and economic problems should be analyzed on a global level. Basic example: Country X can produce sugar for very cheap so Americans get all of their sugar from Country X (Its cheaper saving us money) Country X's economy starts to go down the shitter the price of sugar goes up, Ice Cream stores in America have to pay more for their product so some go out of business, etc. etc. 

Or: An American billionaire invest in a foreign company that can then provide American consumers with a cheaper product and therefore saves them money. Its all interconnected.

Down voted for not agreeing with OP.
Alright, you obviously know everything. Here's the deal, yes the numbers are arbitrary, and I don't give a shit what the real ones are. All I know is that the story is true, so don't tell me what was possible or impossible... I was there, it was my own fucking childhood, get it? Anyways, your mind is made up and now you're arguing about details... So, best of luck to you. I'm out
why are you so for raising taxes?  can you honestly say that the government is currently using every cent from every dollar as efficiently as it can?  until it can i can't see why you would have any justification for raising taxes.  you may say obscene corporate profits but what about obscene government debt and waste; that's what the discussion should be about.       
you're right, we should talk about what you want to talk about, not what the thread is about, please continue.
Condi Rice? why? any policy of hers that you like?
i believe within my previous statement i gave my reason why i am so against raising taxes; government is highly inefficient.  which is right on topic.  do you have any thoughts on government efficiency? 
=/ I wasn't actually the one who you were talking to before, I just thought I'd try and help explain how tax brackets actually work.  Sorry if you somehow felt attacked by that.

Good lord - what would he say about the characters of today. As opposed to a superlative command of facts and language, concept and principle, we have "folksy" and "aw shucks" evangelist know-nothings.

I sincerely wish there were more candidates like Chris Christie who are intelligent, articulate and while I don't agree with his methods or practices all the time, he genuinely is taking corrupt political bosses to the cleaners - he works well with his democratic and republican colleagues and avoids above all the showmanship and bullshit that characterized the national party system.

He could certainly stand to be alot more charitable to those groups he's displacing - librarians, cops, firemen etc, putting work transition programs in place or some such - but by and large, it's a model that is in STARK contrast to the anti-democratic antics of his counterparts in Wisconsin with the John Birch/Tea Party BS that pervades. 
It goes really to the idea that the government cannot create real wealth with the money. A citizen can create wealth by starting a business or purchasing machinery to increase productivity. Or buy himself a cheeseburger at a nearby store. Keynes said that the government could stimulate spending in individuals by undertaking huge works. Hayek said that the government couldn't. Keynesian thought led to the Hoover Dam and the TVA. All well and good, but the hoover dam could've been built by a private company and the TVA was, twenty years down the line, inefficient and costly. Republicans think that the individual can allocate resources to their best interest better than the government can allocate resources to the society's best interest.
'Constructive' and 'Republicans' are two incompatible concepts.

The idea that the government can spend your money better than you can is ridiculous.  The government waste is off the charts, rather than make tough (lol) decisions about not funding things like shrimps running on treadmills they'd rather just take more of your money.  Without more of our money they can't feed their donors to keep them in office.

I would agree that its inefficient, but this isn't an incurable condition.  I'm all for fixing how money is spent and minimizing waste.  However, I also feel that in order to decrease the deficit, the government needs to take in more revenues **in addition** to minimizing waste and cutting spending.  

I think there is a disconnect between our two sides of the debate.  My side is prone to disregarding waste in government and inefficiency, whereas your side is prone to disregard the fact that higher revenue for the government doesn't necessarily mean tyranny if the money is well allocated and managed.
Let's not incite any mindless arguing.  There's no need to throw insults around.
You raise an interesting point, which is that funding for campaigns is what is paramount to many politicians on both sides of the aisle.

What's your stance on public campaign funding?  Personally I would like a system where donations to the *election* are accepted, but the money cannot be attributed to either candidate by the choice of the donor.  In essence, people would be funding the election over all rather than the candidate they like.  The money would then be divvied between all candidates evenly.  This would certainly reign in corruption in campaign funding, as well as lead to the promotion of some third party ideals that are relevent.
I'm for higher taxes because no matter which way you split it, adding revenue decreases the deficit.  I do not think that our problems should be solved only by increasing revenue, but I do think that they would be solved faster with a combination of heavy reform and waste management, spending cuts, and increased revenue from the wealthiest among us.
Because we feel that individuals know how to spend their money better than politicians.

Personally, I would like to abolish the IRS and all tax loopholes.  Every year, you get a mailed the following information (I will use example numbers)...

You made $75,000.
The avg income in the US was $50,000.
The flat rate of tax collection to balance the budget is 25%.
You owe 25% of your income above half national average... in other words, you owe .25 x ($75,000-$25,000) = $12,500.

This way, if you only made $25,000, you pay no taxes.  Every dollar above that base is taxed FAIRLY for EVERYONE.  ALSO, it makes federal spending tangible... when someone like Obama rebaselines spending to $2.6 Trillion, up from 1.6T, and everyone has to pay twice as much as the previous year, they realize there is a problem.


i prefer a system where a campaigns donations are capped at a certain amount.  A) fair elections B) money management/leadership are important in the election.  You can't pull a Obama and just spend a billion dollars, still almost lose, then get bailed out by a economic meltdown and STILL barely win with 51% of the popular vote.

Ronstadamus!!!!!!
Clinton is the one who thought every american deserved to own a house, regardless of if they could affort it or not.  Thats where freddie mac/frannie mae came in which is one of the chief culprits for why we're in this mess in the first place.  It's a common misconception that Bush is solely at fault for this mess.  Bush actually wanted to have tighter regulations for freddie/frannie but got shot down by congress.  Don't get me wrong he wasn't that great of a president, but hes better than the current joker in office.
With all due respect, I'm pretty sure George W. Bush lost the popular vote, and won based on a recount in 2000.  If his policies (and those of the republicans who controlled the senate and house) were better, there would've been no financial meltdown to bail out Obama, who won 53-46 against McCain in 2008.  

Also, if you're inferring that 51% of the popular vote is small, remember that you're most likely beloved Ronald Reagan won by 50% of the popular vote in 1980. Also GW Bush only won with 50% in 2004.  In fact, in the last 20 years, 53% is the largest percentage of the popular vote any president has won.
Even if that was me posting, there's no need to get defensive.  I remember a lot of things from my childhood, and I also forget a lot of things or remember them differently.  However, the "details" that we were arguing about are the actual mathematics of how federal taxes effect people.  It's unreasonable for you to throw out an anecdote, claim its true, then when you're confronted with how federal tax brackets work from a third party, start cursing and take the tone of an offended five year old.  

It is not appreciated and is hardly constructive.  You have no right to be mad at the truth because it doesn't line up with how you feel.  Also, there are numerous state taxes that could have sapped your parents' income.  However, this is not a concern of the federal government, nor does it effect the legitimacy of the federal income tax.  In essence, no one was calling you a liar, we were merely pointing out that the federal income tax was not responsible for you're father's loss in profits.

And I never claimed, nor ever claim, to know everything.  There's a difference between accuracy and arrogance, and you seem to not distinguish between the two.

Wow.  So much here to depress me.

In any case, the Tea Party does illuminate a rift in the GOP... which IMHO *IS* the symptom, not the problem.  You know why I am inspired by the Tea Party?  Because it is the closest thing to all that is right in this country... which is Libertarianism Minus Idiotic Foreign Policy.

"Neo-Conservatism" is the bane of the GOP, and the future of this country.  It is moral-conservatism mixed with fiscal-liberalism.  Both are terrible.  

We should be fiscally conservative, abide by the Constitution, and not turn off millions of voters coming across as giving a shit where/who someone else sticks their dick into, or what religion someone else is.  THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD LEGALLY CONDONE THAT EITHER.  What it means is that all that crap should be left to the STATES.  It only serves to make cases for Republicans to be painted as hypocrites, and to scare otherwise relatively Libertarian minded voters into the arms of the Dems.

The tea party opposes the fed, the Dept of Ed, the EPA, and plenty of other useful parts of our government. The problem is that they aren't smart enough to keep things from collapsing once you eliminate 1/2 of the government.
1. The republican party was created in the 1850s.

2. Before the 1920s, they were the liberal party in the US.

3. What countries(went liberal then failed) are you talking about? I can understand using Greece as an example, but they took social programs to an extreme and started paying for everything. The Government is there to help and provide assistance, not to full on be the provider for families.

Actually, from the Roman Republic(which broke up because the elites wouldn't agree to wealth redistribution), the Ancien Regime in France to the European countries in  1910(where from Spain through Russia to Germany, all countries were too focused on military spending and doing little to address the wealth disparity), conservative monetary policies like being against SLIGHT wealth redistribution end up hurting countries in the long run. 

Now this doesn't mean that I think someone like your father should lose 3/4 of his hard earned money to taxes, but I don't think he has earned any right to be taxed less than his counterparts. I do sympathise with the conservative stand on government spending though, and I am appalled at the sheer number of useless programs or overextended programs the government pays for.
 


I do think you have good points but you have some facts wrong

I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE!
sounds like campaign finance reform would fix most of the problems you speak of. 
If I may add my question: Why do Republicans seem so intent on cutting programs that help Americans such as Social Security, Medicare/caid and not on cutting nuclear spending, why is defense spending also not part of the waste of government spending?
I had a conversation earlier in the thread about this.  I completely agree.  I see the logic in cutting down on waste in government, however, how come the defense funding is never accounted for?  The U.S. military is the largest socialist organization in the world!  Soldiers who serve for 5 years receive a lifetime of benefits from the government.  Now, I'm not saying they didn't earn it, but I am saying that if this is possible for men and women in the armed forces, why isn't it possible for the rest of us?

Nice superlative command of the language there. It's "Bachmanns and Palins" without the apostrophes to make names plural.
Never said I was a master of the language, I can barely type.
We already have privately owned prisons that are allowed by law to operate and run without regulations. They are allowed to use you as a legal slave and if you don't work as thier slave you are forced into mental torture by being put into solitary confinement for 23 hours a day with no one to talk too. Humans are social animals by nature so by doing this you are torturing (whether you believe it or not, facts are facts)

We allow cops to arrest marijuana users every 35 seconds in this country, meanwhile every 12 seconds a burglary, break in, or rape happens and the cops are busy busting the marijuana user who did not beat his wife, or drive drunk and kill a child or anything, he just smoked a joint instead of drinking a beer or popping a antidepressant. 

Until we stop filling our prisons with innocent people that are easy to bust and "make quota" then we should not condone making someone pay for thier jail time when they are not in jail. 
i agree, i also think they should be privately owned and they should get more money for the work they do in prison, at least minimum wage , that could go to what they owe
Some riots, some more Mormons running, who knows what could happen...
Yes lets fix/improve the debt with more debt. 
We would probably be better off if we used prison labor to do all those jobs I keep hearing the rest of America wont do.  Few logistical issues, but you could probably pay them $1 a day to an account they get when they're released, and put the rest to room &amp; board.  

I kept hearing statistics that say 61% of recidivists do so because they didn't have money for first/last month's rest on their first month out.  If you're in for 5 years, you could work enough to take care of that.  *Poof* recidivism down 60%.  
i was thinking this..but honestly didn't want to say it cuz i know a lot of folks that are the stereotypical south park character "THEY TOOK ER JERBBBSSS"
how would making them do jobs others already do but...for cheaper make more debt pre tell .....dont worry ill wait
Alternatively, end the drug war and save billions every year.
true, but since i doubt this would happen why not try what i said legalize weed and tax it to oblivion?
First, most prisons are not federal. The revenue from your plan wouldn't make a meaningful dent in federal budget.

Second, taxing weed to oblivion is no different from keeping it illegal.
1st doesn't need to be federal to help the debt 
2nd doesn't need to make a "meaningful dent" as you seem to say 7,000,000,000 is more than enough to help rebuild roads, increase security in prisons, build houses for the people that need it while giving them par health care, or rebuild cities broke down by the recession
3 it is completely different em paying $120 for a ounce and a half now = intent to sell
me paying $200 for a ounce and a half = peace of mind and more money for the government , you sure you don't need to be in r/democrats instead ?
That's not a very good recipe to create jobs. Why hire regular people when you can hire prisoners at a discount? 

Profitable for the prison owner sure, but bad for the economy as a whole. Prisoners aren't earning much money to spend and can't spend the money they earn until released. Since a huge part of the economy relies on consumer spending, prison labor hurts the economy by reducing the number of consumers (by not hiring regular people -&gt; no job, not a consumer).

Also, it's "pray tell"
Your post said you were interested in helping the US (national) debt, which implied federal prisons. I don't know how you would go about collecting revenue from former prisoners in state and county prisons. There's no legal basis for doing so, certainly not to offset the operating costs of federal prisons.

Why would you spend the revenues of your proposal rebuilding roads or bolstering security at prisons? I thought you wanted to pay down the national debt?

Finally, taxes are functionally a form of price control. If you double the price of a good available from legitimate sources, people will seek illegitimate sources to obtain that good. There's no reason to legalize marijuana if you're going to tax it back to the black market. 
1. No they won't if they didn't that california's medical scene wouldn't be so great

2.rebuilding roads and upgrading prison security would in the long run lower debt (less accidents and medical costs for rape counseling and surgeries

3.For a prison to help the national debt it doesn't HAVE to be federal any more anywhere helps, big or small regardless if you see it that way
i never said they can't spend until they're out of a halfway house for 1
 
if the ex con is taking the jobs people don't want, the fact the unemployment rate is lowering will push customers out to buy, because people see that the employment rate is dropping they WILL spend money happened this time last year for proof just because the "good  jobs" aren't being taken doesn't mean something good isn't happening 
You say we should bill them after they get out. What money do they have to pay with. Its the same shit as a lone.
[deleted]
no, we could
1. pay them more for services while incarcerated 
2.change it to volunteer work
3.house them and have them work a low end job assigned by a state wide program and pay back in reasonable installments
I think it's more a matter of getting our money's worth when it comes to taxes.  If we were all paying 50% tax, but got a good value for it, people wouldn't be complaining.  We've already have some people paying over 50%, and we're getting crap for it.  If we're paying room &amp; board, we might as well get something in return for it.  
that's not in the OP
Yay for Ron Paul, he consistently proves that informed opinions and rational thought have no importance to American voters.
To a lot of people politics is a pageant. Bachmann knows this obviously.
She's a female, and every 'first' gets a boost.  It's how an unknown do-nothing like Obama got in, and its how Bachmann will get in.  The good news is that unlike Obama, Bachmann will probably make a great President.
Oh, like how Hilary and Palin got a boost in their primaries in 08.
Probably the same way that Mike Castle lost the Delaware primary to Christine O'Donnell, sadly.
Maybe people actually are pissed off about how big government is, and how little it does for us in return.
Did she get permission first from her husband to run, or did the voice in her head? Obama did it because he has the ability and education
This was so worth the time it took to read this entire thread. It was a very polite and well-mannered discussion, compared to the aggressive debates I am used to hearing. It left me feeling more informed about the current situation and tweaking my current perspective, which is all one can ask for. Thanks. 
Like it or not Bachmann represents the current state of the Republican party, not Paul. It sucks but that's the reality. The fundamental direction of the party needs to change before someone like Paul has a chance.

Sorry for being so late to see this, I'm new around here.

I was really just poking fun, but I do appreciate your reply. I'm not completely against a progressive tax on income like we have today, although it's not the first choice on my list. I also do not believe there should be to wide of a spread percentage-wise.

Just how do the wealthy "create jobs"? I would suggest to you that they do it in many more ways than just investing in or starting their own businesses. I personally would prefer a consumption based tax system so the 'rich' end up paying a higher percentage of their income because they have more discretionary income to spend (and we all know they love to spend it!!). A progressive tax based on choice, if you will.

I've always been good at saving though, never had the urge to "keep up with the Joneses" so to speak. So maybe it's true that people tend to favor the system which suits them best. :)

Thanks again for your reply and for not getting angry at me for the snide remark.

He's a constitutional scholar and he wrote a couple books about himself.  That's impressive I'll admit, but it doesn't demonstrate that he can be a leader.  We need a strong Christian leader with a proven background, not just an academic.

I like Bachmann and Ron Paul, but I'm really hoping Rick Perry gets the nomination.  I'll be switching my party affiliation to Republican in order to vote on Super Tuesday.  I'd advise all Democrats do the same if they want Perry or Ron Paul.  Bachmann would be a fine President if she could win, but to be honest I'm not sure she'd do well against Obama.

Ron Paul is a staunch constitutionalist and Libertarian.  Libertarian is just the modern word for Classical Liberal, which was the mindset of our Founding Fathers.  This man not only knows the constitution, he fights for it every day.  Rick Perry is the very successful and much adored governor of Texas (he's been in office since 2000).  During the last 5 years, a vast majority of America's new jobs were added in his state.  Michele Bachmann is a well known conservative congress-lady with a long background of conservative activism.  I admit I don't know as much about her as I do about Paul, but if we were limited to just those three (which I think will be the case shortly) we'll be in good shape and I'd be more than happy to vote for any of them next year.

They were both going up against a black man.  That affects their novel worth as potential first-women candidates.
Seriously?  Your question is "How"?  Welcome to America....
crazy is first, crazier in second
This doesn't answer why people would vote Bachmann over Paul. In fact, it does just the opposite.
Obama. 
The Least Incompetent.
No Republican, they just destroy their states.
Bachman's "solutions" seem to be to have it do less and less for us though, so I'm really confused by what you mean by this.
It's a matter of how much we pay vs. how much we get in return.  We're just not getting our money's worth.  

I'm OK with giving a person grocery money so they don't starve.  I'm not OK with giving the government $1,000 to give that person $100.  


It's just a theory.  But it explains why Bachmann &amp; Paul were over the others.  
I have no heart... :(
Soooooo true.
I trick or treated at her house one year, she didn't answer her door, I walked away and saw her praying.
Ron Paul. He understands the parasitic nature of the State and wants to curb it. 
Thank you for not making this a gif 
I'm sorry, but... do you have any evidence to indicate that Bachmann didn't win?  I mean, seriously.  Were there inconsistencies reported?  Did any candidate object to the results of the election?

"I didn't personally count every ballot, and I don't personally know anyone who did?" is a bit of a thin basis on which to start casting doubt on the results.
I always heard that a Democrat was a Republican that had been mugged by a another Republican who had previously been mugged by reality.
Really, you do not understand it?  First off Iowa traditionally votes the fundie tract.  Secondly, that is all who show up for the straw poll, fundies, so don't take this too seriously.  The more important should be how is the far right and/or tea party going to react, assuming she stays in front, to her moving towards the middle in order to be a viable candidate.  Will they revolt and push someone else who is already on the far right or will they compromise and choose the lesser of the two evils(whomever has the best chance to run against Obama)?
The Christian right is very similar to the old south dems. pre 1964.  They can dominate a large area of the country, but will never have a viable candidate for POTUS unless the candidate rejects a lot of the fundie ideology.  Look what it took LBJ to get to be VP then POTUS(after '64 election).  He straddled the line between southern segrationist and nationally viable dem.  He did not get into the segreation fray when he was a Senator, specifically to avoid slamming the door as a POTUS candidate.
mugception!
Under thirty republican! My new friend!
The biggest problem with Bush II is that he spent way more than he had.  The problem with Obama is that he made Bush II look extremely fiscally responsible.  The solution to inefficient government, is less government, or more efficient government.  Obama's plan seems to be to take what isn't his, so he can fund more ineffective, and wasteful government.  
Because he is a Democrat, and he is black!
That is not constructive.
I don't think any one will disagree that the debt and deficit issues the country has to deal with. 

However... isn't government spending the best way to get out of a recession? Doesn't Increased government expenditures (even made at a deficit) "pump-primes" the economy to get us at a better place?
Tell that to the Repubs, I support the man but when you boil it down those are 2 big reasons.
&gt;However... isn't government spending the best way to get out of a recession?

I am a liberal and a Dem. and I am calling this false.  This HAS NEVER worked.  It will artifically  dampen the econmic fire of recession, just like FDR, but has no chance of solving anything on it's own.  WWII single handidly solved the great depression, not FDR's programs.  What they did was provide a temporary(several years in fact) job for people and gave people hope.  In order for this to pull the country out of the depression they would have needed to be permanent jobs.  Otherwise it is basically unemployment pay where the gov't. gets a return on their pay.  it did not spark new jobs outside of ones paid for by his programs.  Tax cuts is really one of the best ways to jump start an economy.  The tax cuts however, should be targeted to benefit the ones who actually need them and are unemployed, not to the top 10%.  Supply side economics, does not work.  The problem is costs of...well everything has outpaced pay, so healthcare, gas, food, utilities are too expensive for the average middle class person.  The short term answer is stimulus, but in the long term that will not help.  Targeted tax cuts, cloing corporate tax loop holes and *wait for the shock, coming from a liberal* privatizing certain aspects of the public sector, ending wars, solving the immigration issue(the issue seems to be the ones here now, let them stay so we can move past THAT and solve the actual issue, which is the immigrants not here yet) lowering health care costs, universal healthcare with the level of care available in this country would be counter-productive since the potential levelof care would drop if healthcare were universal.  The solution is medi-care, medi-caid, and finding a way to make healthcare affordable for the rest, while not dulling the level of care with universal coverage.
But, oddly it is true....I am convinced.
Well... I agree to a point. I'd rather have an unemployment that gets a return than an unemployment that gets zero return. Plus, wouldn't a CCC give America's youth some skills that High School never gave them? 

I agree that some targeted tax cuts would work too. I think creating a "donut-hole" in the payroll taxes would go a long way to stimulate the economy. Poor people would retain more of their wage and spend more. 

I also agree that, in the words of George Bush, "voo-doo economics" doesn't work. Though, I may be wrong. 


CCC?
Civilian Conversation Corps. It was a New Deal program that took otherwise uneducated/unskilled 16-24 year olds and put them to work maintaining parks and building infrastructure. They lived in dorms in the wilderness and make decent money (The majority of it was either sent home or out of touch) they left after a year with actual skills and trades. 

With the 16-24 year old unemployment rate at 30+ percent... something like this would be amazing for the country's youth.
I agree, but what about when we have to pay for those programs down the road or when we start finding stuff to fix in order to employ people.  The gov't should not be in the business...of business, regulating yes, but not competing and becoming an industry.  Things like that and the WPA are great givers of hope and money, but if it was not for WWII we would not have the rosy pic. of FDR and his programs, people were starting to realize that while this made us feel better and helped some, it was not going to stop or reverse anything.
Okay, You're in a DeLorean... when you go back to 1936 you get hit by a lightning bolt and trade places with Roosevelt. However, in a freak occurrence with the time machine Hitler dies, WW2 averted yea! 

Now, how do you get the USA out of the Depression?

Wasn't the war was just a giant make work project? The Government just put people to work like any other WPA, CCC etc. How is building tanks any better than building infrastructure?
WWII kind of was that but, unless you were military, you were not employed by the gov't.  More people worked in the war effort on the civilian side, in private companies than served in the military.  So the gov't. made money b/c they were lent money by banks, which made money for the account holders, the gov't. then sold war bonds, which made them money to pay for the war effort.  All this money was spent on paying for war material or soldiers' pay.  So the unemployment went away over night, and the the economy was booming(as happens in every major war...unless you are losing) not b/c the gov't was paying people for work, but b/c companies were brought backto life, started and re-focused b/c the biggest customer(the US) was in the black again.  The difference being instead of creating jobs solely to pay someone by the gov't. jobs were created by industry b/c of a gov't. contract(along with military jobs).  it was a perfect storm to end a depression.  You get out of the depression without WWII the same way these things always happen, eventually the root cause it found and corrected(regulation) and then the market will correct itself.  We can speed the process up with tax cuts, social programs to help small businesses etc.  The problem now is we do not have the regulation to foster small businesses.
I don't disagree with the tax cuts and small business comment... 

However... Suppose today, the US government told GM, Ford and Chrslyer to build 100,000,000 cars each, (1 for each man woman and child in the USA) and told Alcola to build 1,000,000 tons of alunmium and told Catepillar to build 1,000,000 bulldozers. We finance these projects through "depression bonds" and follow the exact route you said that happened in WW2...

However instead of building instruments of death, were building consumer goods. Unemployment would be 0% over night too. 

We'd have the same effect of WW2, but with less death and destruction. 
Wouldn't you say that most of Obama's spending is continuation of Bush policy, such as the war?
Except, what we built in WWII was *needed* for the war effort, not simple to build something to force the gov't. to pay people.  It was capitalism, the gov't. took bids and farmed out the work, it was not told to companies to build a certain amount of X for Y dollars. Talk about gov't. waste, build 100,000,000 cars for no other reason so we can pay you?  If you artifically replace the demand with arbitrary demand, you will end the economy in a single stroke.  All value of money will be relative to what the gov't. decides it intends to pay out to people for their "work".  If that were the case, industrie would hold out to the highest dollar to perform any action, competition would disappear is going to pay.  The gov't could be held hostage for the supply of any commodity.  Besides what happens when you are paying someone to make 25 billion paperclips, b/c houses, cars, highways, hospitals have all been built?  You would have to start an entire industry just to store all this shit we do not need, or the shit we are replacing b/c we just built 100 million new ones.  An entire industry based on throwing shit away b/c we must artifically create demand.
Why does their religion factor into their ability to lead?
Looking at the current GOP candidates, it is obvious the Republicans don't possess logic.
Because they have a loony base that will show up for them on call.
They always squabble, but no matter who wins the primaries, most Republicans will just go with the party, because they really do not like Obama.
Very true. As much as I am a social conservative as well as a fiscal one, harping on those social issues does not help the republicans for the purposes of getting elected. Social issues are too polarizing for the independents who are swayed left by the extremism of conservatism
"The" war?  Which one?  The two he inherited, or the three he created?  

Not for the stimulus bill.  He hasn't actually done much good with that, when he's been in charge of where it goes.  That being said, he added the stimulus to his bottom line of his budget.  If we held spending back to Bush levels, by their math they would have cut several trillion.  What Bush did was spend too much, what Obama did was make Bush look fiscally responsible.
Best way to get out of a recession is to get rid of what caused it.  We were deficit spending before all of this, the solution is not more deficit spending.  

The solution is to bring back manufacturing.  Consider how things would be different if a factory was looked at as job production instead of the CO2 of the building being looked at as killing the world.  

Bring back manufacturing.  Not everyone can work in an office building.  
It helps to have a representative that is either like the people, or pretends that he is like the people.

I mean, that's the whole idea - if you're an athiest you're going to want, among the other qualifications, someone who isn't overtly religious.

Being a member of the religious majority, we tend to vote for people like Perry.  

As for Perry, I'm beginning to have my doubts because of his Democratic past - he was campaign chairman for Al Gore in his 1988 bid for the White House - it's been over 20 years, but anyone who's supported Al Gore is going to at least be 180 degrees diametrically opposed to what it is I'm looking for.  That's quite a change for a man even in two decades.

The circumstances of the oft-celebrated Texan job reports also bothers me (low wage jobs paid for with stimulus money) hints that maybe Perry is full of shit and no different from Obama.

I... also don't want another Bush.  I think I'm willing to stay home next November if Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination.  I won't vote for Obama, but at the same time, I won't vote for someone potentially worse just to be spiteful.

edit: I voted for Obama in 2008.  At the time I was living in section 8 housing and using food stamps while working part time at the university I attend.  In addition to that, I also relied on public transportation.  I was totally on the government dole for every need, and I didn't see the problem with it right away.

Then Obama's plans fell apart and along with it the economy.  I learned some things about conservatism and changed my ways.  I gave up section 8 housing, I gave up food stamps, and I have a second job working for a general contractor.  I bought Ron Paul's book: Liberty Defined, started watching Fox News (in place of MSNBC), Ayn Rand's The Fountain Head, and discussed politics more with a very conservative friend of mine.  Recently, I've begun looking at The Right Network.

Long story short, while I have embraced conservatism, I'm not going to hop on the first candidate I see either.  IMO, Paul is a bit 'out there' but at least he's consistent and honest.  I'd rather have him than anyone else at this point.  And if not him, I'll sit at home.
Interesting debate. 

I'm from the UK - and my knowledge of the US economy is bad. However, I guess it's a case of simple supply and demand economics and I would say on a macro level it is important for the "developed" nations i.e. the ones with expensive work forces, to look very closely at what is needed in the world. 

I would assume that for at least the next 10 years, countries such as the US and UK will not be able to on-shore many manufacturing activities (and in theory get people into jobs) from countries where it is cheaper to make the goods (or tat, as it often is) that the consumer (and indeed many other sectors) need - so governments need to come up with viable ideas (and I use that word instead of policies) that are to a certain extent future proof or futuristic, in order that the developed economies have a relevant output that can be sold to the rest of the world (to put it very simplistically.) 
What three wars did Obama create? I know were in Libya... but where else? (honest question, no snark) 

What do you think would happen to the GDP if we cut or held back Govt. spending? 

GDP=C+I+G, government spending is an important of the countries GDP, I am afraid that by cutting back spending during such a fragile time in our economy, we'll fall back into recession and probably go into depression. 


That is not constructive, either. 
&gt;"The" war? Which one? The two he inherited, or the three he created?

It's cute how the GOP likes to say Obama started 3 wars. I assume you are talking about Pakistan, Yemen, and Libya.  How many U.S. deaths have occurred in these wars?  NATO airstrikes in Libya are few and far between and the airstrikes in Yemen and Pakistan have been going on for more than 6 years.  The operations in Pakistan resulted in OBL.

Obama added some spending but added less spending than Bush added.  The stimulus should have been much larger but congress didn't allow it. It would have been more effective if Obama didn't cave and try to meet the GOP in the middle.  What keeps happening is that Obama keeps trying to meet the GOP in the middle and when he gets to the middle, they scoot over to the right a little more and give him the finger.

They fucked the economy even worse and the U.S.'s AAA rating with their debt ceiling politics.
While I agree with most of what you say, the Cash for Clunkers program was the only thing I could get behind w/ the stimulus package, because if managed properly (It wasn't) it would of increased spending on new vehicles, stimulating the economy, get shitty cars off the road, increasing general safety and gas mileage, and keep people employed producing new cars and recycling the old. Unfortunately like the rest of the stimulus package, the vast majority of the money was lost in red tape and figuring out the best way to effectively run the program, rather than just running the stupidly simple program.
I agree with you completely. Even so it doesn't matter who won in Iowa because it was a poll. It does not have any guaranteed effect on the 2012 election.
[deleted]
Bachmann has a lot of appeal to the regular person. Especially in her home state of Iowa. She did a good job at appearing very appealing to the voters. Keep in mind this does not mean I agree with her political views.
How does she appeal to the regular person? She pulls stuff out of her ass and dogmatically says them. She is dumb as hell, she never checks her facts.
There are no Republican ideas for bringing back manufacturing.
Doesn't capture his delivery.
Dream on.
You're lucky you didn't get a restraining order against you.
No, because if they do, we'll never learn anything about any of their ideas.
Except all of them.  What are the democrat ideas?
*Tax rates* are not equivalent to *compliance rates*.
So if it's not war, and they're not U.S. deaths, then it's not murder?

Obama added some spending but added less spending than Bush added?
http://xkcd.com/285/
Pakistan, Yemen, Syria.  

Government spending doesn't go into the GDP.  There's the GDP, the government taxes off of it.  

Let's cut back the waste.  There are programs doing more damage than good.  There are redundant programs.  The government doesn't need to take $1,000 from me, pay off it's bureaucrats, buy off it's people, then give me $10.  Just don't take my $1,000 to begin with.  It's much easier.   
http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/07/24/opinion/sunday/24editorial_graph2/24editorial_graph2-popup.gif 

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/images/CBPPpublicdebt.jpg
But suppose you don't spend your $1,000... By not purchasing anything, the GDP goes down $1,000, yea? 

If the Gov't taxes you $1,000 and pays bureaucrats, don't those bureaucrats spend the money they're paid? That increases the GDP too, right?
I would be interested in hearing why you would like to privatize the public programs? I seriously think this is a bad idea. Not because I think the Gov't would do a better job, but because I feel corporations are (more) corrupt and have no accountability for screwing people.

How much is Libya costing us?
thanks for this. i never thought of this as positive.
I don't think one should think in a manner like that, I believe its counter-productive to say: I have an idea, the other guy doesn't have one, so mine must be right. 

What are all the Republican ideas that will encourage domestic manufacturing? 

(in an extreme case, I suppose if we eliminate the EPA and the USDA and the minimum wage, we can compete with the cheap labor costs found in Red China. But, I hope no one in the USA would actually advocate turning back 100 years of environmental and social progress)
this is not necessarily untrue. extreme thinking yes.
How much are these extra-national excursions costing us when compared to the Afghanistan and Iraq (part 2) wars?

On a tangent... isn't the government spending on the military contracts building tomahawk missles helping the economy? How many jobs depend on people building and designing them??
No.  It stays the same.  I already made the $1,000.  That being said I invest my $1,000.  

It's my money.  I don't need to over pay a bureaucrat when they could be doing something to actually help people.  

Take a field.  It's worth a field.  Lets say you grow corn on it.  You've increased the GDP by the value of the corn.  Or lets say you put a factory on it.  You're increasing the GDP by what you're producing.  We don't increase the GDP by pushing paper.  We increase the Gross Domestic Product by producing things domestically.  
Well then why aren't we advocating going into every nation with a dictator knocking off dissidents?
Hmmm... 

I dont want to say you're wrong, but isn't GDP defined as: GDP = Private consumption + investment + government spend?
You don't need to eliminate things like the EPA.  You need to bring back the manufacturing to the US.  To do so, you have to take away or undo that which made it go away in the first place.  

Social progress?  What do you mean by that?  
An 8 hour work day, sick days, OSHA. These things make us less competitive for labor as compared to other nations, if we were to eliminate this progress, companies will be quicker to build manufacturing plants 

What is causing domestic manufacturing to leave the USA?
I think you might be right on how they calculate it.  But it's kinda how the "unemployment" rate isn't people unemployed.  It'll still be the GDP if the government wastes it, or I spend it on beer, strippers, or responsible things.  The bigger questions are:
1.) Can the government do more for me with my $1,000 than I can?
2.) Does it have the right to?
It would certainly boost the economy, eh? 

All military is socalized spending. I would rather use the 600 Billion military budget dollars building dams and highway overpasses and a high speed rail from Los Angels to Las Vegas. For some reason that social spending is wrong, but the social spending building bullets and bombs and warships is right. 


I just had this conversation the other day. I absolutely think welfare needs to be reformed. Someone earlier mentioned know people who wanted to have more kids to get more money from government. This enrages me. The program should have stipulations. Such as how you can spend the money, where etc. Also, it needs to have a cut off point. Exceptions can be made, but if you make no effort to better yourself why keep supporting these people? 
The second question asked is an easy answer: yes, absolutely every right. If it weren't for the government we wouldn't have nice things like roads and interstate freeways, Embassies and Ambassadors, A postal service, Water ways and Canals, and tons of other things. 


The first question is a good question... Can the government spend the money better than a private person??? I believe that an individual can spend $1,000 better for himself than the federal government can. But would that individual spend the money the best way to help society and the long term growth of the nation?



 
Why can't you build and run a factory in the US?
I like this idea. I worry the political process has become so expensive the "common man" doesnt have a chance to get elected.
I like this idea too.
They're trying high speed rail in CA.  They said it would be $10,000,000,000 over 10 years.  But they blew through that in under two years, and we're not closer to actually having it.  


What are your thoughts on those who have little to know annual income? Specifically I am thinking of the issues Buffett has brought up.
I don't have the entrepreneurial ability, nor the capital or the leverage to build one. 
Personally, I think that for anyone to become Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, they should have to have served in them first, as it gives him or her a better perspective when deploying us.  That's why I'm not sure who'll I'll vote for in the coming election, no one is really jumping out at me.  That being said, as a service member, I respect the office of the President and will not flat out bash any sitting President.
So, because of one failure we have to stop everything? 

Is or is not a rail line from LA to Las Vegas a good thing? Because we blew through $10B does that mean it is no longer a good thing? If the I-15 were to fail, should we not re-build the freeway?
I know I'm a little late to this one, but here I go.  

With the recent debt ceiling debacle, I feel like Congress was like an employee at a company.  Said employee spent too much money and went off his budget.  Instead of reining in his spending, he went to his employer to demand a raise.  Congress works for us.  No one would go to their boss and ask for a raise just so they can be irresponsible with their money.

Also, I worked my ass off to earn every cent I have (put myself through college with no help from family, etc), and don't understand why it should go to social programs for people who don't.
Hmmm... I don't disagree with you're argument... but if we follow that logic, we cant have anyone be the head of the FBI who isn't an LEO, or be the head of the USDA without being a Health guy, or be the head of NASA with out being an astronaut. The president is the head of all these executive departments as he is the head of the executive branch of government. 

Also, Jimmy Carter was a submariner as was Nixon as a Naval passenger control officer... how does that give good insight when committing land troops in Central Asia?

Do you also feel that the Secretary of Defense should have been in the service too?
No, it was a bad idea to begin with, and it's still a bad idea.  There's mountains where there's a demand, and no demand on flat areas.  

The I-15 by comparison, works.  
If you did, what obstacles are in one's way?
Lol, well... not that well when one drives home hung over Sunday morning in terrible traffic. 

The Cajon pass is the hardest part. 

Did you know that 2 years ago there was zero demand for tablet computers? or 100 years ago zero demand for Air travel? just because there is currently no demand or infrastructure doesn't mean something is a waste of money. 
That's a hard question to answer. I suppose the biggest obstacle would be two fold... is there enough demand for my product and how can I get a decent return on investment. Well... ROI over risk is probably the only things considered. 
I understand what you mean, but to be honest this is not a fair nor accurate analogy.  While it is true that austerity in the government would shrink the debt on paper, cutting back on social programs that would educate and put to work the unemployed would hurt the country in the long term by locking people into their current level of education or income.  The way our nation was able to beat our last major economic crisis in 1929 was through massive government spending.

True, the deficit was huge in the short term, but the jobs created and improved infastructure led to a stronger nation emerging with a well educated and highly employed populace.  

Also, the spending being reigned is leading to students having to pay interest as they go through school instead of deferring it to when they graduate, making it even harder to work their way through.

While it's great that *you* worked to put yourself through college, and *you* are doing fine, and *you* didn't get any help and didn't need it, doesn't mean that *everybody* is in the same situation and able to do so.

As far as making budget cuts goes, I don't understand why defense is so sacred.  We could probably spend less than half of what we currently spend and have an adequate military.    For that matter, why do soldiers and their families get free healthcare for life?  It's pracitcally Socialism, a word conservatives curse with!  While I **definitely** think wounded vets should have free medical attention for life as well as those with PTSD, someone who was in the drum and bugel corps doesn't need my tax money to pay for their son's tennis injury.  

Cutting the budget is fine.  I don't like it, but I'll admit it will fix problems short term.  However, cutting education funding should never be an option, especially in a world where asome form of college degree is near manditory for employment.

Also, on the issue of taxes, the "tax increases" suggested by Democrats actually *decrease* the tax that you or I would pay, and increases it on people who are more well off and able to afford it (like [Warren Buffett](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html) ).  I see people vehemently opposing tax reform that would increase their income because a rich politician convinced them to.

I understand wanting to limit government, but I don't understand doing so at the expense of your own income.  In essence, the current conservative stance on taxes (from a working class point of view) is as such: "The government needs less income, so I'll sacrifice a disproportionately large amount of my own money to make sure it doesn't!".  I don't know about you, but I'd be cool with the government having more money if I get to keep a larger proportion of mine while rich people shoulder the burden.  

Thanks for your comment, and please keep the discussion alive!

Exactly! No one who isn't already deeply tied to the corruption in politics can get elected to anything but a school board, and even then they have to kiss the ass of every stay-at-home mom in a 5 mile radius.
I think the problem isn't that they remain supported, but rather that they are *only* supported.  Welfare throws money at a problem that can only be fixed with education.  

Give a man a fish, feed him one day.  Teach a man to fish, feed him for the rest of his days.
I do think that the SecDef should have been in the service too. I don't have much of an opinion on the head of the FBI or the USDA, but when you tell soldiers that they're going to have 15 month deployments, I feel that a former soldier will understand what that means and only commit us to that if absolutely necessary. A civilian may not understand the hardship stress that deployments are on a soldier and his family.  For instance, although I certainly did not agree with all his positions, I do think McCain would have had a better understanding of what the long wars are doing to morale in the military.
I think a large part of people's problem with the Obama administration is his skin color.   Now I'm not saying this as a rabble rouser.

Think about it, Clinton was more liberal, and more active as a president, but he didn't recieve half of the backlash.  Also, Obama's harshest critics in the newly taken over Tea Party infer their dissatisfaction with his heritage by constantly referencing his Kenyan ancestery and linking him with Islam when he's been a Christian his whole life.  Also, never in the history of American politics has the "public" demanded a birth certificate from the President.

Obama is different, and he is a manifestation of the changes in society that racists are most afraid of.  

Now, the above is more applicable to the socially conservative right (who have taken over the Tea Party).  Unfortunately, the fiscal conservatives who dislike Obama for muscling in the healthcare bill and other reasonable reasons, are drowned out by hate speech.  

While I myself am a liberal, I do not deny the values of fiscal conservativism and their importance in balancing our political stage.  However, the hatred of Obama is more of a social phenomenon rather than a reaction to policy, in my humble opinion.

By the way, thank you for posting another constructive thread! Feel free to "steal" as much as you want.  The idea is to start a dialogue that sheds light on everyone's views and concerns, encourage your friends to do the same :)
I'd say that most people who really put their minds to it could put themselves through college. I'll admit, my dad's a doctor, and I was raised well off.  My husband was raised in a tiny apartment outside of Chicago just above the poverty line, but has two bachelors and is working on his masters.

I see far too much abuse of the welfare system for me to support it.  Yes, it is necessary.  However, it's not necessary when you have seven kids and expect taxpayers to support you and your children.  

I'll agree, defense needs to be cut.  You're wrong about healthcare for life in the military though; you're eligible while active duty, and if you retire (spend more than 20 years active duty).  After you retire, you have to pay into it like any other health care plan to be eligible.  Although it is pretty comprehensive, it's no Cadillac plan.

Military could definitely be cut. Simply ending the wars would save an insane amount of money.  Right now, because of the economy, there's a 10 month wait to get into boot camp.  I feel that I'd prefer people to be in the military earning money, rather than collecting unemployment benefits, as they're doing something useful and also learning marketable skills in the Army.


How's amtrak doing?

And don't drive hungover.  It's against the law.  
Have you ever tried to build something in California?
Once again, I don't disagree. But... I think there is some flaw in that logic. 

Jimmy Carter served. So, he should be fit to be CIC, yea? But, how does kickin' in a air conditioned submarine, with an ice creme machine available on demand, help him understand what a 15 month deployment means?

McCain served in Viet-nam... so he knows what war time is like. But, would a peacetime soldier, who put 3 years in and and the farthest he got deployed was Hawaii, be able to understand wartime deployment? 

How would this soldier or Jimmy Carter be able to better understand what it means to be deployed over a civilian?
I think you make a salient point. Obama is really middle of the road socially and economicly. In fact more moderate/to the right of Clinton. His policies are not the classic "liberal progressive" that I want...

Perhaps it isn't because the color of his skin, but the Republican Party has moved more to the right in the last ten years and that is what is causing the backlash?
Amtrak has many issues that makes it hard to compare to anything. Amtrak does not own the right-of-way on the tracks. Slower moving Freight takes priority. 

But, I love to take the train places. I consider it part of the vacation. It takes a day to get to Albuquerque and 2 to go to chicago, but... its part of the adventure. Its the same cost as the plane too. 
Other than sandcastles in the sand, no.

This is a glimpse.  
Submarine life is far more difficult than you make it out to be. 90 days without seeing the sun?  

It's difficult to explain to a civilian, but in boot camp/ROTC/service academies, they drill into us certain values.  We learn that "Never leave a man behind" cannot actually be followed if it's detrimental to the mission.  Our loyalty is to the Constitution above all.  I have far more faith in someone who's been through this training than someone who was a "community organizer" and I have no idea what sort of ethics classes he took.  
Lol, who is to say I am a civilian? Though, I do get what you're saying. 

But can't a person get Honor, Courage, Commitment (navy core values) though other means? 

Not talking bad about service members, but I've personally know scumbags that served in the Navy and Marine Corps... Because they've gone to a service academy doesn't mean they aren't scum. Lol, I generally don't like those ring knockers from Annapolis.

I was in a fraternity in college, there they drilled into us Fellowship, Scholarship, Leadership and Service. Should I expect GDI's (non-fraternity people) to not have those values?

Honest question, It doesn't look like the republicans are going to nominate a person with a military background, and Obama isn't facing a primary challenge. Would you vote for a 3rd party military background candidate before you vote for a non-veteran Republican or Obama?
It depends on who the 3rd party candidate is.  I'm not very inspired by anyone I see running right now.  I kind of feel a vote for a third party is a throwaway vote, so I'm not sure I'll vote at all.  I know my perspective would probably be different if I wasn't military.  I just feel that if a military man sends us into action, he cares a little more about getting everyone home and giving us the equipment necessary to do so, compared to someone who's never been there.

I'm in a sorority, my husband's in a fraternity, and I know the way the military teaches the values is completely different.  Six weeks of nothing but them yelling at you, plus we all take various leadership and ethics classes.
I might buy that argument if the entire defense budget wasn't less than EITHER SS or Medicare/caide.  
Teaching someone to dig a hole and then fill it in isn't teaching them anything, for one.

For two, how many upper-middle-class comparative literature majors do you think are going to volunteer for this absolute menial labor job program you are proposing?  For that matter, how many high school kids are going to take this job when they know an illegal Mexican will do it for half minimum wage and they can be a barista at Starbucks?
And yet that's basically how his base chooses to characterize anyone who criticizes him.....
tl;dr: Obama is a fucking black
Summary: Obama is a fucking black
Because only white christian can be a true blue Republican. If you are a Hindu or an atheists yet claim to be a Republican, no one will take your intelligence seriously.
[deleted]
I totally respect your opinion. I think that the president's role as Commander in Chief is one of his/hers more minor functions. I personally place greater value on his/her's ideas and progressive stance on issues. 

A third party is never a throwaway vote, It is a vote for a candidate that more better represents your values. I think the country would be better off if we didn't treat governing the country as a zero-sum game. That if I don't win, I lose and I have to vie for every advantage over the other guy.  
True, ditch digging isn't teaching them much. But, it does teach cooperation and how to deal with people. Develops a work ethic and an appreciation for the Majesty of the country. 

Upper-middle class Comp. Lit. majors make-up so few people of the population that their impact is negligible. I'm talking about the hundreds of thousands of people out there that don't have the privilege of college or middle class upbringing. 

The unemployment rate for degreed youth is 4.5% the unemployment rate for youth with out a college education is nearly 20%. Plus only 30% of people in the USA have a degree. So of young people 70% dont have a degree, and of those 1/5 are unemployed. 

There were other New Deal programs that helped starving Comp. Lit majors too. Depression era art work is amazing, and the government commissioned many pieces of work all around the country. Why not do that again? Comp. Lit. majors can write copy for the new CCC advertisements. 
That is an interesting report. I wished it pointed out specific programs and regulations. The report says that regulation costs business in California about 500 billion dollars. 

But, Does this regulation add 500 Billion dollars of value to California? Does it add 500 Billion to the quality of life for the current residents here and for future generations? I know that some regulation is silly and pointless, but I would bet that there are good reasons for enacting some of this regulation. 

We don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water... 

I personally think that Prop. 13 is the devil and one of the major causes for the falling out that is occurring in California. It limits a structured and predictable tax base for counties and cities. Property tax is the life blood of a city, and by paying tax on the 1970's value of a house and commercial property severely limits the services that a city can provide. Things like firemen and librarys and schools.
I didn't realize that Obama created medicare and social security.
Well not every party can have a leader as gifted as obama trolol.
&gt;True, ditch digging isn't teaching them much. But, it does teach cooperation and how to deal with people. Develops a work ethic and an appreciation for the Majesty of the country.

I completely agree, but I'm pretty sure that given the attitudes of both teenagers and the parents of teenagers now, you won't get people interested.  About 5 years ago, I was working in the admissions office of the college I went to, and we had parents who had literally filled out the entire application *for* their kids.  In the days of the CCC, families pretty much had kids to spare.  Now, we've got "Mother's special little angel" in spades.
LOL, I think we're witnessing the fall of our civilization. Helicopter parents filling out college applications, its ridiculous! We have adults still living at home because it is easy. I learned so much being on my own and getting roommates. I will never move back with my folks, even if it means flipping burgers or slinging tacos. 

My buddy is a professor at a small college in Ohio (OSU) He's taken calls from parents about homework, missing class and test scores. One day a parent drove to his office to explain that her daughter was sick and couldn't make it to class. 

Sometimes I think we should bring back the draft. But, instead of drafting young people into the service, we force them to join something like the CCC or AmeriCorps. A couple years of digging ditches and public service will help the poor because they'll have a job and get skills, and help the more well-to-do kids because it'll break the "Mother's special little angel" mentality. 
It does not add $500,000,000,000 of value.  If I try to run a farm, how does sending me a bill for $500,000,000,000 help me?

Do you know why they passed Prop 13?  Because they were wasting money, ran out, then kept raising property taxes on people to where they lost their homes.  

So lets take the Cal State university example.  10 years ago the ratio of administrators to teachers was around 1:5.  This last year we just passed 1.1:1, there are more people pushing papers than actually doing work.  No one can give me a good answer as to why.  Those other people aren't adding value to the service they're offering, they're just adding cost.  

The current big problem is unemployment.  People aren't "doing" anything productive, we just have the government "creating jobs" by having 15 people do the job of 1.  That doesn't create value, that just adds cost.  You keep hearing about how "the rich need to pay their fair share of the burden", but that's a burden that doesn't need to be there.  

Tax gasoline for example.  Next time at the pump calculate how much tax is added to it.  You could get a gallon for under $3 if you didn't have to pay the tax on it.  Now think that the government is getting $1 for every gallon of gas in every car.  That is a MASSIVE amount of money.  They blew through that in the blink of an eye.  So now they want 10% of everything you make, feds want 10% after that, and they want 10% of everything you spend.  They want a few percent of your car's worth every year, also with your house.  They tax your driver's license.  

They tax your alarm clock, they tax the power to run your alarm clock.  They tax the room you're in, they tax you for the street you take.  They tax you for your toothbrush, your toothpaste and the water you use.  They tax your shower, they tax your clothes, they tax your breakfast, they tax you getting to work, they tax you at work.  They tax you when you get home, they tax you when you get into bed. 

I don't mind paying taxes, I just want to get my money's worth.  
I think the 500 B is an aggregate of all the costs of regulations applied to business... an individual farm probably doesn't get hit with much. I am sure some of the regulation deal with water run off and other pollutants. Things that cost money now, but will prevent the farmland from turning into a wasteland in a few generations. 

I make more than 75% of all people and more than 50% of all households. ($50,000 a year) Yet I only paid 3.2% of my income to State taxes. ($1,601 in 2010) and 10% in Federal taxes ($5025) (I own no property, have zero kids so my only deductions were the personal and standard) 

Sure, Living in LA county my purchases are taxed at about 10%, and the way CA calcuates gasoline tax is tricky (they tax the federal excise tax you pay too) But, I hardly pay anything in taxes! Honestly, I wish they would raise fuel taxes more, as it would drive (heh) more people to use and demand mass transit. I already use busses and the light rail to get about the city. I take the train to LAX and the Bus to LGB. 

I feel like I should be taxed more so that society can provide more services to my countrymen. It not costs over $6,000 a year to go to college at CSULB! a decade ago it was about $2,000! California, Please tax me more to provide affordable schooling! 

I don't disagree that things can be more efficient. But what function do those new administrators at the CSU system do? Are they administrating make work programs where one digs a ditch and the other fills it up? Or do they add value to the system? I do not know. But I am sure that most of those new Administrators aren't fake jobs for the Chancellors sister. 

No, it's less than $500,000,000,000 per farm.  It's not a Regulation/No Regulation argument.  It's Good Regulation/Bad Regulation argument.  Look at the dust bowl and 30% unemployment in Central CA.  

They don't need to tax you more.  I mean you can go ahead and send them a extra check.  Nothing stopping you.  School costs went up because more people are doing less work.  

Do you have any evidence that shows they're accomplishing more work with these extra administrators?  
Yes, your point is what I was trying to get across. How about work outreach programs? Have others who have gotten off welfare help those on the program. Education, new skills... anything. My grandmother made good money working Nabisco but because her unemployment $ was so much, it hurt her to work. So for 5-6 out of the yr she sat around the house. She wanted to work, but financially it hurt her more.
Lol, Do you have any evidence that they aren't accomplishing more work with the extra administrators?
Where is this more work that they've accomplished?

Budget:

412,000 students

I see your point, there are more administrators and now fees are going up. But these things don't exist in a vacuum and correlation does not imply causation. 
The straw poll was a paid vote, it cost 30 dollars
This is why Washington created the presidential cabinet so he could ask experts their opinions on matters and give him advice. Hitler was a corporal in the German army before becoming chancellor. He ran his army into the ground because he didn't listen to his army command. FDR, I think it is safe to say, listened to his generals and everything went well. Bush didn't listen when his top brass said they needed more troops for the invasion of Iraq to secure things like ammo dumps which insurgents later raided and used to help cause the debacle we're in now.
TL;DR experience in the army before becoming the president matters for jack shit.
I don't even have any evidence to prove she has a brain. 
Bachmann PAID for the tickets of 6000 people who attended the Straw Poll. Many of those people voted for her.
I voted for Obama in the primaries and penciled in my father for the general election, by that time I was sick of Obama (Was mostly a vote against Clinton and then he picked her up anyway). This time around I think I am going to register republican (currently "Decline to State") and vote Ron Paul in the primaries at least.  I think his presidency would bring an interesting change, for the better? Who knows...
I am a practicing Muslim convert of 5 years. I went "Decline to State" for a few years, but it appears I may be coming back to the Reep side after the dust settled from the Bush years.

The most egalitarian tax system of all is property tax...  here in Texas, we have no income tax, and everyone pays the same rate of property tax (whether directly due to owning a home, or indirectly via part of their rent).  Your question illustrates precisely why income taxes, started by Progressives, are EXACTLY NOT to provide for social equality as advertised... they only burden people who are trying to move up the socio-economic ladder.  Ad-valorem taxes are how we made it until 1913, when they started collecting income tax.
What is wrong with socialism? I think it takes a lot of narcissism to go into politics, how is obama's worse?

GWB was the first MBA president, so basically the 41 before him had no finance or business background. How is that a bad thing? Clinton was a lawyer, bush was a patrician spy, reagean was an actor, Carter worked on nuclear submarines, how is a finance background important for a president?

I take it you believe the poor should receive no benefits, ya? So what should you have society do with those that require federal assistance to eat? 

You are right that 50% of people don't pay taxes... But how many of then are seniors that have zero income? Or the disabled that dont work either? But also realize that the average income is like 30,000 a year. That means lots of people only make about 10,000 a year. With your personal and standard deduction, you wouldn't pay any taxes. 
Why do you think it is important that the president goes to church? Is it important want flavor of christinaty it is? Are catholics or orthodox okay? How about a Jewish president that goes to temple? Is it just a person of faith that you desire to be president or just a Christian? 
I like that about him too. I don't agree with all of his views, but I like his style for sure. Not just flowery speeches, but stubborn logic.
Are you worried about Trump's economic failures (aside from his successes) when you are hoping for his return?
[deleted]
So the difference between him and Ron Paul is (in your view) Ron Paul's "crazy" comments?
[deleted]
A little late to the party here, but I'll throw in my 2 cents.

I don't think that anything in the previous post is true. Clinton was certainly not "more liberal" than Obama, and yet he received a ton more backlash. I hate to throw in the age issue, but there's a good chance that many on Reddit weren't actually old enough to be politically aware during Clinton's presidency, and really have no way to compare. But never mind Clinton, the criticism of Obama is NOTHING when you compare what Ronald Reagan or George Bush went through. 

Also, the Tea Party is concerned with fiscal responsibility, and has no stand on Obama's birth certificate or religion. Projecting these views on them is more of a Rorschach test of the people viewing them rather than on the Tea Party itself.

Saying that people don't like Obama because of racism is just lazy and unimaginative. Certain people simply can't conceive that other people have views that differ from theirs, and have to justify the dissonance somehow in their mind. Kind of like, "Nobody could possibly reject Obama's ideas on their merits, so they must be racists! That's the only explanation!"
yes and no, there is a difference between crazy comments, (ron paul and rick perry, who need to think before they speak), and donald trump (witty yet chooses the correct words).  One of the few Conservative billionaires who are willing for their taxes to be raised.  
what would be your solution?
The average person is dumb as hell and the average person never checks her facts.

He's great, consistent, uncompromising.  The last trait- probably a bit much.

Economically he's a sound candidate, but he'll lay us bare for another terrorist attack, allow Iran to develop nuclear bombs, and possibly even let them over-run Israel.

You could say we have it coming and that we need to stop the cycle of violence somehow - but I doubt anyone here would say that.  I like him, and I'm willing to take that risk, so he has my vote.

Whether or not we're ready for him remains to be seen.  But mark my words, Rick Perry is another Bush Jr.  He is pretending to be a conservative because he thinks we're stupid and will fall for it.  He will destroy us.
It's so funny how much gets attributed the President.  I don't ever remember him taking personal credit for killing Osama? Please link to a legitimate source.  I didn't see him getting flown out to an air-craft carrier with a "Mission Accomplished" sign in the middle(or really beginning) of a war we are still in because of his "narcissism".

No man is perfect, nor is Obama.  And the reference to our founding fathers? Our founding fathers took away the freedoms of the indigenous people of America, so they could get away from their problems in Great Britain. They had slaves too, so I don't think of them and get a woody like a lot of "patriots".

They built a great system though, that at one point had checks against minority rule.  Also had ways to evolve when the people of the country evolved.  Unfortunately today's system isn't the same, and the rulers aren't playing by the rules.  Greed has entered the system and poisoned the minds of all of our leaders.  They've lied so much, that they believe the lies.  

Until all American's realize that we must all live on this earth together, share it and work on laws that benefit all - then we are lost.  But instead the masses are being led by the few, which are getting rich as fuck while the poor fight among themselves..
I haven't seen him take responsibility for a single bad thing he has done. First and foremost , the out of control spending. He often blames Bush for the economy and says he inherited all of the problems. Yes , it is true that he inherited a hefty debt , but he has added to that debt significantly. Charts show that Bush spent 1.6 billion dollars a day. Obama spends 6.1 billion dollars a day. He has spent more in 3 years , than bush did in 8. His plans are ass , and the plans he does have , are all created behind closed doors by a few people , instead of using the ...you know....CONGRESS , the people we VOTED to do that job. He didn't make a budget plan for 2 years , yet once again pointed fingers towards republicans , saying they were "holding the economy hostage". What happened to the 2 years he had to make a plan ? He took military action in Libya without the consent on congress and now he is FORCING a Leader of another country to step down. Police state much ? That is only a few of my gripes.

For the record , i am in no way a liberal hater. Obama just strikes me as the worst president to be in office since jimmy carter. 
upvoted because it's the truth. and at least 14 republicans downvoted, so i felt the need to upvote as a democrat.

I think that him switching from a strictly libertarian to a republican pursuit so that he can actually have a chance makes him appear weak. He's been trying to get the presidency for so long, he just looks silly now.
[deleted]
This is parading around and exhibiting a since of self entitlement... http://bit.ly/j9XYE0

It's so funny how he claimed that we prevailed, but still left the war hanging for his successor to finish...

The maintream media hates him, I love him by default. 
Vote for Ron Paul. 
Your mention of Iran over-running Israel, why is it our responsibility, from a libertarian perspective, to protect another sovereign nation?
That is what attracted me to his cause as well.
&gt;But, I hope no one in the USA would actually advocate turning back 100 years of environmental and social progress

Have you paid no attention to the Tea Party or something?
&gt;Economically he's a sound candidate, but he'll lay us bare for another terrorist attack

In the past 16 years, an average of 200 Americans a year have died from terrorist attacks (Oklahoma, 9/11, the Muslim Major). Are 200 lives a year worth the loss of liberty and the expense that is the war on terror? Terrorist attacks are rare, unpredictable and disastrous. But the point is that they're rare - for comparison, 200 a year is the number of Americans killed annually by paracetamol.

&gt;allow Iran to develop nuclear bombs

What, as President, could he do to prevent that anyway? Plus, it's not as if the US is the only country that doesn't want that to happen.

&gt;and possibly even let them over-run Israel.

That's Israel's own damn problem, not mine.

&gt;He's great, consistent, uncompromising. The last trait- probably a bit much.

You're probably not wrong there. I picture a Ron Paul presidency as just being presidential veto after presidential veto.

What would be interesting if Paul wins the nomination is how Obama will react. As a libertarian, he's effectively socially liberal on several issues, with two big ones being the wars and drug policy reform. I suspect Obama will have to push left on the social issues front and right somewhat fiscally (which you could argue he already did). The social conservatives were never going to vote for him anyway, and they'll despise Paul even more.

I personally think socially liberal, fiscally conservative policies are exactly what America needs right now. Pitting Obama against Paul is the first step towards that.
&gt;What is wrong with socialism? It goes against our freedom that our founding fathers fought for.

Exactly how does it do that? Which freedoms specifically? How are the founding fathers relevant? 

Why are you using "socialist" as a perjorative term? All it really is is the belief that the state can do some things better than the private sector. Like defence, policing, schooling and healthcare.

&gt;I do not believe any president should have their hand in the dealings with our economy. Just like our founding fathers had made it so adamant about when forming OUR Constitution.

Which bit of the Constitution is that?

&gt;Remember Soviet Russia? Remember China before it opened to foreign trade? How about North Korea? Do you want to live in a society where you are told what you are going to do for the rest of your life? I sure don't.

There are socialist countries other than Third World socialist countries. Like most of Europe.
I need to look into how the French government can afford to pay for that before saying. I can say this about the American system. It is flawed. Too many people spend their entire lives on the welfare system and dont do shit. They lay around their houses eat their free food in their free government funded house. I agree with you that it would be great that the system could pay for college, I am starting my final year of college and have worked the entire time while attending and I am 20,000 in debt, which isnt bad compared to alot of people I know.

tl;dr: the system would work but it needs to be overhauled big time. Get the lazy people off welfare. 
to be completely honest the cost are of course a bit impredictible some sometime we need to pay more and some time less, but the system work since the end of the war, so if it can survive the retirment of old baby boomer, I would say it's quite robust.

it comes with quite heavy taxes, of course.

as for people who live on welfare all their lives, there some of course (and by that, i mean people who don't actualy need it) but as we have a minimum salary not to shady (and again, heavy taxes) and everybody have at least some education, it's more advantageous to work in pratically every situation. also a lot a help are dependent of tangible proof that you are looking for a job. 
I can't agree with the libertarian perspective on that.  Oft-alleged Zionism aside, we are committed to defend them like any other ally.  Changing this would bring into question our commitment to defend other allies.
We were concerned when India was developing nuclear bombs and an ally of the Soviet Union.  Now we aren't.

What course of action (or non-action) promotes the security of both Iran as well as the US and its allies?
According to NPR, CNN, MSNBC, HuffPo, et al, it's because he's black.  

If you listen to Fox or Rush it's alternately because he's incompetent, or because he wishes to destroy the parts of the country against which he is ideologically opposed.  Not sure how it is both of these.

The government does not have the capability to create real jobs, or improve conditions of the economy.  All it can and has done is abuse some of us in order to gain the temporary support of others.
Why do you feel that government doesn't have the capability to create real jobs? Isn't the federal government one of the biggest employers in the USA? Or are you refering to the capability of the government to stimate jobs in the current economy?
Such jobs have equivalent impact on quality of life as nail salon studios.  In some cases they aren't even neutral, but contribute negative GDP.  

&gt;     The story goes that Milton Friedman was once taken to see a massive government project somewhere in Asia.  
    Thousands of workers using shovels were building a canal.
    Friedman was puzzled.
    Why weren’t there any excavators or any mechanized earth-moving equipment?
    A government official explained that using shovels created more jobs.
    Friedman’s response: “Then why not use spoons instead of shovels?”
So what should the government do to stimulate the economy and job growth?

They are saying your country will need a bailout soon... and that no one is rich enough to actually go through with it and do it.  Germany certainly could not bail out France without breaking themselves.

They are saying if France goes, the Euro goes.

Something here isn't working.  Is the media broken?  Is your economy broken?  Is your currency broken?

It is popular in conservative circles to say that the French brand of socialism will never work for long.

As a student in more than $20k deep in debt, it would be nice to only owe $4,500.  As someone who owes more than $5k for a gallbladder incident (in which I did not get a surgical operation), it would be nice to have free healthcare.

From my... layman's point of view, it appears the greatest damage occurs when a nation straddles the line between capitalism and socialism.  France doesn't have the world's most expensive health care system - We do.  Yet you get treatment free over there, most of us over here do not.  In the near future, it'll become even more expensive - as American subjects are pawned off to the health care industry at prices we can't refuse.

-- rant aside, do you live with your parents?  How common is it for adults to live with their parents in France, is it by necessity, and how long do they usually stick around?  

I ask because, if half or more of my income went to taxes, I'd still be living with my mom too.
ask the people who paid all the taxes for you to go to school and get back to me when you star making money, whats your taxation percentage. i have no problem with the idea of universal healthcare just the execution
 
Haha! 

Though I think everyone will agree that the government's role is to provide a safety net for the disabled and for those that can't help them selves. Also, I think that most people will agree that the government can function in a way to retard the boom cycles and help get us out of the bust cycles. 

In the gilded age the government was mostly hands off... every decade or so there was a depression and a panic. In 1893 there was a giant 4 year depression. That was also the era of robber barons and when Pinkertons cracked skulls because workers wanted to work less than 60 hours a week. I hope the people who want a "hands off" approach to the structure of federal government realize that there is government regulation for a reason. 
Well she did pay for most of her votes and only like 80% of the people she paid actually voted for her, so yea she kind of cheated but didn't do a very good job at it, sometimes the crazy is just a bit too much for even the biggest cash whores.
The priority of the government is to defend its own citizens, not those of other countries. And perhaps, just perhaps, stopping doing one of the most antagonising things we're doing in the Middle East may temper Islamic anger towards the West.

We mustn't let special interests cloud our judgement with regards to Israel's actions. If Israel were to become more aggressive towards other Middle Eastern states, they would become a serious liability to their Western allies, especially in terms of energy security.

Like everything else, the US's alleged Zionism is going to be rooted deeply in realpolitik. No easy solutions there.
I consider myself an old school republican (meaning I hated George W). The private sector needs to be creating jobs, not the public sector. The federal government is purposely causing inflation by continuously creating money. The very people that the democrats are trying to help (the poor) they are actually hurting in the long run. These dependency programs are a disaster. Republican are not angels, I will give you. This whole raise/cut taxes on corporations is such a mess -- there are SO MANY loopholes. There are companies who are actually being PAID by the federal government rather than paying taxes. We also have to stop giving tax breaks to outsources - that is just tragic. I would love to see a tax bracket system where say, everyone starts at x% and the more people you hire (from the USA) who actually stay with the company over a year, the less percent in taxes you will pay. I don't understand how something like that is not a compromise? The companies that are actually HELPING employment in the country would benefit. That would open all kinds of doors for jobs. 


I personally believe that a welfare system is completely fine. BUT , there should be exceptions to certain things. I believe that a community should come together and help the less fortunate. When my father got bone cancer , the entire town i lived in participated in a charity drive to raise money to go towards operations to improve his health. When you have a completely government run welfare system , people leech off of it for lazy reasons. 


tl;dr Welfare systems are ok if used efficiently;Community charity helped my father when he was diagnosed with cancer.
just vote for Jon Huntsman, as an independant, I think he is the only educated, logical, reasonable choice. however, the republican party of today and the one of Eisenhower are totally different. It caters to the wack jobs and fundies like Bachman and Perry over reasonable candidates like Huntsman and Paul.
Let's look at a possible scenario.

The Republican nominee ends up being Rick Perry and Obama is the given Democratic offering. Hunstman decides to run as an independent. Can I take the chance that splitting the left/moderate vote doesn't allow Perry to win?

I am no fan of Obama but the idea of a Perry Administration is enough to convince me John Titor is real.
Because you're French.

In all honesty, I wanna be French. D:
Tiger, it looks like you're switching between arguing about high costs and arguing about unemployment. Yes, efficiency is great. I would rather have 1 person doing a job and getting a high salary than 5 people gettig low salaries, but efficiency would mean ignoring the 4 others saps who lost their jobs. Personally, I think the solution is having a lower population as technology increases, but it seems Democrats are hesitant to bring up the issue, while Republicans are outright against it.
Try as he might Mr Paul can't run away from his racist past! 
Going back to our founding, using ad valorem taxes and MAYBE... AFTER a constitutional amendment to allow it, property taxes... 
check out this site... it has the most exhaustive data resources i have ever found, and is very flexible in allowing you to make ur own charts to develop your own theory.....

Indeed, given annual compound growth in the unskilled labor pool, and the common inability of the goal-less to negotiate properly, wages have not risen much for several decades.  Consequently, inflation is ruinous to low income earners.  They benefit most when purchasing power rises.
ooh graph pron. Have an upvote! You would do away with income taxes? To clarify, I mean all money earned. I want to think a flat tax would be the most fair. I honestly dont know enough about how different earning are taxed though. Would a flat tax across all income and earning be fair? and would it make an impact? 
&gt;I ask because, if half or more of my income went to taxes, I'd still be living with my mom too.

When you consider all taxes, the average tax burden on Americans is actually around 40%.
It's because these rubes would rather hold onto the belief that they're tax burdened and that the taxes would mean they couldn't go to NASCAR races this year.

Their ignorance = their chains.

If they're monied, well, it's different, they don't like you because they see you as a parasite.
I used to work with a raging liberal who was as into politics as me.  We would get into it all the time - the arguement he used against the flat tax being fair was that it "disproportionately taxed the disposable income of poor people."  While I understood where he was coming from, I still thought it was a bullshit arguement.  However, he was the inspiration of the idea on taxes which was my original post (a flat rate on everything earned over half of the national average).  It was the first proposal to which he had no counterarguement.  I really enjoyed watching him start a few, then give up on his own.

A few quick points and questions:
1) A flat tax would make an impact... under Bush the rate would have needed to be somewhere around 15% to balance the budget, now I think it would need to be around 30% or so.  It is hard to calculate since income is not evenly distributed as a function of population. 

2) When you said you weren't familiar with how different incomes were taxed, did you mean the current system?  If so, it is with brackets - ie: each dollar of each bracket is taxed at that bracket's rate... simplified example numbers: if you earned 100k, and the brackets were 0-10=0%, 10-50=25%, 50-100=50%, then you would pay: 0+10+25= 35k taxes.

3) you said graph pron, just curious, what is pron an abbreviation for?
Perhaps we ought to consider what we [know](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9WVZddH9w) and act accordingly.
So are you making any money now? A Ph.D. is just a piece of paper unless you actually do something with it.
He's every bit electable as any one else that's running, even more so because he has stuck to his core issues and has the best track record out of all the candidates so far.
It's unbelievable that all these journalists just spout Keynsian theories without taking a stand for the free market.  They're all just reporting "what politicians say" even if it's complete nonsense.  That's not news, it's propoganda.
Average maybe, but the tax differences between the states covers such a wide margin that 'average' doesn't say much.

Here in Arkansas I keep about 92% of my income after taxes.  We also have among the nation's lowest property taxes.
The USPS receives no taxpayer funding except subsidies for overseas and disabled voters.

It almost seems like a charade. It scares me that he has any support at all. It is my hope that Palin, Bachmann, and Perry have absolutely nothing to do with the upcoming election.
Jon Huntsman or I go Democrat. I am a right leaning moderate but damnit, I am tied of the Republicans putting up crazy panderers for office. 
Sure, but maybe not as much a liability as Bachmann.  It obviously tells you the party is in trouble when the people you're trying to appeal to consider intelligence and reasonableness to be a liability.
Bachmann was dead in the water before she entered the race. I am looking more seriously at Ron Paul because I think his debates with Obama will be very interesting indeed. *I do it all for the thrill*
They're crazy alright. Crazy like a fox. They know exactly what they're doing, and they're working hand in hand with the media to do it.
Agreed.  I don't even live in the US so the more comical the better.
The media is simply reporting what sells. Idiot predisential candidates sell. Talking crap on opponents sells. Thoughtful, educated dialogue is never interesting to the media.
Where did you move to and for what reasons?
"The priority of the government is to defend its own citizens, not those of other countries." -exactly

And that is where the contention lies. We send money en masse to Israel and defend their insane behavior politically. They are a liability and give us back nothing.
If we stop taking sides in the middle east and influencing issues on the ground, they will be forced to deal with matters themselves and we will sit back and let them. The current middle east is the result of colonialism and CONSTANT intrusions by superpowers into the lives of the people of the middle east.
I am basically promoting doing now what will happen when the oil runs out anyway. That is, "What middle east? That land of sand and war?" We will soon view the middle east as we do Africa. Worthless. It is unfortunate but true. Otherwise where is our involvement in crises in Africa where there are oppressive dictatorships???
With the recent poll ratings, I'd say he's a better pick for GOP than the other candidates [reference](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/gallup-perry-leading-nationally-romney-second-paul-third-212542697.html)
I am!
I'm really interested, for those that are, in hearing why you support him?
Unless it comes out that he drinks the blood of puppies or something, he's got my vote.  I think he's the one best suited to encourage the private sector, and he's not bat-shit crazy talking about reeducation camps like Bachmann.  To me, he's a not-Mormon version of Romney (who I'd vote for over Perry if he weren't Mormon).
As a moderate Democrat, I hope to God you guys are in the Republican majority.
I'd say the people that live there have a hand in it too.  The outside world meddles, but they support all manner of sides.  Ultimately, what Iran or any other state will look like will be a consequence of what the people who live there expect it to look like.
Why does his religion matter?
&gt;A Presidential Candidate like Ron Paul seriously only runs once in a blue moon.

He ran in 2008.
Because I consider Mormons as bat-shit crazy as Scientologists.  Choosing to believe in a religion founded by a convicted fraudster says something about your judgement, in my mind.
The average interval between Full Moons is about 29.5 days, whilst the length of an average month is roughly 30.5 days. This makes it very unlikely that any given month will contain two Full Moons, though it does sometimes happen.

On average, there will be 41 months that have two Full Moons in every century, so you could say that once in a Blue Moon actually means once every two-and-a-half years.

So, by 2012, he will be at just about 2 blue moons. :P
I think you are very Prudent in your logic, i mean the republicans this year have so many great candidates, Mitt Romney seems to be leading in the polls, with Perry and Bachmane coming up at 3rd and 4th... and Herman Cain Pokemon master is in this... and yeah.. nobody else i can think of in the race... not.. at all. but i think Rick Perry has the best organization skills, looks at the good hes done in Texas, and woo dogie have we had great Texas governors for presidents 


Perry is a strong second. I am hoping Palin throws her hat in so we can get all our support behind her : )
Not me; My dad is though.
I'm voting for Obama!
They are a small first world country with a well-educated population. In the absolute worst case scenario (Jews being run out of Israel) there are *plenty* of countries that would be willing to accept such skilled immigrants.
But believing in a religion with virgin births and sky wizards is logical, right?
Not at all.  But look up Joseph Smith's history (convicted of fraud, couldn't replicate his 'divine translation', etc.) and some of the silly shit Mormonism teaches (no matter what your religion, magic underwear is silly).
What about believing in a religion because the friends and relatives of your ancestors were tortured and murdered resulting in your ancestors accepting their new faith (all brands of Christianity, even Protestants as their brand is a direct result of prior genocides, currently followed) out of fear? It isn't bat-shit-crazy to think that's the one True religion, is it?
I won't defend the practice, but at least that's logical from a self-preservation perspective.  Look at my other responses here for more detail.

The kicker for me isn't the logic of the beliefs, it's the faith in the messenger.  If Michael Vick came to me pitching a plan to invest in an animal shelter, I'd not buy what he's selling.
If Michael Vick came to you house and knocked out your loved ones with a football to the temple and let his pitt bull maul their unconscious body and told you that dog belonged in one his shelters then you would invest?
Maybe I'm too drunk, but I'm not drawing the same parallels in this analogy you are.
Winning against your peers is one thing, facing the real opponent is quite different...
As a not-Democrat, 'not Obama' is outpolling the Pres pretty consistently right now...
When you compare actual, existing people, though, the Dems - at least so far - are ahead in general, with Obama as no exception. Those in glass houses...
No it just wastes or misallocates resources. To spend money the government has to take it from the people who have actually earned it. The people know better how to spend their money than the government. If there is a lack of demand it is for a reason. That reason is previous over spending. The solution is that people need to replenish their savings by working and producing valuables. The solution is more production. Look up the term "supply side economics". Government spending does not produce real value. Read this great book Economics in one lesson: http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Hazlitt00.pdf

And as concerns the law and the role of the State read Bastiat: The Law: http://mises.org/books/thelaw.pdf

Enjoy!

Here is one reason! Tax increases are bad for the economy and a major job looser.
http://www.illinoispolicy.org/news/article.asp?ArticleSource=4362
Superpowers market a product that causes disaster. There is no warning label printed on the box of American Foreign Policy. We bribe with lies and then backstab. They never know its coming. If they are smart and refuse the "product", we deliver it anyway by throwing it at their head.
I think Ron Paul can beat Obama, but I am worried that he will not win his own party's nomination...

I think that Rick Perry will lose to Obama, but I am worried he WILL win his party's nomination...
I like Ron Paul as much as the next guy, but as much as he's changed his ideals to try to get the nomination, I don't ever see it happening. One election he's a staunch libertarian, the next he has changed to republican, he's always angry, and he seems to radical for the conservatives and democrats alike. 
Agreed..hopefully this election he has a better shot at making office. He's got my vote.
&gt; So what should the government do to stimulate the economy and job growth?

Encourage saving. Discourage spending and borrowing.

What the government **shouldn't** do is artificial market correction, which has a piss-poor track record. Bailing out companies that are going out of business is throwing money away away for the sake of short term solutions to longer term problems. Same with stimulus packages - artificial adjustments to the dollar are just that, artificial.

The cure to a recession is having a recession. It sucks, but it's reality. Only the dollar gaining strength can give the dollar its strength. And the prevention of a recession is fiscal responsibility. 
Yes, I am very aware.  Those things sound silly to you because there's no evidence to back it up and it goes against common day experiences.  That's how I feel about all religion.  
He still wasn't elected.

Lie a Minute Limbaugh proves he thinks is base is Racist, by all the little racist hints he gives in his broadcast.

But, sadly, the jokes on them.
Republicans will use that racism to destroy Social Security, Medicaid, and while they're telling their base Global Warming isn't real, Texas is in the deepest drought in 100 years.

While Right Wing Hedge funds are Buying up Land and Water Rights, preparing for Global Warming.  If the base believed in global warming, they'd REFUSE to have their water supplies Privatized, which makes water available for commercial use and Much More Expensive to Communities.

This is interesting.  Is there any reason for this correlation? The article just seems to say "taxes increased and unemployment rose" rather than "taxes increased and caused unemployment to rise because of...".  Do you know of any other articles on the subject that go further in depth?   If so I'd be interested to read them.

Thanks for your post!
Absolutely everyone who follows any brand of modern Christianity does so out of tradition and that tradition's impetus was fear. Fear of being slaughter by some maniac crusader, or Conquistador, or slave trader, etc. There is no such thing as a genuine, free-choice Christian anymore unless you can trace your ancestry back to the backwoods communes of the late Roman Empire. And nobody, I don't think, can. 

Christianity has been imposed on peoples over the last 1800 years or so through oppression and violence. It blows my mind that so many African Americans are devoutly Christian. Think about it, not 7 or 8 generations ago were their ancestors were plucked from Africa and forced to be Christian. The heavy Catholicism in Latin America equally blows my mind. And if you go back far enough you see that the big project in the Medieval world was properly Christianizing "heretics." If you didn't want to be like the guy with the big sword and the cross on his shield you got the big sword through the chest. 

tl;dr: ALL Christianity today is based on a violent act of coercive conversion. Mormonism and Scientology are bat-shit crazy, but not anymore than anything else. Its all crazy and I can't support a politician who claims to believe in any of it. I don't split hairs.    
What state are you representing?

Also, tell us more about yourself.  Who are you, what do you do for a living... are you a just seeking power or sincerely trying to change things for the better?

And lastly, if you feel as though you don't have a chance on your own merits as an independent, what makes you think you'll have a chance as a Republican?
So you're saying that people in general should just quit and never strive for success if it isn't obtained on the first try? I can think of several people, Thomas Edison for example, who would disagree with you.
If he were in the states wouldnt matter how much money he was making the majority of it would be going towards the student loan he had to get in order to obtain such a piece of paper.
America/Canada live a life of luxury ie we buy tickets to sports events, huge tvs, where as over in Europe the house are smaller they pay more taxes so they can have better lives, we focus too much on material things which is why we don't want to pay higher taxes for improvements to health care and what have you. 
Don't kid yourself, you haven't fully gotten rid of material excess.  Besides, that's not why we pay low taxes.  We tend to pay low taxes because we're individualists.  The community matters sure, but usually only locally.  A guy in Arkansas couldn't give two fucks about healthcare in New York.  He doesn't see himself as a New Yorker, but as an Arkansan.

But we often vote for higher taxes to improve conditions in our neighborhoods, cities, and states when we feel a need to.

And when a disaster happens, we still extend help to other states.  Actual help - we go to those states ourselves and lend a hand, or donate to the relief effort.  Taxes weren't raised nationwide to assist in the recovery of Joplin, New Orleans, or New York City - they didn't have to be.

As for healthcare, that's a disaster in the making.  Most of us get it through our jobs, so we don't notice.  Fewer businesses are able to afford it though (preferring instead, to pay a yearly fine), and as a result more people are going without.

I personally haven't had health insurance since I was 18 when I was covered by my mother's insurance.  My two part time jobs do not include health insurance benefits, my type of work is more of a niche here, so I don't know when I'll get a new full time job. But for now I'm young and healthy.  When I'm older I will have to figure out a way to get it.
Media bias and ignorance are partly to blame. Also, RP has charisma issues, but this doesn't make him a poor choice for President.  Does the next President have to be so handsome and charming.  I just want to see a candidate that cares about the middle class.

I am Canadian I am just speaking in general I have friends over in Norway, Denmark, etc, and they were shocked at the size of houses and what we have in them when they come over here, I apologize though for saying that every material thing is gone cause obviously that is stupid. 
I agree with you about the states thinking individualist like but, my view point is this: I would rather give a little extra for other peoples needs else where, because sooner or later I will more than likely need that help in return. 
Health care and education should be at the top of the list for basic human rights because not everyone is dealt the same hand in life some more fortunate, some less fortunate, and the less fortunate shouldn't have to fork over their entire paychecks just to stay alive. 
I will say though that Welfare checks should not be given out, because then people abuse, instead that money should go towards creating jobs for them so they can begin to support themselves. 
I like John Hunstman and Gary Johnson, but I have a feeling I'll be voting for Obama.
Listen to Dennis Prager's "8 Reasons why a Welfare State is Worse"
http://townhall.com/talkradio/dennisprager/590556

Just because you are a 'success story' doesn't mean it is good overall.
I moved to Canada, for work and I have some family ties here.
You pay 11$ for a 5$ foot long. And how much is gas?
First, the USA has medicare, medicaid, welfare personal insurance, and more charities than you can shake a stick at.  We too have 'poor' families with medical conditions (my sister in law has crones disease, and she grew up in a single parent home with her sister), yet she was able to get the care she needed through insurance.

There are two schools of thought here.  

1) The liberal/left thought, which is socialism.  Ie, tax the rich because they have too much and let the government be the all-knowing body that distributes money as it sees fit.

2) The republican/right thought, which is capitalism.  Ie, let charities help those who are sick, or give out loans to people who are sick with the expectation that they can be held personally accountable.  The idea here is, there are tons of people who abuse the governments entitlements, and personal giving puts more responsibility on those who are poor or sick to make good use of their donation.

No republican likes seeing someone go hungry or in pain.  But, at the same time, we also hate seeing the government take our money and give it out like candy to whomever asks for it.
The line between free healthcare and welfare is pretty arbitrary.  People need food and shelter more than they need healthcare.  So if you wish to provide free healthcare via tax payer funds, why shouldn't you also cover the more pressing needs?

If healthcare is free, why isn't food free?  What about the internet - shouldn't that be free too?  What about transportation?  What about clothes?

Besides, making healthcare tax-payer funded is just a band-aid to a bigger problem.  Healthcare is just too damn expensive.  If we subsidize it further the price will balloon out of control even more than it does already.  The healthcare industry will be given a direct tap into the wallets of individuals, with or without our consent.  At that point they can charge us whatever they want because they know the government will pay them.

At least with single-payer out of the way, we have a choice to pay a fixed fine.  If healthcare costs more than that fine, some of us can just go without.  The rest aren't so lucky I'll admit.  But I think the healthcare bill took us just close enough to the fire to cause the kind of problems I'm talking about.

---

edit:

I agree education should be free.  But no free-er than it is.  What's happening to college tuition is something similar to what I described in the first part of the post.  Colleges see financial aid grants as free money.  They can charge us whatever they want because they know the government will cover it.  Thus you have the ballooning tuition costs.
nah dude fuck that, we need another Teddy Roosevelt!

Bully!
And just because they are a socialist doesn't mean they don't have valid points of view.
apparently Perry is G.W.B on steroids :D
&gt;To spend money the government has to take it from the people who have actually earned it. The people know better how to spend their money than the government.

My only issue is the gaping chasm of income inequality that Reagean-esque policies have increased and enforced.

Low taxation when income is distributed fairly enough to support a strong middle class is a fantastic recipe for success.

Low taxation when income has been sequestered to the top does nothing but keep more of the money at the top.

Taxation is a poor way to influence the Capitalist class to end their unfair wage systems that enrich only their own class. But until someone comes up with a way revitalize the middle class and reverse the tide of destructive income inequality, it's the best tactic we have.

(When I say income inequality, I don't mean socialism, everyone has the same, I mean, there is an expected amount of inequality in a capitalist system, and then there is what we have, an egregious amount). 

EDIT: Remember, after WWII our debt/GDP ratio was 120% (20% higher than today) and taxes on the richest were between 90%-94% for almost two entire decades. Anyone who claims that high taxes on the rich is antithesis to job creation and economic growth has a painfully short memory, as taxes on the rich were their highest during our most productive period ever. 
...but that's not true.  Even just looking at the Department of Defense and nuclear weapons- that's $768 billion in 2011 (if you count Veteran spending, it's up to $910 billion).  Social Security's budget was $748 billion, Medicare was $494 billion, and Medicaid was $276 billion. ([Source](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals))
I'll take the non-partisan [CBO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png) over WH spin any day.  
That uses the limited definition of "discretionary Department of Defense spending".  It excludes *mandatory* defense spending, nuclear weapons, and veteran costs, which add up to $170 billion in 2011.  And for the definition of Medicare costs, it excludes Medicare premiums, which reduces the tax burden of Medicare by $70 billion.

It isn't a matter of spin or accuracy, it's just a matter of deciding what you want to look at.  It seems silly to me to not include nuclear weapons and veteran costs in a comprehensive measure of "defense spending".

Finally, what about nom-nom-nom's response?  Why should SS or Medicare/caid costs be blamed on Obama?  If anything, he's taken steps to *decrease* their impact on our budget deficit (though Medicaid does increase in size under the Affordable Care Act).
A welfare system isn't bad depending on how it is implemented.    Some Americans just tend to believe that welfare should not be the responsibility of the government.  As others have hinted, Americans are very big on personal freedoms and individualism.  A welfare system managed by the state, requires that the earnings of one hard working individual are taken and given to another (usually in the American view) considered to be a lazy individual (not necessarily true).  If you fail to turn your earnings over to another in need of welfare then you risk being jailed or having your property (fruits of your hard work) taken from you with force.  Americans tend to generally be more than willing to help those in need, but believe that doing so should be an individual choice.  I choose to give a portion of my earning to help those who are less fortunate or fallen on bad times, but I should not be coerced with the threat of violence against me or my family by my government if my choice of what or how much to contribute is in disagreement with government or society as a whole.  I have my beliefs just as you have yours and I am sure we differ on any number of issues.  Americans want the choice to live a life representative of their individual beliefs, not necessarily the beliefs of the society.  As a result, they prefer to retain the choice of how their money is spent with regard to which cause or issue.  Forcing them to pay taxes that go to support a social, military, economic, etc… causes that they don’t support is very unappealing.  I don’t touch on many of the issues that surround/support this mindset, but I think you get the point.
&gt;also I generally read that people oppose freedom and welfare,

You're right; we Republicans do hate freedom: the freedom to live healthy, productive lives.

It'd be nice if GhostWithToast started wielding his banhammer, but that doesn't seem like it's gonna happen.
Why would we ban people here? The ONLY posts are from libtards. Nothing would be posted if we banned people.
and?
Its simple: employ people for the benefits instead of just giving them to them. There's a huge array of public services poor people could be filling for wages of the same amount they'd be receiving on welfare. Fixing infrastructure, working as farm hands, janitors, and work to support a public healthcare infrastructure. The kind of jobs "Americans don't want."
When someone is in need of food aid they *will* get food aid and when they *need* shelter they *will* get sheltered, and when they *need* healthcare they *should* get healthcare.
Also, end the war on drugs. Introduce a new legitimate, billion-dollar, tax-paying industry overnight.

WWII ended the Great Depression because the government increased military spending, buying things from American manufacturers. The government could be spending the same magnitude of money on contractors to repair our infrastructure, build new hospitals and schools, etc. If only we had the funds (which could be found in taxes on current narcotics, closing corporate tax loopholes and ending the Bush tax cuts, as well as our foreign occupations of pretty much the whole damn world). 

The government could even start their own companies to employ people and, when they become viable businesses, sell them off to the employees of the company. This would shake up the economy, as well.

He ran once 20 years ago and then again in the last election. Do you think Romney looks silly for running twice in a row?
You should check out the book "Washington Rules" by Andrew Bacevich, who's a professor of International Relations at Boston University, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and a former career officer in the US Army. He puts forth a pretty convincing case that our foreign policy over the past sixty years is fundamentally flawed, and has actually made us less safe.
Romney looks silly for that, and being a mormon
It's so easy to make fun of the liberal glue sniffers, they're like retarded toddlers. It gets to be a problem however, when their noise (through sheer numbers) drowns out actual intellectual conversation.

Didn't you hear the president say that Shovel Ready Jobs were a joke?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVonk_OqEUU

You do remember the shovel ready job promise, don't you? NPR did like 100 articles on how the stimulus was going to save the economy.

http://www.wbur.org/npr/101547870/what-shovel-ready-projects-mean-for-the-economy

http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100295436

http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104597473

http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98068832



Guess how many articles NPR ran when the president said "Uh... the shovel ready jobs were not ... uh ... as shovel ready as we thought".

But Jobs and the economy are the least of my problems with Obama. His failure to create jobs is obvious.

How do you feel about the "Non-war" in Libya? Do you think that as long as the president does not order any ground troops into a country, he can order bombs to be dropped on that country without any need to get congressional permission?

If George W Bush tried to run with some "Non-War" bullshit every liberal/progressive/democrat in the country would explode with disbelief simultaneously. But when Barry H. Obama explains to the anti-war left that it doesn't count as a war *because there are no boots on the ground*, When president Obama (former constitutional professor) patiently explains that he does not need congressional permission... the anti-war left suddenly nods in agreement and patiently explain how awesome this new Obama Doctrine is to everyone they know. How is that possible, gnome sane?

How, as a democrat, do you feel about the "Non-war" or "The overseas contingency operation" against "Man-made-disaster-makers"?

EDIT: great idea coming to the R/republican tab for some debate.
I think that in the President's defense, he really wanted to have more direct spending in the stimulus package and less tax cuts, but he had to compromise some to get the bill passed. 

In the last couple weeks, I think I've come to realize that it is diffuclt for the government to "Create Jobs," However I am convinced that tax cuts are not the way to go about it. Perhaps the water-downed stimulus package didn't do all that it had set out to do, but I don't think that "cut, cap balance" would do anything other than sink our economy ( in the Republicans defense, I know that this was an ideological pandering of the base, that no sane person actually supported it) 

I think that the "war-powers act" is a flawed piece of legislation. I do however feel that the nature of the world has changed from 1787 when the Constitution was drafted. I think the president needs to have some authority to  commit military force quickly (more quickly than a congressional action would take.) 

I think that Libya is an interesting situation where we weren't the ones really leading the effort. We were supporting our NATO allies in the conflict. I think there is a distinction in supporting an alliance that we are fully committed to and taking military action on our own. 

Personally, my biggest with the Iraq and Afgan wars is that we never really had any idea what we were doing there. Before we entered the First World War, Woodrow Wilson laid out his "Fourteen Points" that spelled out the casus belli for war and what the aftermath will look like. Bush only said "Freedom" I do no think the Bush administration took a sober look at the actual costs of occupying and rebuilding. One would think that if more sober heads were in the Bush administration, they would have looked to the USA's pacification and occupation of the Phillipines. A totally costly and expensive war in both dollars and human life. 

Obama did some silly political and legal wrangling to accomplish what he wanted. The end of the Quaddafi regime. If this is good or bad foreign policy, I don't know. However, he accomplished his well laid out goals with minimal human losses (if any) and with minimal cost. 

To summarize. I think that the president should have the authority to commit military might quickly and with out congresses approval. But with ultimly some legislative oversight. Of course the power of the purse comes from congress, so if they don't fund such a massive military (A military that has the capibilitly to make strikes like Libya with out extra funding) these extra-curricular excursions wouldn't happen. 
Though I dislike her with immense dislike, I don't feel that that disliking justifies an accusation about her sexual morals. However, if you can provide proof that she is a whore, send it up.

I asked you how you felt about the non-war doctrine.

&gt;I think that Libya is an interesting situation where we weren't the ones really leading the effort. We were supporting our NATO allies in the conflict. I think there is a distinction in supporting an alliance that we are fully committed to and taking military action on our own.

You have already re-written history. The United states led the effort at the outset. As well, we were not supporting any NATO allies. No NATO allies were attacked by any country. The NATO charter specifically states that it's members are only bound to action in the defense of a fellow NATO ally.

&gt;Bush only said "Freedom" I do no think the Bush administration took a sober look at the actual costs of occupying and rebuilding. 

You never listened to a single speech he gave then.

&gt;Obama did some silly political and legal wrangling to accomplish what he wanted. The end of the Quaddafi regime. If this is good or bad foreign policy, I don't know. However, he accomplished his well laid out goals with minimal human losses (if any) and with minimal cost.

So you are just going to ignore the fact that he went to war without congressional authorization. And you will also ignore the fact that he refuses to call his involvement war. And you justify it all with a "Ends justify the means" speech. Good luck with that, gnome sane?


(How do you do the fancy formatting???)

I think it was some interesting legal wrangling that Obama did. But (correct me if I am wrong) Congress has given the president the authority to commit troops and the military for 60 days without congressional approval. So the initial commitment of troops was legal. 

On the doctrine of Non-War: I think that there are many situations that will be made better for USA interests that will involve the projection of USA military might. I am personally opposed to war and death and destruction, however... I realize that lobbing a couple of bombs somewhere will help USA interests. And I also realize that sometimes Congress is slow to act and that the President might need a free hand. 

Maybe I am confused with the Libyan situation... I thought that the bombing campaign was an effort of NATO allies under the structure of NATO command. 

Lol, I exaggerated about the Bush speech. But can you please point out the speech where President Bush laid out his long term plan for the occupation and long term rebuilding of Iraq and Afganistan before we entered into those conflicts? I cited President Wilson's famous "Fourteen Points" speech before we entered into the Great War as a good example of long term planning. 

I am going to ignore the fact that Obama went into war without congressional authorization. What does it matter? The president already has authority to go to war for 60 days with out congressional approval. Previous Presidents have set precedent that they can commit troops and military might. 

How is our conflict in Libya a war exactly? What sacrifices did Obama ask the USA people to make? I think that it is silly that we throw the word "war" around willy-nilly. We've been fighting a "War on Poverty" for the last 50 years!

Tell me, gnome sane, how you would like to define war?

Yes, the ends do justify the means. Jefferson acted outside his constitutional role when he made the Louisiana Purchase. The ends justified the means there. Jackson violated an order from the US Supreme court when he removed the Indians. I am not saying that the president shouldn't be bound by law, but if congress is really unhappy with Obama's use of Presidential authority, then impeach him!

What it boils down to is this: Congress has the power of the purse. If they don't want the Executive using the military like Obama has, they should NOT fund the military where it can be used in this way. That is the Legislative check on the Executive power. Congress should only fund the military in the way that they feel is proper for the projection of USA influence around the world. 
(How do you do the fancy formatting???)

Heh... there is a formatting help blue text link in the bottom right of the box you type responses in.

&gt;I think it was some interesting legal wrangling that Obama did. But (correct me if I am wrong) Congress has given the president the authority to commit troops and the military for 60 days without congressional approval. So the initial commitment of troops was legal.

Yes. The illigal part was when he came back to congress and said "I don't need your permission, *this isn't really a war*". And for some reason his jedi mind trick worked on the weak willed populace.

&gt;I am personally opposed to war and death and destruction, however... I realize that lobbing a couple of bombs somewhere will help USA interests. And I also realize that sometimes Congress is slow to act and that the President might need a free hand.

WOW. So you were anti-war until Obama did it, and now you don't mind dropping some bombs... Were you aware that the rebels in Libya and the red cross and red crescent estimate death toll in the last 6 months to be around 50,000?

&gt;Maybe I am confused with the Libyan situation... I thought that the bombing campaign was an effort of NATO allies under the structure of NATO command.

You are repeating Obama's excuse perfectly.

&gt;But can you please point out the speech where President Bush laid out his long term plan for the occupation and long term rebuilding of Iraq and Afganistan before we entered into those conflicts?

You can't find a speech where he doesn't. His infamous "Mission Accomplished" speech? Did you ever hear it or read it? He starts by saying the mission (to remove Saddam from power) was accomplished, but the long road ahead in reconstruction will be difficult. Did you know that? Bush frequently made statements, but the basic summary was always "We will stand down when the Iraqis can stand up for themselves".

Now flip your question. What did Obama say about Libya? He repeatedly said it is only a humanitarian mission. (Because dropping bombs and handing out weapons like candy to untrained civilians is "humanitarian"). He specifically said he thought Gadaffi should go, but that it was not his mission (Another boldfaced lie in a long string).

But most importantly; what is Obama's plan for Libya? Bush may not have had enough boots on the ground to control the looting in Iraq... what boots does Obama have stopping the same problem in Libya? Who is stopping the rebels from killing every black man they see? (In Libya, the blacks are being slaughtered because some black mercinaries worked for Gadaffi. About 3 million black immigrants working in Libya.... and probably only thousands as military.)

&gt;How is our conflict in Libya a war exactly?

You now prove my point. As a person who claims to be anti-war, you don't know that bombing tripoli for 6 months is a war-like action. Because you so desprately want Obama to do no wrong, you actually ask me "How is our conflict in Libya a war exactly?"...

Good luck with that, gnome sane?

&gt;Tell me, gnome sane, how you would like to define war?

This is how Obama describes it as a non-war:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/15/white-house-libya-war-powers-act-congress_n_877749.html

"U.S. operations do not involve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces, nor do they involve the presence of U.S. ground troops, U.S. casualties or a serious threat thereof, or any significant chance of escalation into a conflict characterized by those factors," 

So because we can bomb the shit out of Libya from the air and launch hundreds of missiles from sea... it isn't a war. Because there are no boots on the ground and 6 months isn't "sustained fighting"... And everyone who loves Obama, even if they protested any and all wars from 2003-2008, will agree.

What it boils down to is; you are an exact example of the person I am talking about.

Good luck with that too, gnome sane?

How about Jon Huntsman?  I don't think he has a chance, but he doesn't seem off the deep end like most of the other GOP hopefuls.

[Socially](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Mike_Huckabee#LGBT_issues) he seems to be very in line with Bachmann (abortion, intelligent design, against stem cell research, thinks gays are an abomination, thinks gitmo is fine, supports the wars, etc).  No, these are not the only issues I'm looking at, but they are the ones that make me question what you like in him as a candidate that you oppose in the other GOP hopefuls.

I am sorry but after reading the comments here I can see that it is no better on this side of the fence either. I guess I will just have to continue to consider myself unassigned to a party and continue voting by looking objectively at each issue.

On a more serious note.  Let's discuss some actual issues/policies you have an issue with.
DAE fell like the whole Left/Right argument is really a false dichotomy?  There are more than 2 solutions to every problem, so that should necessitate more than two political parties.  Of course in the states we run into the problem of the press completely retarding actual discussion of problems and instead focus on shallow superficial issues.

The more I see Obama, I actually like the guy on a personal level.  He is our President, and as a person we could do much much worse.

I just know our country is at a turning point right now, and needs laser focused leadership to help our long term economic and debt picture.  And the Obama administration's policies are causing more harm than helping.

I'm not completely against manufacturing, but I'm sure there's a way to please the greenies as well as start jobs again.  For example, many of our jobs have gone overseas.  Up north, many manufacturing jobs here are gone because of globalization.  A way to bring jobs back is to give them back, right where they started.  Though, there is the issue of higher wages increasing the price of a product.  Help, anyone?

Put a solid cap on malpractice law suits, punish those who file founded frivolous law suits, much more heavily regulate the pharmaceutical industry to stop price gouging.  Change the copyright laws, not the right term I think, which allows companies to keep re-introducing the same med with minor cosmetic changes, which leads to higher prices.  If you want to mandate health insurance, mandate that employeers who employ over a certain amount of people must offer a health insurance plan.  If more people have a viable option of insurance, prices will go down.  The more viable choices people have the lower the insurance cost.  The law suit change(s) alone will lower costs dramatically.   
How is that different from other generations? My father in the 70's smoked weed every day and never volunteered for anything.

I am a pansy douche liberal and I would love Bachmann or Parry or Palin to sweep the Republican nomination.

Take that as you will.
I had not considered a Ron Paul nomination that way, especially as it would affect Obama.  Very insightful.
I suppose Democrats would love to have Parry or Bachmann to win the election; All the Dem votes would be for Obama, most of the independent votes would as well, and a significant portion of Republicans would probably vote to re-elect him as well.
Perry has too many iffy campaign donations, and he falls flat on the immigration issue. Mitt Romney has a serious chance at contention with Obama since he has private sector experience, and seems more lenient to work with Democrats to get things done. 

On another note, I loved Newt tonight. If he doesn't get the nomination, I could see him being an amazing VP.
But Alaska is also one of top 5 states thar suck on the federal governments tit. As a matter of fact the top 10 states sucking on the government tit are conservative states. They love not paying taxes but love getting the money from taxes. This is based on the amount of federal dollars states receive compared to the amount of taxes paid.

So... you're sarcastic douchey comment is basically arguing that an anti-corporate Republican is a contradiction in terms, right? Then how can anyone be a Republican? Don't you see? 
Actually I was implying that just because that may be one stereotypical quality, doesn't mean we are all far right repubs. 

But to answer your question, I think in most cases I agree with some anti-corporation policies.

Paul in 2012. He may be radical but if you think of the compromise he will have to make to get something passed, it'll create the perfect amount of correction and redirection America needs. 

And everyone knows its going to have to be Paul, Perry, or Romney and of the 3 it better be Paul.

1. In my opinion, what has Obama done wrong.


-Stimulus package. Why: This answer is complicated. When the government spends money, any money, be it stimulus or otherwise, that money has to come from somewhere. Government revenues come from taxes or borrowing, which both require the removal of capital from the private sector. That money is then allocated to however the government believes is best to generate more economic activity. Keynesians will tell you that this money spent will generate trickle down effects like the spending multiplier. The fallacy here is that the money that would have been spent in the private sector has the exact same effect where it already was. The best outcome of stimulus policy is merely to redistribute money in a zero sum game of sorts. The worst outcome is that chunks of the money are wasted, as has happened with the ARRA. Example: "investments" in union pensions, which fed into the stock market, stimulating nothing but mutual and hedge fund managers pocketbooks. In our case, the stimulus didn't stimulate; rather it acting as a sedative through the removal of capital from the private sector and then its destruction through waste.

-PPACA. Why: Has provisions for spending money for stimulus. Places large costs on business and private individuals. Provides few market based mechanisms for reduction of costs and instead focuses on increasing insurance enrollment. Note: I have read the bill.

2. In my opinion, how could things be done better?

-What is the best way to stimulate the economy? Keynesians will argue that spending is the best way because it boosts demand and thus leads to full employment. I argue that Keynesian policies actually do the reverse of their intended effects (see above).

I would propose to change the tax system in a drastic and way that many will no doubt see as radical.
At the moment, the lowest 50% of earners in the US pay 2.9% of income taxes collected by the federal government. The wealthiest 10% pay 71.2%. I would change this so that more Americans have a financial stake in how their government behaves. I would eliminate all of our current tax regulations and put in place a 10% income tax on everyone. People earning less than the average GDP per capita would receive 1/3 of the difference between their wages and the average GDP per capita in payment from the government.

I would eliminate corporate taxes, specifically double taxation. If you own a business or corporate stock, you pay zero taxes on income from those economic activities.

Tax revenues would decrease to a fraction of what they are now, but in my economy I would reduce government spending to one tenth of what it is today. All I can think about is how all that money would be so much better used by you and me.

However, who would buy all these goods? This policy is not good because you are allocating capital to projects which will never produce a return of any kind. No one today will buy 1,000,000 bulldozers, and that is why you will not see any return.

Now, you might say instead have the government spend a little on a variety of projects and increase output that way. However, this whole approach is fallacious because it ignores information. Economic information is diffuse, and widely spread amongst all 300+ million people who partake in economic activity every day. Having a single person, namely you, allocate the resources in an economy is inefficient because you cannot know everything, all of the consumer preferences and buying behaviors and investment decisions that go in the economy. Even a government bureau with 300 million people in it could not and would not be capable of aggregating enough economic information for command style keynesian stimulus to work.

Example- the soviet union's bureau of prices. they had to manage 16.5 million prices for every single good produced and sold in the USSR. they didn't manage prices very well. one old soviet joke used to be that you would call in and update your price information and they would say great, let us put you on hold, you are caller number 16 million.
You think so?  This current generation has been considered the laziest of all of them.
What do you mean by "cap"?

Sounds like a good idea.  But if they hike up the tariffs, won't they have less trade?
Suppose that'd drive domestic production then.  
I mean a solid cap on the amount of punitive damages that can be awarded.  Ask a surgeon how much their mal practice insurance costs.  We force feed people into hospitals, mistakes are bound to happen.  The docs should be held accountable for them, but if holding them accountable to the point of awarding millions of dollars is driving up costs, then something needs to happen.
Do you believe the purpose of education is to generate income?
I personally believe the purpose of paying for education is to prepare you for what you want it to do. If you go to school for mechanical engineering, or to become a doctor, then it should prepare you for that line of work.

I think the purpose of education (either at an academic institution or on your own, acquiring self-knowledge) is several-fold: prepare you for productive work, make you a more educated person on life and interactions with people, how to do things on your own, how to not get suckered into doing stupid things (making bad investments, believing the government will take care of you, not hanging out with crazy people, etc.), and allowing you to have a better life through the better actions you can take after you become more educated. Education is absolutely about being able to provide for yourself, whether that means generating income through a job, good investments, or being able to live within your means.

TL;DR: Yes!
But surely one can be immensely satisfied by pursuing academic studies without it improving earning potential in the slightest. As you say, there is much to be gained from the process of further study that is unrelated to being an economically productive person. Furthermore, in this case, a PhD most likely generated new and original research, and who knows what applications that could be put to by those that consult it, and the further value that it can have for students to come? In any case, I believe having a PhD from a respected academic institution is an achievement to be proud of, regardless of whether it improves your career prospects or not.

TL;DR I think we agree, but somehow it's not coming out right!
OK, this is how I'm reading your post:

*Some level of debt is necessary for a growing economy, so therefore ANY attempt to reduce our current debt is based on ignorance.*

Is this what you were trying to convey?
Let me back up and explain my original comment: 

In Europe, most people can get a Ph.D. as long as they want to stay in school. This has led to a lot of people with 'Ph.D.s' that can only get a job at McDonalds, if they're lucky. Whether or not this kind of waste, in the form of unproductive years spent acquiring a Ph.D., and the tax-payer money wasted on providing so much extra education, is another issue unto itself, and a model that I disagree with. That's why I asked the OP if he had a job (and my snide remark about a Ph.D. not being worth much, due to so many of them in the EU), but he hasn't responded yet, so idk.

As for an individual person (in the US), I think you have to do your due diligence when selecting a college education, the same way you'd do it for investing or buying some other type of investment.  Spending $120,000 on a degree, and then defaulting on your loan because you picked a bad major (like Cartography), is not really good for you or society. On the other hand, many people pick a Ph.D. because they want to do research, and if that's what they want to do, I think it's their personal choice to do so. I guess having a Ph.D. could be a bragging right, but I look at some Ph.D.'s the way I'd look at Jill Biden if she asked that I call her [Dr. Biden](http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/02/nation/na-dr-jill-biden2) instead. A better bragging right is someone like Steve Jobbs, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, or [Ray Bradbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_bradbury) who all made an impact on the world without having any letters at all after their names.
to a point i agree with this but i wish it wasnt this way. what i was trying to say is that a monetary system where you create money then expect interest on that money you created is inherently flawed since the debt can NEVER be payed off, EVER. What the american government needs is to create its own money and not charge interest on a form of exchange. Then and only then will we be able to get out of this 14 trillion dollar hole.
Nobody is saying pay it all off. We've hit the ceiling, it is no longer beneficial. Begin to pay it off.
I don't even think that anyone is even proposing to start paying it off. Right now they're just trying to slightly slow down its rate of growth.
okay for the sake of argument lets say we begin to pay it off tomorrow. the money we use to pay it off still has interest on it. How do you go about paying off the interest on money you say? Well the only way besides counterfeiting is to create more money. Oh wait there's interest on that money being created to pay off interest well how are we going to pay off that debt. oh yeah lets create more money. Even if the gov took every single dollar ever created and gave it back to fed we would still be in the hole. Do you see where the problem is?
For a little bit I thought that I had a grasp on what you were trying to say, but now I really don't understand it at all. Could you start from the beginning and explain it a little simpler?

When you say "create money" and "how our money is made" are you talking about the actual printing of money? And why can the debt never be paid off? 

Also, when you say "the american government needs is to create its own money" are you talking about the government kind of going into business and earning money? And also "they charge interest"... who is "they"?

I'm just totally confused.
well the oly way to create money atm is to take out loans. this goes for the people as well as the gov. when the gov creates money they give bonds to the federal reserve saying that not only will they pay the money back to the fed but they will also pay the fed interest on it. Because of this system the value of the dollar is inflated and is forced to be inflated to pay the interest witch in turn just creates an infinite amount of debt as long as this system is in place. Money is a means of exchange, unfortunately the fed has turned every dollar into debt. 
hope this helps

I'm not familiar with the economics of a degree in an American context (which sounds astronomically and unjustly expensive to me), but I don't agree with the model that you advocate. As an analogy, it sounds like treating a child like an incomplete adult. It's not, it's a complete child. In the same way, I don't regard students as incomplete citizens, that somehow are only part-way towards becoming economically productive members of society, they're students, 100% pure and simple. Not 'workers in training', those are people in training schemes/apprenticeships etc. Being in full-time education can be a fine way to spend your years, at any age, and can be the most meaningful and enjoyable time of your life (every bit as much as doing something completely different with your life, such as Messrs. Jobs, Gates &amp; Bradbury).

Sure, I don't think it's fair to expect others to ultimately foot the bill for the cost of your education, but this it true in many contexts where people take bad loans. And I agree that there are too many subjects that are offered that are of little value other than the sake of getting a qualification in them (I can't see the need to pursue a PhD in media studies, for example). And ultimately, I think that graduates do have a duty to at least pay back the money that they were granted to study, though I don't agree that the yardstick for justifying your choice of study is how much more income you can pull down compared to entrepreneurial non-graduates. Let's face it, no-one pursues cartography to get rich, they do it because they want to learn about cartography. And surely genuine satisfaction from academic achievement would not engender a desire to brag about it, it would be satisfying just to know what you've accomplished. I just think it's a flawed starting-point to view further education as a transaction that needs to have a profit margin, rather than an investment that can lead to a better life in all sorts of different ways. It's not for everyone, but I don't think it's fair to deny those who want to pursue it because they don't have the bank balance for it. It's why its so troubling here in the UK where fees have been tripled, effectively pricing poorer students out of getting a university education. Something just doesn't seem right about fencing off certain studies as the domain of only those that are wealthy enough to indulge it an an eccentricity, while the rest of us have to get on and do something that has utilitarian wage potential, regardless of whether it's what we want to do in life.
I agree with a lot of your points, thanks for the insight. I'd also like to add that the individual consumer of knowledge can and should study on their own, as they may be able to adapt to the changing world faster than the bureuecracy of most educational institutions. As an example, I studied a lot of diverse subjects while I was in school, and these helped me to pursue a job that is really unique and interesting, while most of my former classmates all got stuck doing the same thing.
as much as i agree with him in principle, i believe the word is insane that you are looking for
I have also moved to Canada (for school and now just living here because it is nice) and I really feel a growing distance from the politics, such that now when bad stuff happens to america i tend to care less and less every day
players of dominion? i love dominion. will vote for a dominion player
Perhaps.  However, I do believe mal practice costs should still be a substantial amount.  One, for paying back for the mistake.  Two, for taking care of funeral/future medical costs.  And three, for the families affected by the mal practice.  I worked with a woman whose mother died from mal-practice.  She was only 13.  She ended up having to take care of her family because her legal guardian couldn't do much (old age).  She had a rough life because of this "mistake".  But she received about 30k from her lawsuit.  Now she can restart her life and actually have a future.
How?
Take almost anything, lets go with toasters.  Toasters are currently made in china.  We might have a few made in America.  Raise tariffs on toasters, less toasters come into America.  Demand for toasters still exists, would be a larger incentive for someone to make toasters domestically.   
Soon... 
30K is fine.  When people get millions it, as bad as this sounds, is more compensation than is appropriate.  Let's face it, no money is going to bring someone back from the dead.
Did anyone else see Boehner walking the streets of D.C. wearing a pink dress and a blonde wig with high heels? 
Perfect.  Substitute the word "rich" in there with "me and my generous donors" and we might start getting to the real root of the problem.  Boehner expects everyone to "sacrifice" (the poor through reductions in 'entitlement' programs and the middle class through higher taxes) except for him and his wealthy cohorts.

I would fully support any tax increase as long as the rich have an equal percentage tax increase.  And that's only fair - why should those who can most afford to pay higher taxes get a total pass?  Because they're the ones who "create jobs"?  Like if they get a pass, they'll wax all philanthropic and put all that money saved into a new business that pays everyone (even production workers) a fair living wage?  Or buy so much more stuff that it turns the economy around magically in the next year?  Hardly.  
I must say, this is a terrible economic policy. Not only is it just a political ploy, it has been shown time and time again to reduce gov revenue. A bad plan all around.
Funny for Boehner to say that after the debt ceiling circus
Funny you mention NASCAR.  I forgot that every Republican in this country was a NASCAR fan.  Oh wait a tick!  You are trying to correlate the diction of NASCAR to every Republican in this country.  I forgot for a second that we were all southern, red neck bros who enjoy getting shitfaced in public.

Jackass.
Who does this? What are the statistics? Or is this one of those things you just *feel* is true 
Where's the money being invested into infrastructure? Also, diesn't that sound a lot like FDR's New Deal? Are you down with FDR? 

Where's the farms near the inner-city? How many places need / can afford a janitor? 
Money would need to be invested in materials as well, and then people paid to rebuild the infrastructure. Even money going to pay for materials would be an economic stimulation. And there's poor people out in the country too. If the place can't afford a janitor, that doesn't matter, because the government pays (at least part of) their salary, which would be below minimum wage so they'd still have an incentive to get a job in the private sector, which would hopefully be recovering from the spending on infrastructure materials and money the new governmentally employed consumers are spending. Imagine if half the money that went into the Iraq War went into a program like this.

And yes, I'm down with FDR.
ok
Ill be winning the presidential fund raiser too if I had special interest groups funding my election. oooooh wait the President doesn't get funding from special interest groups... Well this is gonna get very awkward for him.
This is patently false. I mean seriously, where do you get your information? France is the world's 5th largest economy, and comparable to Florida on a GDP/capita basis.

DAE feel like the Conservative/Republican/Right viewpoints get delegitimized by people who make liberal use of words like "libtard"?
So you'd vote for Obama if it were him vs her?  Or is that worse than 1000 burning suns?
The republican party of Dwight D. Eisenhower and those who came before him could not be more different from what we have now.  The current democratic party is closer to the pre 1960 GOP, in almost every way.  The modern Republican party is much closer in views and demographics to the old southern dixiecrats.  
Agreed and we are all poorer because of this change.
I think its silly to reference what percentage of the tax burden falls on various socioeconomic groups wihout also mentioning what percentage of the capitol those people actually represent.  50% of the population paying 2.9% of the income taxes sounds pretty absurd. Until you realize that the bottom 50% of the country controls about half as much wealth as the top 1%.  In fact, the top 1% controls almost half of the wealth in the country.  When you put it in that perspecive (that is, the perspective of full disclosure), the tax burden of the wealthy seems criminally low.    


Because republican lawmakers are always clamboring to admit it when they make a mistake, or tell a blatant lie.  
Remember.  You're in r/republicans.  Here "socialism" does not correspond to the actual definition of socialism.  Instead it is equivilant to stalinism, nazi-ism, facism, and every other totalitarian ism.  The use of "socialism" to referr to free, advanced, developed and sucessful modern societies like those in western europe is a moot point here.  
I believe it to be opposite. I think Obama tells blatant lies. But i respect your opinion.
I should have clarified.  I was being incredibly sarcastic.  Sorry.  

As far as I can tell, never ever ever admiting or correcting a misrepresentation of fact, a lie, or a mistake of any kind has become part of the GOP party platform.  
All politicians pull that crap. Just gotta hopefully vote for the person who doesn't lie out the ass.
Obama seems to have his head on straight, I find him to be a very composed man. maybe he isn't perfect and he hasn't lived up to all his promises, but thats the same story with many polititians. Obama is one of the more decent polititians out there, but Michele doesn't even seem to understand simple concepts like the minimum wage or how taxing the rich is needed right now. Here are my preferences in order from best to worse:

1. Obama

2. 1000 burning suns

3. everything else

4. Delete the Universe

5. Michele Bachmann
Hope in humanity: restored.
*Republican chuckles awkwardly, and stares at feet* "Yeah......."
In a country with free speech, people should learn how to defend/articulate their views; and learn how to live around others who express opposing views (Even if it's overwhelming). Then again, I'll let you know when I know how to do this, too.
Good Luck. ;)
Good to know.
No, if we just stop, the suckiness will just continue. Things will never get better on this side.
Yet despite being "49th poorest" (I think what you mean is second poorest?) it would still have better education, health care, capital investment, infrastructure, and economic output while suffering from less poverty, environmental distress, and infant mortality than most American states. Ain't that a bitch?

GDP per capita doesn't mean anything when your quality of life is substantially better. 
because obama has the gov't interfering with too much of buisnesses and too many taxes  and hurting the economy i do believe we need tax cuts to the less fourtunate but much smaller ones
you do realize that we have the lowest taxes in like the last 40 years... if taxes are too high now... why was the economy booming in the 90's? In the 1950's the highest tax rate was 90%, yet the 1950's had one of the largest growth ever seen in the history of the world.. 

In your opinion, How much in taxes should we pay?
we should have the upper class pay the highest amount about 5-10% middle class 3-5% and the lower class 1-3%
did you just call OSU a small college, cause I'm pretty sure its the largest in the country? but anyway addressing your main point, these things already exist ie Peace corps, however you are saying the government should force people to participate...sounds like totalitarianism to me
True
Why don't we do this?  o.o
You're absolutely right. Ron Paul isn't like most candidates. He comes off as genuine occasionally - something most politicians are rarely capable of. But that doesn't mean I would ever support him. He wants to shut down the Federal Reserve. Great! That is a fucked up institution. But it won't happen even if he were to become president. He wants to bring home all our troops. Terrific! But that's something that needs to be done responsibly. You can't just say "ok, war's over!" These are great things to say, but they can't be done by an administration alone. 

Furthermore, at a closer look, he's not that genuine. Some politicians say they believe in God or something to that effect because it's what people want to hear. He just speaking to a different demographic. 

What worries me, on the other hand, is what he can accomplish. He likes to say govn't agencies and policies like the EPA, Dept of Education, Labor unions, and the minimum wage(!?) should be shut down or abolished because they take away *individual freedoms*. Well what about my individual freedom to cooperate with my compatriots for a cause greater than the individual? There's no such thing as pure liberty. Where some have liberty, others have oppression, and Paul is unwilling to be genuine about that. We're a technologically advanced society, not Jefferson's agrarian egalitarian farmer paradise and we can never be that again. We have to accept who were are and the historical moment in which we reside. It demands communication and cooperation, and working together to build a better society. 

Too much work has been done over the 120 years building a better world/country suitable to our social reality, and I won't let that fall apart because of a couple misguided political parties and some codger who seems cool because he says some neat stuff, but ultimately wants to set fire to all the progress the heroes of American politics have worked to achieve. 
Haha, I called OSU a small school because I know it's the biggest! It's like calling a big guy, tiny. 

I don't know... Swisterland has a mandatory draft... They are one of the most free countries in the world. I think that forcing people to participate forces people out of their bubble and cause them to forge connections that they don't normally have. 
To me that seems really low... But maybe you think the scope of government should be less... What services do you think the government should provide? 
Ask yourself what's standing in your way to build a toaster factory.  
I suggest you change the format of the letter. You have to scroll about 15 miles per line, a-la notepad.

Firstly, that isn't how you use the word 'boon'. Or the word 'garnish'. And I think you mean 'prioritize'. And come on, this is the 21st century. You don't need to put the word cool in quotation marks.

Secondly, I wouldn't be so quick to mock her for 'internet fame'. Denying that she is a serious political thinker is counter-productive. Also, don't write the young people who post in /r/politics and like memes off. They were a big reason why the Democrats won in 2008.

I hate to be so blunt, but you come across as quite a snotty and unpleasant person, and touches like capitalizing the 'American Dream' and constantly referring to 'American citizens' make you come across as sanctimonious too. Based on the way you write I'm finding it hard to believe that you are actually a CEO who employs 1000 people.

tl;dr: Remember kids, proofread your emails before you click send!
I'm not a CEO (surprise), I was writing it from the viewpoint of a CEO. 
fixed the formatting, I tried to paste from MS word initially. 
fixed the grammar errors

I wrote this in the tone that I thought a CEO that has worked his/her ass off to get where they are would probably take after reading Warren's statement. I'm all for paying it forward, don't get me wrong, but I think that we're asking the wrong people to do so.  
Ron Paul has support of many people that have chosen the democrat over the Republican choice in the 2 Party scam sElection system we are so lucky to even be allowed to participate in.
It's bad because the costs that we would have to support via taxes, etc are too damn high. The cost of medical care and college educations are downright ridiculous.

I can't fathom how high the taxes would have to be to support a system similar to what you experienced.
I highly doubt that a guy/girl who has worked their ass off to set up a company which employs 1000 people would adopt such a petulant, whiny tone. You don't get very far in the world without treating people (especially intelligent and well-regarded people like Warren) with such disrespect whether you agree with them or not.

PS. You'll always be a CEO to me! RES tag activated.
You are missing the point of her speech. Sure you got to where you are through hard work. Great work and awesome job and you certainly deserve a lot of the profit. But what you fail to realize is that is was not only your work. Your employees, the construction workers who made the roads that you use for your factory, other public workers all made what you did possible. They created the environment for your success, and as part of this underlying social contract, they deserve a small part of what you did.  

She is not saying that you did not work to create the factory. She is simply pointing out that you were not the only one who helped build your company's success. 
That says its from 2009 - 2017 and it includes projections. But I have never seen that graph before and cannot vouch for its authenticity.
i don't think they should provide much besides social security otherwise we're just wasting out money on people who could get it on their own but are just too lazy.

P.S. i no way do i think all people in medicare and welfare are just lazy but some are too "proud" to get the bad jobs when they should just take them if they want money and then there are others that are just too lazy and abusing the system some people really do need this but the government is still yet to find a highly effective way to do this so i want much less government programs.
You don't win elections by getting the opposing party to vote for your candidate, that thinking is simplistic. You win by getting your whole party to turn out and some independents to side with you. Gary Johnson would lose a helluva lot more Republican votes than he would gain Democratic. I'm a Democrat and I sure as fuck wouldn't vote for him or Ron Paul. 

Governor Johnson does have the fortune of being totally sane and pretty smart but why would I ever think of voting for someone that would champion the Republican platform? I might agree that he is awesome for a Republican but I am a Democrat which I suspect the OP is as well.


I'm not saying you're wrong... but I think by eliminating governemnt programs because of abuse, you're gonna throw the baby out with the bath water. Even if 45% of people on welfare abuse the system (which isnt the case, but bare with me) there are 55% of people that actually do use and need that helping hand. 

I think you're forgetting the awesome power of the federal governemnt and what it can accomplish. The Federal Highway system could never happen if taxes were as low as you want. The Hoover dam would never have been built nor the Tennessee Valley Authourity. Did you know that even in the 1940's many communities didn't have access to electricity? It wasn't worth it to Edison to string power lines to rural communities. If it werent for the infrastructure that the government built, we wouldnt have this internet that were communicating with. 

I can understand the desire for less governemnt... but I feel that the time for small government passed when more people lived in cites than on the farm. A substance farmer or a guy that grows wheat for a living doesnt need much federal governemt involvment in his life. 

However, an accountant living in LA (me) needs the federal interstate system to get to work, I work with OSHA to keep me safe at the office, I work with transportation so I need the DOT to keep the roads safe when I transport haz waste. I need the port inspectors to deliver the raw materials to my site. To go to school I needed to borrow from Federaly backed student loans. 

So personally don't want the size of the federal government to shrink becuase I use it almost every day. 

I personally think that the USA should move to a more federal system of government and that the individual states should have less power... but I am a radical like that.  (And that is a discussion for another day)
so i guess you got me with the taxes portion i will be the bigger man however i still do think we need less government so as you said that is another conversation for another day.

But HOW would people leech off of free healthcare? would you give yourself cancer just so you can get free treatment? Even with our leech friendly system in the UK it still costs less than the US healthcares system per person by many factors.
[deleted]
why dont we just give them all our money, because they can help society better and have the right

I dunno.  With some hard work, I could.
Okay, so is society perfect right now? I think it is not. I see where nearly 50% of people don't make enough money to actually pay income tax. They are paid that poorly! I see Texas where 25% of people have zero health insurance. 

So, how will letting people not be taxed help these things? 
But what obstacles are in place that you would have to overcome?  
Plays violin while titanic sinks
I'm not saying it's not full of obstacles.  I'm saying that if you put your mind to it, you can jump over them.
You're creepy.
Take CA for example, do you know how much money you're obligated to spend for surveying the land?  
you never win if you are worried about your enemies liking you.
would that bother you?
ANti-corporate or anti-business or anti-monopoly and greed?  I think the pre-conceived notions of republicans you appear to have should be re-examined, and then feel free to adjust your questions and re-submit. 
 Yeah. But, then again, I'm not from around here.
It would make me laugh, are you saying its true ?  Or are you trying to be smart ? 
Solution: join the democrats subreddit and hassle them.

It encourages immigration and contributes to demographic change in France.
First off, thank you for taking the time to read my letter. 
Second, what did you not like about it?
Third, I've read all of your comments from other posts and I don't think you should be calling anyone a rambling lunatic. 
As a financially conservative liberal I'm still learning towards being against.

While your story is a highlight of how awesome welfare and publicly support systems can be in bettering the life of someone who in turn can better others in the future.  The concern that I (and people who I know are hardcore against it) is that in American I just don't see your story being the common case, instead it being people taking advantage of it for their own gain with no intention on trying to help others out in the future.  

Given the general corruption and greed of our government, we need any possible tax revenue, and the chance that people across the board could abuse and con the system makes me very weary of it at the moment.  If America could actually do something to remove its political officers with people that aren't greedy rats I think i would support it more, but until then my paranoia wins out.
I doubt Perry would survive the vetting process the Democrats will put him through.  The Republican opposition is still playing with their gloves on but even those will be dropped as the nomination gets closer.  Perry has a dedicated following but he has to gain more to win and the cracks will show before then.    
The best part about his potential nomination is a change in the dialogue that would occur.  How long are we going to last with the same old arguments that haven't lead to solution or compromises?

At least having Paul seemingly come from left field (at least in relation to current politics) would make people think about different issues or the same problems we have had from a different angle.
I'm Australian. My Bachelor's degree at a public university will end up costing me about $18,000, which will be a 0 interest loan which I will only be required to pay once I am earning $40,000 a years. As of next year I will not have to pay any income tax as those making less than $18,000 will be exempt. If I seek care at a public/socialized hospital I don't have to pay a dollar - that includes whatever surgery you can think of. If I need a surgery which is not urgent I will have to wait about a year, though I can just go to a private hospital and pay a bit more. I went to a privately owned GP and pharmacy recently, after state rebates it only cost me about 20 dollars for medication and a diagnosis.

Total socialization of health and education certainly works, though the private/public synthesis I have been living with all my life is great too. I don't understand why American can't hit the middle ground like we have here. When private business has to compete against state-provided services prices plummet, which causes the provision of those services by the state to be less costly.
Hey, you blacked out Ron Paul, you MSM bastard! For the record he's a 6%.
Yep. Behind Gingrich, Bachmann, and Cain. 
Cain's a top tier guy now. Didn't you hear he won the Florida straw poll?
That upper tier is starting to get crowded. I think they'll have to build a new tier so winners like Perry and Romney don't feel so crowded. 
Bring on the primaries!
as a historian or American History, i assure you that the George W. Bush presidency will go down as one of the worst presidencies in the United States, I am not saying the worst...that is Warren Harding, but Bush was by no means a better president than his father, Reagan, Clinton or Obama. 
Reagan was better, clinton slightly better, his dad worse, obama much worse.  Give some concrete reason obama is better.
CA as in California?  Pfffpfftffttfpfpfff.... xD
The crowds laughed at Ron Paul when he ran in 2008, but no more. Now people are looking at Ron because he knows how to fix this country while Ben Bernanke is admitting he doesn't know why his policies aren't working. 

Ron Paul isn't our last hope, Rand Paul is, but it might be too late if we have to wait for Rand to run. 
I saw Ron Paul in 2007 on the stage in the debate shaking his finger at the rest of the candidates that were all parroting the same positions. That got my attention. 

Ron Paul is a threat because he wants to challenge our central banks. There is a long bloody trail of U.S. presidents that have been assassinated or targeted for assassination for issuing currency instead of giving power to the central banks. JFK was going to take the right to issue currency away from the Federal Reserve. James Garfield challenged the Federal Reserve and was assassinated. Lincoln took the printing press from the central bank and he listed the banks as a more formidable enemy than the South. Andrew Jackson opposed the central bank and the bankers tried to have him assassinated too. 

The media blackout of Ron Paul just illustrates the power and influence of the privately owned Federal Reserve and the banking elite imho.
The policies of George Bush shit all over us and Obama is just continuing most of Bush's policies. I'm referring to fiscal policies, foreign policy, the size and scope of government, energy policies,....

Everything this administration has done to ease the pain has just made the situation last longer. The best thing Obama could do is to let the losers in the market go bankrupt instead of propping them up.  If we do not have risk vs rewards then investors will take too much risk and the bail outs will never end. If the government chooses winners and losers then we don't get the best products, we get crony capitalism and corporate welfare instead. 

Spending isn't the best way of getting out of a recession and Obama along with the Federal Reserve are proving that now. Lord Keynes is now receiving a smack down in economic circles &gt;=)
I feel like Ron Paul is the only guy running for office that truly gives a shit about regular people. His positions on most things are right on point. Especially the fiscal stuff.

That said, some of his domestic policy is just too naive for me to truly support him as a presidential candidate. But i'd still vote him over Obama. 
The jews won't be "run out" - some might, but as a political entity? They will die. But not before turning the middle east into glass. And Russia.

Their second strike capability is immense and I take them more serious than I do someone like North Korea or Iran.
I like most of what he has to say. But he loses me on foreign policy. You can't abandon all foreign embassy's worldwide and pull all of the troops home.
The middle-east would hate us whether we're there or not. 

I voted for him last primary. Not sure who has my vote this time yet. Perry, Gingrich, cain.. I need to see more debates
Poor people aren't paying taxes at all right now. 47% of the country pays $0 right now. 

Obamacare won't save money, it'll cost trillions. Repeal that.. Lowering corporate tax rates will encourage them to hire or invest in their business. Eliminate pensions for government employees, most private sector jobs don't have these perks, why should cushy government jobs. Stop extending unemployment, the longer you extend unemployment, the longer people will suck from the teet.. When times are tough, you have to take whatever work you can, stop holding out to make exactly what you made before the recession at the taxpayers expense.. Make "Social Security" optional. If people feel their not smart enough to manage their own retirement, they can use the crutch. Setup private account in every citizen's (Not illegals) names, that they pay into and can invest however they want. This money cannot be touched, borrowed from etc. Audit the fed as ron paul says - one man playing wizard behind the curtain with a nations money isn't right.

There are a lot of other good ideas in this forum. Any left-wingers that happen to check this thread, keep an open mind. Read, learn, form your own opinions, don't let the media tell you whats right, who's to blame, or who to vote for. 
Every politician for the last 60 years has cried for infrastructure improvements during their campaign and bridges are still in disrepair. Obama did this in his campaign, and his first two stimulus's for shovel ready jobs were supposed to make a big dent in it. Did it work? No. Politicians say one thing and do another. Its depressing, but once you realize this, you can see past the rhetoric.
Lol, so vote republican! 

As I get older and more conservative, I can imagine myself becoming more and more alaigned with the republican party... What will always prevent me from ever voting for them is the fact that they don't think homosexual are real people deserving of civil rights. The fact that the current crop of people campaigning for president are saying they want to strip homosexuals of rights and prevent them from getting more, has prevented me from voting for any R for the next 20 years at least. 
I didn't say that. Both sides have campaigned on improving infrastructure. Both fail to follow-through on the promise.
&gt; Poor people aren't paying taxes at all right now. 47% of the country pays $0 right now.

I think the reason for this is that poor people don't make enough money to pay taxes. Currently a family of 4 has to make more than 26,400 a year to actually meet the threshold to pay taxes. Currently 31.7% of households in the USA make less than that amount. I think more people will be willing to pay taxes if they were paid more... 

&gt; Obamacare won't save money, it'll cost trillions. Repeal that.. 

Currently 25% of Texans and 20% of Californians do not have health insurance... is this acceptable to you? I am not okay with this, but I can understand where people have different points of view. If you are not okay with 20% of Californians not having health insurance, what do you think the state or the federal government should do to help provide it? Or do you think that it is the Public sectors interference with insurance that is causing people to not afford/be willing to purchase health insurance? 

 I personally think that The Health Care Reform act is a bloated mess too, but I think the reasoning for that is that it doesn't go far enough. I want medicare for all... Private insurance will still be out there for those who want it; but with Medicare for all, everyone will be covered and hospitals can get paid when a poor person has an emergency. 

&gt; Lowering corporate tax rates will encourage them to hire or invest in their business.

Currently taxes are the lowest they've been in the last 35 years... how much lower do you want them to go? Why is it that when taxes were higher in the 90's that the USA underwent the longest sustained GDP growth ever in its history? Why were corporations better able to hire and invest when taxes were higher, but now scream poverty?

&gt; Eliminate pensions for government employees, most private sector jobs don't have these perks, why should cushy government jobs.

Government employees, when comparing apples to apples, are paid less than the private sector. An accountant 1 with 5 years experiance working for the IRS is paid about 10,000 less than an accountant 1 working for the private sector. Lots of the the numbers thrown around aggregate private and public sector jobs and when they do that... the public sector looks like they are paid more. The problem is that the state doesn't have millions of McDonald's employees on their payrolls to bring the numbers down. The public sector generally hires professionals and office workers as opposed to people who sling tacos and dig ditches... Plus, what is wrong with pensions? I think that labor has slipped in the last 30 or so years and allowed the elimination of defined benefit plans... I think that pensions are a good thing and help people plan retirement outside the variables of the market, and that labor should fight to bring them back.

&gt; Stop extending unemployment, the longer you extend unemployment, the longer people will suck from the teet.. When times are tough, you have to take whatever work you can, stop holding out to make exactly what you made before the recession at the taxpayers expense.

Unemployment is insurance not the dole. Every company pays into unemployment insurance and the payments come out of that fund. If your house were to burn down, would you refuse payment from the insurance company to rebuild? Yes, there is some fraud going on with UI, and people are not looking for work while living on it, but that doesn't mean you throw out the baby with the bath water. I am a trained accountant. That is where I benefit companies and society the best... why should I get a job that pays 1/4 as much digging ditches? I would be paid less doing that than being on unemployment... and I would quit the ditch digging job as soon as an accounting job opened up. That doesn't benefit the ditch digging company, my self or my landlord and local business. I would have to move to a place where rents are cheaper and sell my car and ride my bike to work. It is an inefficient way for the market to operate. 

&gt; Make "Social Security" optional. If people feel their not smart enough to manage their own retirement, they can use the crutch. Setup private account in every citizen's (Not illegals) names, that they pay into and can invest however they want. This money cannot be touched, borrowed from etc.

In my opinion this is the worst idea here. I have a degree in finance, I work with numbers all day long. I pay attention to the stock market and I wrote an "A" paper on how it works in college... and I feel that I am not smart enough to manage my own retirement. Half of all people have IQ's less than 100. If we allowed people to plan their own retirement, how many shysters out there will take advantage of them... we hear about Bernie Madoff who bilked the rich and famous out of $65 billion dollars... people who should know how to invest and handle their money... Madoff had a dog and pony show that took their money! imagine if normal people could control their own retirement... people would be starving in the street! (Which is why SS was part of the New Deal, old people were starving in the streets.)

Once again, if you're okay with people being masters of their own destiny, and that if people didn't plan on retirement they deserve to starve, you are entitled to your opinion and vision of society. But, I ask you... what do you think society should do with the millions of Senior Citizens who will have no means to support themselves? 

I am really interested in your opinions, you seem to be rational and intelligent. I am looking forward to your response to my counter points. 

Haha, okay. so be cynical of politicians! Vote Green!
You tell em, send that weird man back to Indonesia!

I think reading a well-informed debate is worth a thousand books that jerk you off with your own ideals.  I consider myself on the left side of the political spectrum and came here just today to try to learn more about the right.  I am in no way set in my ways because I simply don't have enough information.  

That being said, I very much hope that bigbangthe0ry, or another informed conservative comes back and continues this discussion.
I agree. I was always taught that if you can't defend an argument from both sides then you don't really understand it.
That's a great thing your community did and your family is very lucky for that kind of support, but that's not a given for everyone in need. Our country has the means to take care of ALL its citizens and we choose not to. The way that the lower class and impoverished are treated in our country compared to other well-off western countries is shameful.
In case you haven't been paying attention, France is on the brink of economic failure and will need the German banks to bail them out. That's why the welfare system is bad. It is economically unsustainable because the beneficiaries do not pay into the system commensurate to the money they take out and it takes the resources away from those who could produce higher returns. 

For every 1 doctor that the welfare system produces, a free market system can produce 10 without taking it out of someone's pocket.
you actually think people in other countries are less greedy than we americans?  you are sadly mistaken.  its like this everywhere(the greed i mean) but being in and from america we dont hear about it as much
.
An **s**. *Obviously.*
Lol, I guess I asked for that. You guys can stay split into two sub-reddits if you want. I was just asking if there is a substantive difference, or did someone maybe create one of them without knowing the other one existed, or what?
/r/Republican is moderated by a white nationalist trying to promote his own personal agenda. [Look at mayonesa's posting history](http://www.reddit.com/user/mayonesa). He mods /r/tea_party too.
Cool, thanks!
Mayo is in the 3-year club; I can't click all the way through the history, but I can def see the trend. Is there a way to sort by oldest first, or some other way to see who starts sub-reddits?
I don't think he started /r/republican. It looks like the original mod burritoman stopped using reddit and mayo asked the reddit admins to add him as a mod.
...or maybe mayonesa IS burritoman!!
Nice try, but you got some things wrong. Please, read up on basic macroeconomics before you say anything. Spending IS the best way to get out of a recession. Yes, WWII spending counts as govn't spending. Just at a larger scale than FDR's scaled-back program (sound much like our puny stimulus...?! Read the history books, please.) Obviously, what we spend money on counts. Stuff that lasts us a while.... stuff like.... INVESTMENTS! YES! Let's see... education? infrastructure? new industries??? 

Immigration is not really an issue (seriously, just look at the numbers) it's just one of those divisive points that freaks people into voting for the one side that decides to exploit fears. 

And your comments on healthcare... sigh. Again, please read up on health economics. making health coverage universal WOULD lower costs especially under a single-payer system... it's not a chicken-and-egg thing here... one directly leads to the other. You're calling for an increased level of fragmentation of our healthcare system... THAT'S what drives up costs... believe me, I study this shit... your other points are fine, I guess...
I had assumed /r/republicans is where you talk about republicans, and /r/republican is where republicans talk.

I imagined there would be a lot of overlap, since this is Reddit, so I visit both... though I'm not a Republican.  I've also noticed a lot of posts pointing to Occidentaldissent, which is a self admitted pro-white anti-everyone-else website.  =/

The guy who runs the website goes by two names for some reason, possibly to hide his identity from the public.  I debated him pretty thoroughly via email and while he has a reason for believing what he does, he's arrived to the wrong conclusions.
No, spending by gov't has never worked for getting out of a recession.  I'm sure the macroeconomics text books state this is not true, but then again the text books on capitalism state that a recession is not possible with capitalism...  Spending on war does not count, unless your solution to recession is just fund wars.  They only way for gov't. spending to solve a recession is for the spending to not stop, in which case the gov't is now a member of the private work force and there goes capitalism.  I did not say universal health care would not lower costs, I said our level of care, the potential level possible, would drop with universal healthcare.

&gt;Read the history books, please.

Not sure what books you have read, but FDR's programs have never been seriously credited with solving the depression, at all, merely to offer hope and belief in gov't action.  In fact the depression has basically became stagnant when WWII came around, it was not improving by any leaps or bounds.  WWII saved FDR's programs from being a massive, albeit greatly positive to the morale of the country, failure.  The long term results have been great, the social programs, but they did nothing but help stop the bleeding for some people.  They did not reverse anything.  This, is basic US history.

Ron Paul and Peter Schiff predicted 10 out of the last 5 recessions.
I could only hope this were true...
worked in WWII.
No...WWII worked in WWII.  Nothing to do with the Depression.  Are you suggesting that spending for war, which certainly stimulates the economy for the DURATION OF THE WAR, is an appropriate course of action to solve a recession...start a massive war and spend?  War, on a large and successful scale,  is a phenominal economic boon.  However to tie in WWII with FDR's economic policy is incorrect.  They are separate.
sure it does. Spending for the war plus the work programs kickstarted demand and hiring that also fed demand. Demand for goods was soaring when the soldiers came home to easy jobs, got employed, bought houses and shit out kids and fed the beast. It was as self perpetuating as our recession is now.
May i ask why Paul?
every older generation says that about the younger one
Mitt Romney or the party will lose...
Spending on war does in fact count, it's simply government spending-- it's a mobilization of the economy. Sure you could get into behavioral economics, but the simple picture is putting money into the economy=putting people to work &gt;&gt; more money in pockets &gt;&gt;greater demand&gt;&gt;out of recession. You don't need a war to do this sort of mobilization-- you need political will. That's the only point I'm making about war. And yes, the only way for government solve a recession is for the spending to not stop-- to not pull out prematurely, much like what is happening now. We had the stimulus, and then before we were in the clear, all these austerity programs are passed. Same story with FDR. If you're always gonna have idiots shouting and inhibiting your progress because the recovery isn't instantaneous, then yes, government spending is sometimes not as effective as hoped. But then what is? Certainly not austerity or any of the other suggestions being tossed out there...  We're not and have never been in a pure capitalistic state-- we have a mixed economy. Govn't spending does not equate capitalism out the window... the definition of government is public, i.e. not a "private work force."

As for universal healthcare lowering the level of care, that's only a MAYBE. I see the argument, but I also see why it very likely may not be the case. Most of the health "innovations" developed and used here that make us "the best in the world (when it comes to technology)" are neither cost-effective nor very effective at all. The problem is that much of the shiny durable medical equipment that is invented not only drives up the overall cost of healthcare, (so fancy gotta have it!) but they're not tested...! The incentives for that industry is all wrong; they are not rewarded for how effective the equipment is at preventing/ treating disease, but instead on how effective their marketing campaign is. So what happens is that you get these hospital chains with public pressure to be the "best," ie most advanced technologically-speaking, so they buy millions of dollars worth of the new equipment, but health outcomes are only marginally improved or in some cases, even worse. Not to mention, these fancy machines and hospitals are only available to the people who can pay for it. For overall population health, universal health care would make 99.9% of everyone healthier, as everyone would have access to basic shit so you won't have to go to the emergency room much later when you're at death's door. Now what I'm for is a single-payer system, where hospitals and doctors can still be private, still be "innovative," but where insurance companies (which usually reduce pay and inhibit innovation among doctors and hospitals and medical equipment companies) are put out of the picture. It's still universal coverage. And basically everything's better. I mean, do you gauge "potential level of care" on the assumption that you're gonna be one of the wealthiest people who is able to afford such fancy technology? or are you gonna assume that you're gonna be like the vast majority of Americans, who constantly get screwed over by this "system" we currently have?

Well if you had read between the lines, I agree, FDR's spending programs didn't do as much as it could have; however, not only were his efforts hampered by the Conservative Coalition (many things were repealed for the sake of ideology... sound familiar?), but the programs did keep the economy from completely falling down the pit (hence the "stagnation" and similar to the current aftermath of Bush/Obama bailouts/stimulus) though it wasn't nearly expansive enough and didn't target the best things to target. But isn't long-term social health a fundamental thing, both ethically and economically? When society is more equal/ healthier, the economy is more productive and overall, better. I'm arguing that it DID do more than just stop the bleeding. We went from the Gilded Age of great inequality to the post WWII era of the greatest prosperity the world had ever known. The New Deal definitely left behind a legacy, if not in pecuniary terms, but philosophically. It became a can-do age of progressivism that lasted until the 70s.
After the war there was a great fear of the depression creeping back, to counter this, among other actions, the military was kept at almost war levels with a peace time draft( not WWII levels, but readiness for war levels.)  Obviously the USSR had something to do with this, but the spending on the military became necessary, in the polician's mind, to keep the country from a depression, hence the military industrial complex we all have come to know and love....was designed, partially, to counter act the depression from returning.  The military added another million jobs to the work force.  This is when spending on the military became part of the gov't. package to vanquish the depression for good, or so they thought was needed to vanquish the depression for good.  Truman and Eisenhower(although he later reversed....at the end of his term) greatly expanded the military.  JFK while he was not an advocate for war was a true cold warrior, LBJ was terrified to not go along with the military lest he lose support for Great Society.  The difference being spending for the depression has the goal of getting out of the depression.  Spending for war had the goal of winning the war, when you then spend for war to solve a despression you need a real reason to spend on war....something like the world wide Communist menaceand conspiracy, which we now know was not a unified, cohesive plot and, in the case of Vietnam, was a civil war.  But we decided to spend on the military, in part, to keep the economy booming and we needed an enemy worthy of our spending and fear.
ummmm yes.  The man is insane.  Next campaign stop - the psych ward.
This has been the most civil political argument I've ever read on the internet.

Congrats to both of you.
The OP makes a very convincing argument.
Maybe we're getting lazier with every generation.

Intelligence and reasonableness can not be put in the same sentence as Rick Perry.  Oh wait, I forgot, god is going to save us all.  I am a Republican to the core, and an attorney who likes to believe I possess knowledge and reasonableness, and I think the guy has the intelligence of my chihuahua.  The general public eats up his propaganda.  News flash, the mere incorporation of a business in Texas does by no means equate to the derivation of jobs.  Companies and their workers are located elsewhere.  Texas has one of the lowest paying wage rates in all of the United States.  This is not evidence of intelligence.  A liability is by definition something disadvantageous.  Misconstruing facts and relying on religious principals, when your base is not all Christian, fail to be advantageous to decreasing government intervention in people's lives and ensuring fiscal responsibility.  I am wondering if he even knows the population of his own State.  The only candidate with intelligence is Romney.  Granted he "flip-flops," but who doesn't.  
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! Hilarious.
There is no "liberal bias".... there are regular people, and conservative jerks. That is all.
I will tell you exactly why the fringe right lunatic Republicans don't like Obama. 1: He's a Democrat. 2: He's black. 3: His rhetoric opposed the corporate masters that rule the republican party. 4: Republicans are brainwashed to agree with everything, no matter how ironic or hypocritical, that their corporate masters tell them.
LOL "WWII single handedly solved the Great Depression" How? GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON THE WAR!!!! Seriously. Read some Keynes. When no public sector money is being used to inflate the economy, where will that money come from? Private sector money is there, corporations and the wealthy are sitting on over a $trillion, and simply choosing not to spend it. A tax adjustment is not going to make them spend that money. The only entity that CAN AND IS WILLING to pump money into a failing economy is the Government. It's really simple economics. 
Conservative, fringe-right Murikans hate the welfare system because they are selfish, brainwashed morons who don't understand simple economics.
"correlate the diction of NASCAR".... LOL I love when conservatives try to sound intelligent.

EDIT: Only conservatives would think that watching corporate sponsors driving in a circle for three hours is entertaining.
Keynes was wrong...So your argument is that rich people horde their money...NOT FOR SPENDING TO ACQUIRE THE BETTER THINGS IN LIFE OR MORE MONEY, but to keep it around and swim in it like scrooge mcduck.....brilliant.
Wait a second. Why are people trying to defend politicians? Republican or Democrat, they're both politicians. They're going to tell the people what they want, then not follow through with it. Just stop fighting against each other and realize that your opinion is provided to you. If you're into politics then you truly do not understand politics.  
So in your argument's logic, no one should pay taxes because the government wastes it all. 
I'm not sure if you've noticed, but we've lost jobs since Bush enacted tax cuts for the rich. Just an FYI.
&gt;I don't mind paying taxes, 

No, I just don't think the government should be asking for more when they're not responsible with what they already have.  

Picture yourself with a 16 year old daughter.  You gave her an allowance, she spent it all.  You gave her access to your credit cards, she maxed out EVERY single one.  She asks you to take out a loan on the house to give her more spending cash.  At what point to you ask "What the hell are you spending this on?"

What? You are talking nonsense. How was Keynes wrong? No, that is not my argument... nor Keynes'.
&gt; Private sector money is there, corporations and the wealthy are sitting on over a $trillion, and simply choosing not to spend it. A tax adjustment is not going to make them spend that money.

How do you think they get this magical money?   By spending money to make money.  A tax adjustment is literally going to make them spend, sitting on money is negative wealth increase.  Interest is not growth, it is the opposite to someone who has lots of it and wants more of it.  They sit on it until they can spend and make a profit.  Public spending artificially takes the place of private spending.  The problem is then you have your gov't. entering into the private sector and competing with private companies for profit.  If you continue down this road you have an economy that is based on gov't. spending into private companies instead of a free market system.  So therefore your gov't. becomes beholden to the corporations and holds the corporation above the people....you know, like RIGHT NOW.

What ridiculous nonsense. You have no idea what you are talking about, and I suggest you take an entry level economics course that ISN'T taught by a lunatic fringe-right conservative clown. 

"A tax adjustment is literally going to make them spend." Since when? Where is all the spending after a decade of tax cuts? The private sector is not spending their money, which is WHY the economy in the US is so far in the shitter right now. Interest is LITERALLY growth, you fool. Yes, public spending HAS TO take the place of private spending when the private sector refuses to invest in the economy. How do you expect the economy to grow if NO ONE is investing in it? 

"The problem is then you have gov't entering into the private sector and competing... for profit." Where? In what industry? Other than insurance, which I don't think should be a for-profit system anyway, the gov't does not enter the market and compete with any private businesses. In fact, when the gov't spends money, it tends to be on contracts fulfilled by private companies, who compete with each other for the business, ie; building infrastructure, etc. 

If you think that a couple of percentage points of tax, which are the lowest in decades, make the difference between investing or not investing for the extremely wealthy and corporations, you are outside of reality. Your logic makes no sense, you are just saying words that you heard on Faux Newz. How is a gov't beholden to corporations if the corporations are funded by gov't money? Wouldn't that make corporations beholden to the gov't, who supplies the contracts? You're a fool. The gov't is beholden to corporations NOW because money rules the political system, and politicians need corporate and wealthy donor money to compete in elections. It's not the gov't, it's the politicians. Apologies if that subtle difference is too much for your tiny conservative brain to comprehend.
If everyone was willing to donate money for strangers' healthcare, then there wouldn't be a debate about taxing for it...
There have been huge advancements in cancer research because of donations, not government controlled healthcare. That that is the way i like it. I donate whenever i can. Its sad when we as a society have to rely on the government to support our fellow man.
Ron Paul is the front runner. I don't know how much cheerleading the corporate media have to do to make the other candidates appear like winning horses at a race to fabricate support. None but Paul have any grassroots support and shouldn't be up there. Of course, the opinions of a few rich guys that want to buy the election far outweigh the hundreds of thousands who support Paul. 

The support of 1 billionaire outweighs the support of the millions that fund the Paul campaign. Goldman Sachs vetoes the American people it seems

Bunch of corporate yes men in the media should all be stripped of their journalistic credentials.
uh....my claims are the opposite or right wing, you really should turn off the TV and read a book.  Try thinking for yourself and not the party line.  BTW I am a liberal, just not a complete fool who believes that if it has "D" behind their name, they are right.  Also I do not watch Fox news at all....ever.  You really do not see your opinions are **based** on the politicians stances and not pragmatic actual solutions.  Corp. are not evil inherently and neither are politicians, but they both are easily abused to the detriment of the whole.  As for your other points, try turning off MSNBC and actually read other view points before regurgitating someone else's view point as your own.  If you do not realize that TARP, while it was needed, was literally gov't. competing in the private sector then you are such a dogmatic believer there is not point in this convo.  Who decided who did or did not get a bailout?  Who decided how the private companies who got the money spent the money, reorganized their company etc.  The gov't.  That is the definition of competing in the private sector.  
LOL!!!

My views **are** left wing, the difference is they are not the Dem. party line.  Are you David Axelrod?!?  Think for yourself, "Faux Newz"  Get a life and stop being part of the problem.   You are no difference than Rush Limbaugh, just on the left.  You are obviously a party hack.  Here is an idea, try reading opposing view points every now and then, read basic facts without political slants, then.....formulate your own opinion instead of regurgitating someone else's.
Seems to me he said that he pays all the taxes he is required to pay and I'm going to assume that his employees are also paying taxes as well. I'm also sure the workers that build the roads also recevied payment for their efforts and in turn paid taxes.
 To say he needs to pay forward implies he needs to antie up more . Which he is free to do. Just like Mr. Buffet can change the amount he cares to call income is and therfore be taxed more, or he can also freely write a check. Forceing either of this men to pay more because they earn more is wrong if they are paying all they are legally required to pay. If you and Warren would like to join together to have the laws changed feel free to do so. As the "pretend" CEO of the letter is free to do as well, to ask for a higher tax, less credits etc.
france can eat a dick.. how about you STFU and repay us for WW2 and the Marshall Plan? 
I'm saying I don't care what people wear or do in their lives as long as it doesn't have any affect on their ability to govern.  Let me guess, you're an anti-government pro-occupy wall street, flea party wannabe hipster?  And the first joke you have about a Republican is to accuse him of being a cross-dresser?  Like that affects his work or will change someone's' attitude about Boehner.  What's your agenda here? Left? right? middle? spoon?
Well the dress would put judgement in question, unless it was fashionable. I agree with everything you said- but i'm still going to punch your dumbass  mother in her dumbass mouth. Your sister has AIDS.
Just read about how he had no idea what the Israel/Palestine bullshit is all about. Finally a clear thinking grown up who is really to work for America and let Jews and their Semitic cousins the Arabs deal with their own stupid shit. 
Party line? LOL How am I towing the D party line? Obama and his Republican-light administration are not for any of the things I am suggesting. The Democratic party is as worthless as the Republican party at this point. I never said corporations are inherently evil, but it is true that the only thing hat corporations care about is the profit margin. It's not their fault, they have no choice. It's how corporations work. My point was simply that there is money to be spent in the Private sector, but they are not spending it, and no tax decreases will ever spur them to spend. In this situation, the ONLY entitiy both willing AND capable to pump money into the economy is the gov't. If I'm wrong, please explain where this "magical money" will come from. 

TARP was not the gov't 'competing' in the market in any way, shape, or form. It was an ill-conceived bailout for the banks. It was certainly interference in the market, but it had no net effect on competitiveness since the money was available to all the major banks who needed it. They gov't had virtually no role in deciding how the money was spent, which was one of the major problems with TARP. Giving an entire sector of the economy a bailout is not "the definition of competing in the private sector". 

BTW, I don't even have cable, and I wouldn't bother watching/reading mainstream news sources anyway.

If you are a "lefty" it only goes to show how far to the right the US has moved in the past decade.
What an awesome rant with absolutely zero attempt at even making a point, or stating an idea. How am I towing the D party line? What are you talking about? Whose opinion do you think I am regurgitating? Give me a break.

LOL!!!!  Typical uninformed American.

&gt;If I'm wrong, please explain where this "magical money" will come from.
y point was simply that there is money to be spent in the Private sector


It is bad, because this system is a bubble that uses achievers, but it penalises them. When the number of achievers will drop the socialistic system will collapse as did the Roman Empire.
LOL indeed. Just because I don't watch mainstream news does not make me uninformed. I'm also not American ;)
he's so crazy its not even funny
[deleted]
&gt;I'm also not American

So where is your opinion based from?  If you do not view American news sources, what non American media?  Not paying attention to American news sources for American news means you are the definition of uninformed on American politics.  I could probably ramble off a dozen things about your country that I get from American sources that are either gross exaggerations or an outsiders ignorant perspective, but I would at least not assume I know more about that countries political happenings than people in that country do b/c I read blogs and subjective, partisan news.

I find it amusing that you can't differentiate between American news sources (which I enjoy regularly, as well as non-American sources) and Mainstream American news sources (such as cable/network news, which I don't bother with). 
If it doesn't make it out of the house, you can blame republicans. If it doesn't make it out of the senate, you have to blame Reid.

Can you try a least a little to have some civility?

Mainstream American news sources implies..no MEANS network news, CNN, MSNBC, Newsweek, Al Jazeera, Time magazine etc.  The reason they are mainstream is b/c they all may have their slants but they, generally, are accurate.  This idea that mainstream media is in bed with corporations and curruption is certainly not an outright lie, but if they were as bad as people on reddit think....they would not exist.  With the exception of some of Fox News and some of MSNBC, they have to balanced to an extent just to continue to exist.  Daily I, see much more egregious lies, exaggerations and complete partisan spin jobs by online blogs and sources like Salon.com, Huffington Post etc.  Those sournces are completely partial and not after the truth, but the truth as they like to see it presented.  What news sources do you use?  Mainstream does not equal false or slanted.  Non mainstream does not equal truth and righteousness.  I decide what I think is righteous or not, I just want the info. to make my decision.
Al Jazeera is not a mainstream news source, and although I don't read AJ regularly, they are the best source for international news. You don't seem to understand the meaning of the word “mainstream”. Typical of an American to not understand the words that you use, so let me explain. The reason the “mainstream media”is considered “mainstream” is NOT b/c they “are generally accurate”. LOL They are mainstream, because that is where the majority of people get their news. Mainstream media is LITERALLY in bed with corporations, and are in fact owned by some of the biggest, most powerful, corporations in the world (News Corp, GE, etc). The non-partisan “balance” of CNN, etc, is worse than the blatant partisanship of Faux Newz or MSNBC because they pretend there is a false equivalency between the right wing and the left wing. There isn't. The right wing is comprised of lying scumbags and racist morons with no ideas, and the left wing is demonized for everything they believe in (ie: being good people) and never fight back against the Republican hate machine. I don't waste my time with any of those news sources, and since this was supposed to be a discussion about economic policies and ideas, I'm not sure why we're wasting our time talking about how useless the mainstream media is. If you want to talk economics, I read economists that I believe have the right ideas, like Stiglitz, Krugman, Sen, Yunis, Rodrik. I also have a degree in International Development Economics, I'm not pulling shit I learned on wikipedia out of my ass. 

You have yet to respond to my original question, which is simply “WHO is going to pump money into the economy to break out of this recession if not the government?” The private sector clearly isn't, because the biggest “American” corporations are sitting on over a trillion in capital reserves. The banks aren't lending, so it won't come from them. So where will the money come from, if not the government? Answer that question for me. We know for a FACT that lowering taxes does not spur spending (see the past decade), and we know for a FACT that higher taxes do not have a negative effect on economic growth (see the 1940s-70s). I won't hold my breath.
Damn this is two weeks old hopefully you reply. I am curious about the $40,000 mark. Say youre making $39,000 a year and your boss wants you to give you a $2,000 raise. Do you tell them not to do it if it means you'll have to spend $3,000 next year paying off the loan?

Im just pulling numbers out of a hat here. The $40,000 trigger sounds weird to me. Seems like it should just be a percentage of any income. But not necessarily a targeted mark.
&gt;WHO is going to pump money into the economy to break out of this recession if not the government?"

I never said that would not work, but only on a temporary basis.  Is gov't. going to keep the economy afloat forever?  If corporations will not spend money now, they sure as hell will not when the gov't. will do it for them.  In that case we cease to be capitalists and become some odd form of domestic mercantilism.  I never said the programs will not *help*, but that cannot be the solution unless you want the gov't. to literally be a continuing and dominating player in the economy.  That is my point.  

&gt;The private sector clearly isn't, because the biggest “American” corporations are sitting on over a trillion in capital reserves

Do you really think this the end of global trade and capitalism as we know it?  B/c that is the result of big corporations not spending any money.  Capitalism is predicated upon free trade between entities.  If the large corp. are opting out and basically retiring on top with their money, the system of trade is done.  So how are these corp./banks paying their employees, pensions etc if they are not spending money?  Yes they are not certainly more tight with their wallets than in the past, but to close the wallet is literal suicide for a company.  Adding massive and imperpetual gov't. spending leads to an even smaller incentive for business to thrive, small and indep. businesses most of all.  

BWT Al Jazerra is certainly main stream, come on be honest.  As for the other "main stream" media being owned by corp. and Al Jazerra not.  [They are owned by Qatar, a country.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/05/wikileaks-cables-al-jazeera-qatari-foreign-policy)  They are massively involved in the spin and portrayal of the news viewed on there.  None of them are perfect certainly, but Al Jazeera is close to a state run propaganda machine.  They are more subjectively anti-American than Fox news is right wing or MSNBC is left wing.  


No, it's their job to report the news, they aren't doing that when they actively avoid talking about a candidate. 
At this point is looks like Rick Santorum may win the Iowa Caucuses.
You said that tax breaks would “literally make them spend” and that Keynes was wrong. Keynes suggested that in a recession, the state should increase spending to compensate for the lack of private investment, and when the economy picks up, increase taxes to build up a surplus (to spend during an economic downturn). Keynes didn't say that the gov't should prop the economy forever. From your general thought process, however, I don't think you actually know anything about what you are discussing. 

“If corporations will not spend money now, they sure as hell will not when the gov't. will do it for them.”  What? This is nonsense. The gov't wouldn't be spending money “for” corporations.... do you understand how businesses work? Do you understand how the gov't works? Domestic mercantilism? LOL What are you talking about? Your whole argument is a straw-man. No one is suggesting the gov't take over industry and be the “dominating player in the economy”, just that the gov't should inject capitol into the hands of the people who actually need it and will spend it (ie: the homeowners, not the banks). 

Another ridiculous straw-man. Of course I don't think that this is the end of global trade and capitalism... why would you even suggest that? I never said corporations aren't spending any money, I said that they are sitting on a lot of money that they aren't spending. At least not in the US. Why would a big corporations invest in the US economy right now? What's the incentive? The biggest incentive is to wait until Obama loses next year with the economy still in the shitter, so the Republican President can pass all kinds of “pro-business” (aka anti-consumer, anti-environment, anti-labour) de-regulations That being said, obviously they are still producing their widgets and paying the employees they haven't fired yet. Producing some widgets is still profitable, but building a bigger widget factory is not. There is low demand, and so there is low supply. Economics. Wow. You will boost one by boosting the other in the aggregate, but it is a risk for individual suppliers to try and boost demand by increasing supply on their own. Only the gov't can invest across the board, directly hiring people, and increasing cheap available capitol for businesses, which will have a much better chance of increasing demand.

Imperpetual is not a word, but if you mean perpetual spending, then I agree, and so does 99.9% of everyone else. No one is in favour of perpetual government propping of the economy. But that is a big jump from unfortunately necessary stimulus spending during a massively long recession. 

Al Jazeera is not mainstream in America, that is a ridiculous statement. I have certainly watched enough AJ to know that they are far from a state propaganda machine. They have there views, like everyone, but they report much closer to the truth than any American network. They are not anti-American, they are just not pro-American. There is a big difference, but clearly many Americans can't differentiate between the two.
 

Although the Australian dollar is at the moment equal to America's, our much higher wages don't mean much considering we have much, much higher prices and so what might seem like a great deal of money per annum is not really so. If you are working full-time just about anywhere you can expect to earn at least $50,000 unless you are doing a rather mundane job such as cleaning or low-tier retail. 

I think then that the 40,000 mark makes it so that you will start paying when you begin working full-time, but not if you are un/under-employed.  Once you do hit the trigger, the loan is paid back at zero interest through the taxation system, with the amount being proportional to your income (at $40,000 you only pay $1,600, which would make a $2,000 raise worthwhile). I think then it is just set as such so as to avoid laying an unwieldy tax burden on low-income earners.

Maybe it is set arbitrarily, but I will never have bills coming in telling me that I need to pay back a chunk of the $100,000 I owe for my liberal arts degree. 

I still think the democrats way of dealing with the economy is dead wrong; but after reading this analysis, I'm not particularly happy with Cain's plan now. Is this blog correct? Or is there something it's missing that's scaring me away?
I would imagine any attempt to overhaul the tax code would be a work-in-progress.  Its his vision you are buying anyway. Considering he would have to get it through congress.  Admittedly, I think the burden on the lower income brackets would be too much under his plan.  But his vision is one of growth and it is changing as it becomes scrutinized.

I've always flirted with the idea that a 0% corporate tax with a very steep progressive income-tax would be interesting.  Something along the lines of above 250,000 to 500,000 the rate would increase steeper, I would argue as high as 80% for people making 10 million or above.

Seems radical I know but if you think that corporate taxes are only passed down the the end consumer it would make sense.  Also, capital could be kept at the corporate level and could be used for corporate investment and higher salaries for lower workers.  Obviously we have no guaranee...High CEO pay would be less of a concern because they would be taxed at a higher rate. Mix with that mandating voting rights for shareholders of publicly traded companies to regulate CEO pay I think we could balance out this disparity of wealth thing going.  Solve the problem the OWS people are protesting but don't even know they are protesting.

Edit: Troll downvoter, no comment.  Coward. Lulz.
Idk.  Its been on my mind, anyone else?

tl;dr I think I may have just hijacked your comment.  Sorry.
I love trolls, they make me feel so much better about myself. It's like walking past a hipster.

No it's okay, any kind of discussion is good as I'm taking this election more seriously than the last one. I'm hovering between Romney or Cain as both of them have lots of private experience and espouse less regulation. My wife and I are heavily involved in the study of business (her more than me, I'm just a speech comm and poly sci major) and everything we're learning suggests that what the current administration is doing is what is causing our recession to continue. But my study is very basic, as in Management styles and entrepreneurship 101 type stuff so anyone who knows more and can clarify is welcome to comment.

That's why I've been thinking about voting for Cain, he wants to lower certain taxes and decrease regulation. That applies directly to what I've learned that regulation and uncertainty in the market lessens the possibility for growth because large companies hold onto their cash and small business can't grow or even start because banks aren't lending. I also know that assumption only scratches the surface though.

Personally though, I'm only concerned about his plan to eliminate tax credits, as that was my family's saving grace when I was a child. There were five of us and my father worked overtime just to keep us living comfortably, but one car being totaled or a large expense because of a house problem would have been a big problem except for that child tax credit giving us some help.

It's a tough decision. I've heard on here that he also only got Godfather's Pizza off the ground because he had some inside help in the Fed banks around his town. But that's r/politics for ya so I'm taking that news with a grain of salt.
I understand being concerned about losing tax breaks.  Though I think on a macro level, if you had lower corporate tax rates, you would have a lower cost of living.  Cable tv going down, commodities, car repairs.  Not immediately, but over time competition would be able to offer prices at a lower level without a higher tax burden.  So you might have some breathing room even if you were to lose the deductions for children.

I haven't heard about the Cain/fed bank.  Though unless they were giving him free money, a low interest loan still requires work to pay it back.  I don't think it harms his position too much.
That is true. I guess my only caveat now would be that there would be some magic guaruntee that the cost of living would go down, because even though I'm a staunch conservative, I have no faith in the upper tax bracket in giving us plebs a break just because they're making a profit.

What I believe (with my limited knowledge) is that with his plan we would benefit from an increase in entrepeneurship from regular people. I have had 3 jobs in my short life. My first one was at Taco Bell working for a small amount above minimum wage. My second one was working at Kmart for minimum wage because they are STILL going under and couldn't give me a raise anyways. But my third job was going to pay me ten dollars and hour for simply cleaning condos. TEN! That was like mana from heaven to my ramen infested stomach. And with me and my wife both working for that amount we would be rolling in the dough (at least in terms of what we thought was good money). But then the recession occurs and we had to be let off because of the decrease in sales in the tourist area I worked. I was also almost hired to be a producer at a local radio station, that one was put on hold because of the recession and the owner's concern that an increase in regulation and obamacare would up his costs. What that proved to me was that I was getting treated better and paid more by a small business. So I'm all for opening the spigots of credit and profit in a responsible way.

It's very frustrating to see our government debating something so simple. It all comes down to getting rid of uncertainty. I am graduating from what Wonkette called a "hick, redneck" college and even I get what's going on. What should that tell you about the OWS?
I'm sure they all support stem cell research. I'm sure most if not all of them do not support government funding stem cell research. The issue needs to be framed properly.
Obama, like Truman, casts Congress as foil: Heading into a tough re-election campaign, President Barack Obamaz has been railing against Congress to pass his jobs plan and casting Republicans as obstructionists who would rather score political points than help the economy rebound. It's beginning to look like the Truman show.

"If Congress does something, then I can't run against a do-nothing Congress," Obama said Thursday at a White House news conference. "If Congress does nothing, then it's not a matter of me running against them. I think the American people will run them out of town." It's about damn time, these so called Republicans are a dire danger to the world!

FACT CHECK: In foreign policy address, Romney stretches on Obama's record, a fine example of why we must defeat Republicans

FACT CHECK: In foreign policy address, Romney stretches on Obama's record: In a foreign policy speech to cadets at South Carolina’s The Citadel, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romneyz promised Friday to reverse non-existent “massive defense cuts” and pledged to deploy missiles and ships that already are largely in place. A closer look at some of his statements, and how they compare to the facts: They are called out and out lies and are a hallmark of today's Republicans!
They don't owe us for WW2. WW2 was us paying them back for the Revolutionary War. 
That is exactly what we need in this country!
That is exactly what we need in this country!
You are confused as to exactly where progress (both social and economic) comes from. Economic prosperity is a result of capital investment in the marketplace. Social change was initiated by private groups seeking to change hearts and minds on a national level. I think you meet Bastiat's definition of a socialist, in that you cannot tell the difference between society and government.

Well, one point of this subreddit is for real conservatives to call out the fake ones like Mitt Romney:

Both sides of the equation are needed. The logic in "supply-side" economics is that if rich people (and small businesses) have more money they will invest/save more, thus providing businesses with more capital to expand their operations by hiring more workers, buying more inputs, etc. If the amount of money on deposit at banks rises they will be able to provide more loans at lower rates, which again promotes business expansion but also makes it easier more consumers to buy houses and boats or what have you. Demand-side policies are more designed to increase wealth in the middle-class (favorable labor policies, government transfer programs, etc.) which is what I think you were getting at. Power has shifted between the two back and forth over the last century, the supply side becoming dominant beginning with Reagan.
People who vote in the primaries tend to be more conservative, and Huntsman is pretty moderate.
Yeah, that's mostly the idea. Would you be able to extrapolate on why we couldn't have supply side and demand side policies simultaneously? Don't both help each other, in a way?
Demand boosting "Keynesian" policies, which I think you're referring to, are really only effective in the short-term and don't really do much to help long run growth, cash for clunkers being one example. In these policies money is really just being redistributed from rich to poor (think unemployment insurance) or financed with deficit spending that will need to be paid off later. The idea behind supply-side economics is that the policies will create more wealth instead of simply changing the way it's distributed. It's the "rising tide lifts all boats" and "make the pie bigger" theory. That's why conservatives don't see as big of a problem with unequal wealth distribution, because everyone has become wealthier over time, just at varying rates.
GOP doesn't care about incredibly expensive  TEMPORARY jobs that only take more cash from the pockets of the American people to be spent on pet projects. Porkulus 2? Why weren't those bridges fixed during the last stimulus? They're shovel ready now, huh?

Why would anyone want to keep less of their pay check?  Why would you want to pay more for products at the store.  Less money to take home and higher prices at the store means you have a lower standard of living.
PauL SUCKS
capitalism gone wrong
The current administration has only lowered taxes and increased government spending.

What part do you consider to be a basic 101 mistake that is keeping the recession going?

&gt;Personally though, I'm only concerned about his plan to eliminate tax credits, as that was my family's saving grace when I was a child. There were five of us and my father worked overtime just to keep us living comfortably, but one car being totaled or a large expense because of a house problem would have been a big problem except for that child tax credit giving us some help.

Sounds like you should be against the plans of every republican in the race right now.  All of them would raise taxes on the middle and lower classes.

Well Cain now came up with 9/0/9 and nonsense about how anyone can stay on the current tax code if they want and only switch to the new one if it is better.  Essentially the guy's plans ignore that we have a budget to pay for as he doesn't seem to care about the amount of revenue his plans generate, he only cares about slogans.
That is a little naive, since when has business ever passed on a tax cut to consumers?

Look at the airline industry.  When congress failed to pass a renewal of the consumer airline ticket fees that pay for security, all the airlines raised their prices so that cost of flying would remain unchanged and they would collect more money per ticket.
What? business's don't pass tax cuts...

Edit: The airline business is heavily regulated and congress frequently requires unprofitable routes in order to sustain trips to Washington from their home states.  The airline industry frequently needs government bailouts because they are required to do so much without compensation.  When they have an opportunity to make more money with minimal consumer reaction. They take it.

In exchange for the heavy regulation, there is tons of government money flowing into airlines.  Especially when it comes to the infrastructure.

Airlines can easily make more money with the FAA funding most of the safety infrastructure than they can paying for that all out of pocket in exchange for the right to allow passengers to sit on the tarmac for 36 hours waiting for their flight to take off.

The airlines that cannot make money are ran like shit.  Southwest is raking in the dough while they have the best terminals for passengers and are putting internet on every plane.
I cannot follow logically where you are trying to go with this...
That claiming the regulation in the airline industry costs them money.  Which is what you claimed and is extremely false.
So requiring someone to do something doesn't cost time and effort?
Standards cost everyone much less time and effort.  Because of the FAA, airlines don't have to worry about planes crashing or falling apart in the air.  Instead they can focus on the core of their business, selling plane rides to places.  They don't have to worry about if a boeing aircraft is shit or not, boeing has to certify all their aircraft with the FAA.  The airlines know what they are buying.

Standards are a very good thing.  People want to know planes are safe and that an airline won't become unsafe just because they hired a Meg Whitman type to cut costs.

Hell just look at the rules for pilots working for more than a certain hours in a day.  If airlines had their way, pilots would be working 20+ hours a day.  The regulations limiting the time a pilot can log in a day only came about because airlines were overworking pilots and it was a safety issue.  That is how all regulation is created.  A problem is occurring and the regulations are created to ensure the problem is fixed.
You think airlines wouldn't have plane inspections and safety without the government?  When planes crash, people stop flying.  There is a direct relationship between customers and safety.  And its not like the government fixes the planes?  To think that they don't have a compelling reason to have safe planes is totally wrong.  The second planes start going down due to poor maintenance and it becomes a trend.  That airline would be out of business and sued to shit.  No more airline.

Regulations or Standards cost more because they required a totally nother person to be paid by the us tax payers to supervise a job that will already get done because otherwise, the company goes out of business.  Do we not see plane crashes because the government is involved?  No plane crashes happen.

Unfortunately that is not how all regulation is enacted, pilot working conditions are another factor.  If a pilot ever went down because he hell asleep... airline sued to shit.  Lotta money lost, potential out of business.  And again, despite these regulations, planes still go down, pilot error still happens.  Why don't we just regulate pilot error away. That would solve that.
&gt;You think airlines wouldn't have plane inspections and safety without the government? 

I don't think it.  It happened, which is why the FAA was created.  You seem to think some idealist is sitting in a closed room brainstorming ways to regulate for no reason.

All of the laws and regulation we have today are there for a reason. Something was going on that was bad that created the need for regulation.

&gt;And its not like the government fixes the planes? 

They require that planes be maintained and the records of maintenance be logged.  Another big thing to come out of this is that it shields companies from lawsuits.  If you following the regulations your liability is greatly reduced.  So rather than companies fucking up and folding while paying out large sums of money.  The are forced to spend much smaller sums up front to keep things safe which drastically reduces lawsuits and drastically reduces payouts in lawsuits.

&gt;because otherwise, the company goes out of business.

Cute.  Say air traffic was not regulated and two planes hit.  Who goes out of business?  Everyone?  What do people who rely on plane travel do in the mean time? Lose their jobs?

The fact is when an industry effects so much, regulation is necessary.  Look at the banks.  A lack of regulation allowed them to merge until they were so big that bad management doesn't just take down the bank, it takes down half of the country with it.  Before Reagan was president banks were regulated by states and regulation kept them smaller and there were many more banks.  Even more diverse than credit unions are today.  Reagan change the rules and banks merged and merged and merged into too big to fail entities that can take down the entire economy if the management of that one bank sucks.

&gt;If a pilot ever went down because he hell asleep... airline sued to shit

And if that airline was 100% of the airline business, what happens to all the industries that rely on air travel?  Do they all topple like dominos because it will take years for another airline to develop and reach the level of the bad one?

A lot of our current regulation is designed to keep society from falling apart due to a single bad business.
No republican should ever say welfare is bad, the problem is is that our welfare system is unsustainable and fiscally unsound.  We aren't going to be doing anybody any good when our social systems collapse.

I think the logical misstep is assuming that just because they can that businesses would expand. They wouldn't expand and saturate the market if the demand isn't high enough for the product. Business decisions are reactionary to the market and not the other way around. 
Well the idea is not that businesses are saturating the market in goods that consumers already have, it's that they will invest in new technologies and techniques that improve upon existing products and create demand in new markets. Just because everyone had a horse and buggy doesn't mean that nobody wanted a car. Businesses had the capital to invest in the development of a new and better product, and consumers were able to take out loans to purchase those items on credit--that's the philosophy.

Iran has terrorist operatives all over the world, they may not have accurate missiles or nuclear warheads small enough to launch yet, but they'd have no trouble exploding bombs in other countries via other means.  A lot of the weapons and explosive ordinance that we encounter in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan originated in Iran, and they are fairly public about their goal to wipe Israel (Little Satan) off the map and strike hard against the Great Satan.

Paul wants us to be friends with Iran.  He said so himself in an interview on Fox over the weekend.  Obama wanted the same thing.  It's not working out and the threat posed by an Iranian nuke is only part of the problem.  The other threat is a nuclear arms race between all of these less than friendly (even with each other) countries in the region, with their less than satisfying history of weapons stockpile security.

In my view, Iran will force Israel's hand (it's motivations being righteous self preservation), which will force our hand (our motivation being our alliance with Israel), which will force Europe's hand.  And when that happens, China and Russia (which have been almost openly assisting Iran), will have to decide what they'll do.  What we'll count on in that case is the likely-hood that their 'secret' alliance with Iran is weak enough to prevent their hand from being forced and a world war from starting.

In my opinion, we'd be pulled into a war one way or another.  If we stand up for Israel now when they need us, we have a better chance of keeping such a war from going nuclear.

Obama is not up to the job he was elected to.  He clearly has very little in the way of tangible leadership skills that any CEO would possess.  All of his  "victories" - health care, stimulus, debt ceiling - have either been straight party line votes or caving to the other side; he has never, through his own  persuasion, moved Congress and a majority of public opinion, to his side of an issue. 

Rather than focusing on policies to stimulate growth, he spent his first two years largely focused on healthcare, which in the end is going to be a Phyrric victory because he did not achieve bipartisan consensus on the solution, resulting in a party-line vote, and the next Republican president is going to overturn it. As a consequence of his misguided focus, millions more Americans are out of work, with no plan in place to get the recovery going again.

For someone who came into office on the banner of "no red or blue America", he certainly exhibits a lot of attitude and disdain for his opposition.

Finally, his Cabinet is a joke.  Holder, Napolitano, Sebelius, Chu and Geithner are all incompetent.  Clinton is a mixed bag.  Panetta is the only one who seems to know what he's doing. 

Dems - next time around, try not to let your college-age loonies grab control of the Iowa caucases and start the ball rolling on nominating someone who is inexperienced and unqualified.
Im not going to disagree with you. Many of Obama's policies have been party line votes with out much consensus from the R side of the aisle. 

But according to this article [Mitch McConnell](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40007802/ns/politics-decision_2010/t/gop-leaders-top-goal-make-obama--term-president/#.TrlfP_QUqdA) says his only goal in the senate is to make Obama a 1 term president. 

If I were a political party and I controlled one house of congress and and the ability to block any legislation in the other house though procedure and my stated goal was to make the president look bad and make him a one term president, how would I go about that? I would delay and force every thing the president does as a party line vote. I would not concede anything to him and make it seem that the president is ineffective. 

Bluejay, If you were president and your congress has said that their top goal was to make you a one term president, how will you govern?
if a parent dies and has kids; they should get salary of the parent up until they are 18. Once you reach 18 you should be on your own. I think this way they will have money to keep the house; payments etc and such. 

Of course this is with a cap of like 500K or something like that.
I have loved all the comments in r/Politics have been so centrist calm and less aggressive compared to other sites. Now I know there is a place for that on reditt. kinda makes me  :(
Clinton did the Kid tax credit. Thomas Pain suggested the idea alooooong time ago.
When apartment owners lobbied for capping property taxes everyone thought the one good thing is rents would go down. That was wrong!! Instead the price of rentals went up right after the vote in CA same in MA.The owners pocketed the profit most did not reinvest the profit either. Never assume a corporation will pass the savings along they will only do that to be competitive but first some one has to lower their prices which doesn't happen often.
"this is a country of wants, not needs. shape up because no one is gonna care about your problems here, how little or how big they maybe" 

what my uncle first said when i came to this country from ireland back in the 90s.
Oops!
Old post is old.
why you here?
Because someone replied to my ancient post.  :P
I really appreciate some the great responses here (looking at you jstr88). The thing that's missing though is tying all this theory to the real world.  If we're going to talk about raising or lowering tax rates we need to talk about what the rates are and where we want to move them to.  

If the pupose of supply side cuts is to put money in the hands of the wealthier end of society (investors), then given the huge amount of this country's wealth that is already held by the upper classes, is it really reasonable to think that they do not have sufficient money to spend on entrepreneurial investment, R&amp;D, etc?  

I guess it also comes to mind that we've had large tax cuts across the board for at least the last decade and they have not shown to be stimulative on either the supply or the demand side of the economy.
Sorry, you've got to be your own filter. I just look for the longer and more well thought out posts. Btw, liberalism is where it's at ;)
they'd be higher, but still cheaper than the combination of what we pay for taxes and healthcare, so it'd be a net benefit to institute a similar system.

I don't see how Huntsman doesn't get a bigger following. He is a smart, smart guy. A republican who does not put off liberals. Do you know how many Obama supporters are so upset with Obama, they will vote for a republican who is not nuts. The fact that Huntsman believes in science is enough for liberals to support him. His is a republican who has done well with taxes and jobs in his state, better than Romney and Perry. He's an honest man, with proven leadership in his state. We can add his foreign policy knowledge. Already he knows more about China than anyone (huh Cain!).

Huntsman is the only person who can beat Obama, a consistent and proven leader. He might be bland, but look at Sarah Palin, someone who is not bland. She's also someone who didn't finish her governor position, and has other issues- and yet she had a huge following. Makes no sense.
It is so fascinating to listen to Ron Paul in his interviews. You can watch his speeches on the house floor (which I recommend to everyone, if they want to see how a boss gives speeches). If nothing else, Ron Paul believes in strictly limiting the Government to the constitution, I don't know why people have got to hate on him for it. He isn't opposed to going to war, but he's opposed to recklessly sending young men and women to undeclared wars that go on for decades. If there was a real need to be overseas then why wouldn't Congress just declare war. Why do people think that it will be so detrimental to have a President that believes that we shouldn't let our troops die unless we are facing a serious threat to our own National security. I understand that the threat we are facing is 'terrorism' but we obviously aren't going to win this war by attempting to kill 'terrorists' while inevitably killing civilians. 

Ron Paul has also notoriously been critical of the monetary policy. He stood nearly alone in his criticism of the FED, and all along everything he was saying was true. Some people call him a prophet but more realistically he's just a free market economist, it isn't because he doesn't understand Keynesian economics but it's because he understands its fundamental flaws. Anyways, I think that the US could really benefit from taking a solid four years of restricting the Government to the perimeters of the constitution. 
One last thing, I'm a supporter of wikileaks and Ron Paul was the only Congressman to talk about how the political pressure that was put on the site was just a form of attempting to shoot the messenger, he said that the World needs more wikileaks. If nothing else, elect the guy just so that Bradley Manning can at least have the opportunity to have a fair trial and go through the proper process of the law.
M.A.D has worked so far, but there has been [numerous](http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/19589) close [calls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III#Historical_close_calls) through out [the years](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/nuclear-false-alarms.html) between nuclear armed nations.  Some where [purely accidental](http://www.globalissues.org/issue/67/nuclear-weapons#Closecalls), some where direct confrontations.  We were lucky and reasonable... but all it takes is one slip up and a nation with a bat-shit insane government to make this situation undesirable.

The point is, Iran with the bomb increases the odds of an end-of-world scenario.  This is not just a Christian belief as you so cleverly hinted at.  Iran is a country run by deeply religious people who are completely unafraid of death, and thinking they don't have the balls to do it is foolish at best.
Agreed. I would like to support Huntsman, but his social stances (particularly abortion) earn an automatic "no" from me. But I think a lot of other people would support him *if they actually had the chance to learn about him*. His simple acceptance of global climate change was enough for me to believe there might be a shred of hope left in the Republican party. One way or another, people voting for candidates who aren't retarded is a good thing.
I pity whoever actually votes for him because of this picture. 
Ex-marine, probably.
My own approach is to write my reply, and then go back and edit out all the gratuitous insults before clicking 'save'.  It makes me seem much more rational.
The point of lowering the taxes on the rich is so that the rich pay less it taxes, and who gives a fuck about the rest of us. They (Republicans) are frauds. They don't care about the economy, and they don't care about you. If you don't have a multi-million dollar a year income, and you vote Republican, you are shooting yourself in the foot so the rich can watch you dance for their entertainment.
He is ignored by the Republican press because he is not an insane, far-right lunatic hell-bent on destroying the economy. In order to be taken seriously as a Republican contender, you have to be an ignorant douche-bag, with no grasp of economics, and a hard-on for destroying Barrack Obama.
Yeah, because during the last 8 years of a Republican in office, the economy was booming. Are you fucking serious, dude? How do you not see that the Republican media is nothing but lies and propaganda?
You were wrong to ever support that corporatist, sexual predator, and fraud.
I am not voting for him
I think if you reexamine the facts, the original bailout bill was pushed through by Bush, and signed into law on Oct. 3 2008, a month before Obama had been voted into office, 3 months before he was inaugurated as POTUS. The propping up was done originally by Bush, but the fault fell to Obama.  Curious.
I'll tack on here as well. His stance on social issues is a problem for me, but having him as Pres with both houses of Congress under Democratic majorities would be most excellent.

The fact that he is doing so poorly with GOP voters make me think much, much less of GOP supporters.
I'd love to have Huntsman and Gary Johnson merge together. They both seem very level-headed and pragmatic, and I would love a blend of their social stances and foreign policy stances.

Unfortunately, I think they would both be corporatists, which is not what I want in the executive branch.
Yeah, that's the one thing that makes me hesitant about Huntsman.
except over 50% of the P.H.D. holders in America are foreign born

we have been on the brink of failure for several presidencies, the only way we butt-scoot past is to have a foreign entity own the majority of our debt

- and from recent events, what have we learned about those glean higher returns....1% is put back into economy, other 99% is hoarded, used for bribes, or spent trying to convince the American people that Bachmann is a solid future for America..

So I would pose the question, is it better to maintain the facade of solvency at the risk of other nations (for decades) or suffer an economic depression with some grace and humility.... the American realpolitik maintains neither, OP's question still stands

P.S. Medical school research grants, funding, and curriculum is HEAVILY influenced by the pharmaceutical companies and lobbyists..If someone wasn't making a fat-ass check to help pump out American doctor's to prescribe their medications and convince a dying 90 y.o. patient that he can postpone death another 20 years with a $250,000 surgery, you really think we could "afford" to produce that many licensed practitioners?

Sensationalist much?

Also you linked to a live stream. That..tends not to work on forums.
Too bad the majority of Republicans do like getting shitfaced in public ;) 
Other than what everyone else has said here, ie. health care, huge spending, hypocrisy, etc,etc. I think Obama acts as if he is some sort of mega-rockstar, rather than a politician. He's toned it down a bit, but he was riding that through his candidacy, and a newly-elected president should not be going on night talk shows. He's not a rockstar, he's our leader, and he should've acted like it.
You idiot. It was because of the irresponsible actions of the clinton administration that we have had this whole problem. Bush passed tax cuts that my family saw directly and benefited from. It was because of the democrats that lending regulations were pushed onto banks, it was the forced lending practices enacted by the democrats that encouraged irresponsible behavior. If I were a bank and I was forced to take on these loans I would try and find a way to make a profit from them too so I can't blame some of these people for doing that. I used to think that OWS had a point, but I've read and learned so much more that I've seen that the only way to help the economy and the middle/lower classes is to free up the markets. All your side wants to do is tighten the stranglehold on it. I lost a job last year because of the bull your precious ideology stand upon.

It's ironic that you say the republican media is propaganda, but when you turn to any national or cable news network, you get the same liberal bias that blatently ignores the truth. Fox News may not be the best, but they sure as hell are better than the shit you think is the truth. This thread has been hijacked so I'm outta here. You liberals are disgusting trolls, go back to r/politics and circlejerk some more.
Aw, you'd be so cute if the policies you support weren't absolutely ruinous.
You're wrong for ever having liked Herman Cain in the first place.  He's never brought anything intelligent to the table, on domestic or foreign policy.  He's just another loud mouth.  He doesn't know a damn thing about anything.  And don't start on about how he's a successful businessman.  So what?  I've known lots of successful businessmen.  My father is a successful businessman.  My boss is a successful businessman.  I sure as hell wouldn't want either of these two guys to be president of the United States.  Success in business is great but it doesn't automatically qualify you to be president.

He's dumb as a brick and damn proud of it.  Nobody ever should have supported him.  Give me one good reason why anybody should?
there is actually no evidence that taxation creates jobs either way. I don't have the article on the internet, but I recieved a magazine article in my economics class (fr0m my free market professor) that stated that taxation doesnt have a very stimulatory effect either way. What really does it is lowering interest rates and transfer payments. this creates more purchasing power which increases demand which increases jobs. This is easily demonstrative. 

The debate over whether to lower taxes on the rich is actually pointless. What you are seeing when you see the two parties debate this idea is really two sects of the business community trying to debate this point amongst themselves, because this is what our political parties represent. That is it.
also one other thought: job creation is difficult regardless of what policies we institute because of the automation that has taken place in our society. Most of these debates are really rather pointless. More demand wont lead to more jobs in say, the auto industry, where robots build most of everything. Some jobs will be created, but mostly it will actually probably lead to more investment in technology, resulting in job loss. 
I think you confused this site with redstate.com.
Allow me to welcome you to the Internet.  You are obviously a newcomer in these Lands.
I'd imagine that die-hard Republicans view Jon Huntsman the way die-hard Democrats look at Joe Lieberman: as an untrustworthy centrist insider who doesn't believe in anything and is always ready to sell out the base.
I'm sad for you.
It wasn't the Republicans making a big deal about the very first Black president, it was was conservatives who were basing their opinions on his merits (or lack there-of).  In fact, you can see that some liberals were upset that [Obama isn't black enough](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1584736,00.html).  Obama's policies are completely fiscally irresponsible.  Bailouts, force health insurance, enormous deficits, etc.  There's plenty to be upset about, but it isn't solely Obama's fault either.  

Yet somehow, the race card always gets played.  It's because the opposition need to make the accusation to distract from the actual issues.  It's a common tactic to put the other person on defense and taint anything else they say. 

Democrats have done a pretty good hit job on the conservative movement.

Are you ignoring all the hate and vitriol that Bush received during his administration?

Go on....

I'm sad for every poor, ignorant, redneck clown who allows themselves to get roped into voting for Republicans against their own interests. 
How did you measure productivity during the almost two decades of high taxes?
How about GDP growth, the most commonly used measure of productivity and economic growth. 
[deleted]
You should speak up and speak out more. The Republican party could use some more moderate voices to not make the country think that the Republican Party has finally gone off the deep end.  
Wow. The hate and bias is overwhelming.
I assume you are talking about the Republican party.
On a per capita basis sure, but I would let a few pictures with some numbers fool you. 2009 numbers: Alaska which received the most funding per capita of any state and voted conservatively in the 2008 elections reeled in a whopping nearly $14 billion in federal funding. California which received about 10,000 per capita took in over $382 billion. Alaska's population is relatively small for such a large state. It requires a little more funding per capita to supply the resources the state would need. The overall picture it is $382 billion versus $14 billion. Let's also look at a place that is on the same population level as Alaska, the District of Columbia which has 106,000 people less than Alaska, received $83,196.12 per resident compared to Alaska's $20,351.13 which sums up to almost $50 billion for DC versus the $14 billion for Alaska.
I agree with you, I think work is good for the body and gives people confidence in themselves and gives them the energy to enjoy themselves. Just wanted to add my two cents to the "jobs Americans don't want" mantra. While I was going to college I literally worked all sorts of jobs that "Americans don't want". I find it interesting seeing the media play on this so often as an agenda for immigration. I wasn't eligible for any "free money" so I had to work these kind of jobs and as an American I am totally thankful for those kind of jobs because the income paid for my education and helped me move forward. I've worked as a farm hand, I've worked crappy night jobs, I've done that janitor type of work and rough labor with 120+ hour weeks outside in 100+ degree weather during my summer "breaks".
Who won? International corporations.
That is similar to the premise of the book [AtlasShrugged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged) 
What happens when all the doers decide they're tired of too many people living off their work and successes and go someplace else where they won't be scrutinized because they have the motivation to work.


nice article!
"If the amount of money on deposit at banks rises they will be able to provide more loans at lower rates"

I think you may have misunderstood how banks work, they don't loan out depositors money (for the most part) they create that money out of thin air when the loan is made.

Here's a quote from the 3rd quater Bank of England Bulletin from 2007 to back that up “...by far the largest role in creating broad money is played by the banking sector... when banks make loans they create additional deposits for those that have borrowed the money.” 

And here's a quote from Paul Tucker, Deputy Governer of the Bank of England &amp; member of the Monetary Policy Committee: “Subject only but crucially to confidence in their soundness, banks extend credit by simply increasing the borrowing customer’s current account, which can be paid away to wherever the borrower wants by the bank ‘writing a cheque on itself’. That is, banks extend credit by creating money.” 

And here's a website which explains how money is created, and offers some sensible reforms: www.positivemoney.org.uk
You gotta relax bro.
Why do you say that?
I think you're referring to central banks. Private banks can't print their own money and central banks don't generally provide loans to consumers. 
I think *you* misunderstand how banks work. 
Hold on ... a conservative who is actually a real conservative, and doesn't just tow the Republican line? Now *I'm* shocked and awed. I didn't think any of you existed anymore.
Is this a joke about Bush's bad record on job creation?
If there was accountability for one's own speech, that would be reasonable. But here the anonymity pretty much destroys that ideal. 
Yes, but you can say the same thing about every other Republican candidate in the race right now. (maybe not Jon Huntsman but how's he polling?")
Yeah, BOO JOBS!!! Don't those government workers know that there is a recession happening. They should be unemployed like the rest of us!
why?
no, I'm referring to high street banks. read the info on that link I provided.
This is just what the country needs! Yay for sweeping generalisations!

Taxation itself doesn't have any stimulatory effect, its the targeted spending of that tax revenue.

If you spend tax money on something like fixing a major highway bridge, it creates new jobs or sustains current jobs and puts tax revenue back into circulation into the economy. Moreover, jobs fixing bridges and the like are tough to outsource to Indonesia as the bridge would be tough to ship.

Conversely, providing additional tax cuts to people who already have a substantial marginal reserve of cash will result in less of that money being recirculated through the economy.

Here's a [chart](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/12/06/business/06economist-bartlett/06economist-bartlett-blog480.jpg) from the CBO on exactly how much stimulus bang for your buck you get from various approaches.
Private banks can't print money you dope, that's called counterfeiting.  
And the Bank of England is a Central Bank.
FTFY.
Yes
On your last point, demand is not simply driven by consumption from US taxpayers...  I'll come back and add more later
OP, I totally agree with you. He and Paul are the only two Republicans I will vote for. If they try and run Gingrich or some other assclown, I'll write in Ronald McDonald.

I worked on the Obama campaign in 2008, and I will never vote for him again.
Sputter..Mises..stammer... Austrian School ..mumble ..parasites... burble.. sovereign individual
Two reasons: 1 Paul is an ideologue and 2 straw polls have nothing to do with democracy.
I am an Republican I approve. 
Exactly.
Hey look, it's a temporarily embarrassed millionaire!
Cable news networks and the 24/7 news cycle have been the worst thing to happen to America in decades.
Which is funny as hell to me because I remember Hannity attacking Ron Paul for a number of his policies including his refusal to involve the United States in a pre-emptive war with Iran.
Seriously. Who would vote for the only two people wanting to end nation building over seas and is serious about balancing the budgeting before the U.S. goes into a total economic collapse.  
Republicans are idiots. 
Gary Johnson was initially my first choice, but now I'm going with paul, although I would love johnson as vp
Not enough people to make them matter in a presidential race.
Maxing out retirement contributions every year may just get me there!
Because you're not one yet, the increased taxes our corrupt as fuck politicians want to push on non rich people will rob you of that. Either that or continued Wall St. implosions will ruin it. 
When rino romney takes a dump he gives birth to another huntsman.

And yes I am a conservative.

Notice I did not say Republican, even though I have voted that way since able.
Ron Paul 2012
right i agree that what you do with the tax dollars matters. What I am saying is giving tax cuts to the rich doesnt mean that the rich will be the ones to create jobs. conversely, taxing the rich more gives the government more money, but its not like the rich are going to stop hiring people just because they are taxed more. Generally, economists agree this just is not the case. 
&gt; including his refusal to involve the United States in a pre-emptive war with Iran.

He still does. They don't have to agree 100% to like each other ya?
I respect Jon Huntsman and even as a "Paultard" can concede the news media has been ignoring him even more.

No one should still be getting less coverage than Cain, who basically dropped from the race.

He's "liberal" by general republican standards, ergo the Party would rather he not get much attention.
[deleted]
"am i wrong to use critical thinking and a moral compass, to better suit the needs of myself and other americans?"

that what your question sounds like. you'd be the best to answer that.

But yeah, I'm with cbroberts, why did you even support him in the first place? because he had a catchphrase? Because you wanted to see a black republican in office?
Pretty much entirely this. 
"They?" It's on you to vote in the primaries pal. 
Good point.
One fish. Two fish. Uhh...I forgot the third.
FTFY
This is the opposite of constructive debate. Everyone is entitled to their own view, but if you're going to make claims you have to back them up with reasoned argument. Unless you don't care about constructive debate, in which case you would have no reason to trust your own beliefs, and the only reasonable course of action would be a willingness to question them.
&gt; I guess it also comes to mind that we've had large tax cuts across the board for at least the last decade and they have not shown to be stimulative on either the supply or the demand side of the economy.

The problem with this argument is that there are many more variables involved in economic prosperity than simply tax rates. And any effect of said tax cuts over the past decade (whether positive or negative) would, in the present circumstances, have been entirely overshadowed by the obscene volatility that's resulted from the banking crises.
Thread necromancy? Banking crises hit us in 2008. Bush's tax cuts began **8** years prior.  Their supposed stimulative effect could not have been overshadowed by the banking crises unless it had the ability to time travel. We had slow economic growth throughout the decade, not just at the end of it. I also encourage you to look up the proportion of this country's wealth held by the top 20% of Americans because it quickly becomes apparent that there is plenty of surplus capital for investment, regardless of tax rates. Also, have you seen the recent studies interviewing business owners about what their business response to higher tax rates would be? 
Best ever.
Constructive debate? Is that a joke? Who on the conservative/Republican side is willing to engage in constructive debate? They use economic models that exist in a vacuum to try and argue for lowering taxes on the very rich. The *only* reason to lower taxes on the rich is so that the rich pay less in taxes. Lowering their taxes even more will not create jobs. Raising their taxes by 5-10% would not kill jobs. There is no reasonable economic model that indicates lowering taxes on the very rich and corporations would have an overall negative impact on economic growth. This is a strawman that the right wing uses, because they refuse to use economic models that consider the system as a whole. Chicago school economic ideology has proven itself to be a failure, while Keynesian policies have shown time and again that they work. There is no debate.
I really like Ron Paul because he seems to be the only person who has actually read the Constitution and actually cares about upholding it. I think he actually has a decent chance of getting some attention right now because he is the presidential candidate who did not support the National Defense Authorization Act. 
But if you have a stronger middle class then you always have money moving back and forth.  I think history has shown that this "trickle-down" theory/Reagonomics thing just does not work.  Consumers run the market, if they have no money to run the market they will rely on credit, as you said.  This is the exact mindset that led us to having absolutely no middle class, even Austrian economists know that you can't have a successful economy that is reliant on debt, that's why they want to return to the gold standard.
I couldn't disagree more.  Sweden has harnessed Keynesian economics to the fullest.  Last year they had the 4th most competitive economy in the world, something the US could only dream of at this point.  They have an unbelievably low amount of social problems (ridiculously low in comparison to us), while maintaining high test scores, have a progressive tax rate, are leading the world in sustainable energy, are more accepting culturally than we are, have essentially all the civil rights we do, and have almost an entirely privatized industry.  In the last 20-30 years "Reaganomics"/"trickle-down theory" have been proven worthless, and led us to the biggest recession since the great depression.  The Bush tax cuts were a disaster, they created the slowest job creation we have seen in decades.  The GOP is currently a pro corporate, anti middle class, anti tax party (at the moment).  I'm not saying that was always true, but Fox has pushed the GOP so far right, even warping its perception of itself, that is making it destroy America in the name of "*patriotism*".

I would recommend that you do some research on how economic inequality effects societies, here is a [study](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/richard_wilkinson.html) to start you off.

If you want to argue Austrian Economics, that's fine, I have my own arguments against that.  There are plenty of flaws in there base arguments that unravel the entire thing, starting with their blatant disregard of empirical evidence/reasoning, and there founding thesis of currency being proven wrong, without retort.  They have predicted things, yes.  The Great Depression?  Yeah, they predicted it, but so did Keynes predecessor, and frankly, there are a million reasons for the Great Depression, it can't be blamed simply on "big gov", this is simple logic.  One of the reasons was actually the gold standard, which is what Ron Paul (bless his heart as he is the best GOP candidate right now, I will probably vote for him) wants to go back to, in order to eliminate the federal reserve.  His argument against the Fed is completely baseless btw, that was "fact-checked" or w/e.  In addition to these things, the Austrian mindset basically says, "shout doom and eventually it will happen," and they are right, sometimes it eventually does happen, in many cases they were left, and still are left, hanging.  A large complement to them was their recent prediction of the current recession...They were not alone in this, dozens of Keynesians predicted the same thing, using a different model, the Austrian's were not special here.

**TL;DR**:  Keynesian Macroeconomics are GREAT when used properly (it is not a strict system and is easily open to misinterpretation, i.e. Obama).  Whatever "economics" the current GOP base is using at this moment are clearly unfounded and only work to make the rich richer (as cliche as that is).  Austrian economics are debatable but have never been accurately proven, and disregard empirical evidence, and have a disproven foundation of currency, which happens to be the entire schools basis.

Additionally, everyone is corrupt (except Ron-ey Paul-ey boy and a strict couple of congressmen), SOPA, Protect IP, NDAA, Patriot Act.  Translation: Hope is lost, best shot is to vote Paul.
&gt;conservative/Republican

They like to be referred to as "job creators" now.  Lowering taxes "creates jobs".  Raising taxes "kills jobs".  Making jobs "kills jobs".  Killing jobs "makes jobs".  Get it? ;D  It's simple GOP rhetoric.  Oh, and replace words like left and progressive with socialist and communist and you are good.
It appears honest, thoughtful responses here, are getting more downvotes than upvotes.  Its probably all the Democrats/Progressives who disagree with the points.  I was thinking, maybe this thread should be in reverse order, the most downvotes go to the top!  It would be upside-down, but isn't that how things are with Republicans these days?
I'm a strong Obama supporter, but I would support a lot of the scaling back of the government if it was greatly reducing the "Defense" department.  Would you support that?  
I'm not going to lie.  No matter how much of a dink Cain was, his 9-9-9 plan was damn good.  Flat tax on everyone and getting rid of hidden taxes. 
Yeah, I agree. However, he seemed pretty dubious on whether he was going to have 9% flat for everything, or add a 9% to it. Who knows, now though?
hmm, very true,although in less than 10 years, Chinese prices, plus rising shipping costs might make onshoreing much more common.  In fact, hte only reason the USA has a shipbuilding insudtry is the Jones ACT and military purchases. I beleive South Korea is now the world's largest shuipbuilder, followed by China and Japan. For perspective, Great Britian was in the top 5 until the 1960s.
Ok, I don't remember referencing Sweden. Clearly it's easier to operate an economy comprised of 9 million well educated Northern Europeans. And I'm not a supporter of Austrian Economics or Ron Paul. There's a difference between being a supporter of facts-be-damned supply side economics, and pointing out that a country has been destroyed by unsustainable deficit levels--which is the case in Greece.
The gold standard is the worst fucking idea being floated in economics. If an economy starts to expand and more people are seeking to exchange a currency with a limited amount of supply, interest rates would have to be jacked up and any potential growth would be destroyed.
&gt; Thread necromancy?

Didn't realize this thread was so old. Was bored and browsing sub-reddits at work. Having never been to r/republicans, I clearly made the mistake of thinking that front page = new. Regardless...

&gt; Their supposed stimulative effect could not have been overshadowed by the banking crises unless it had the ability to time travel.

This is a valid point. 

And for the record, I am neither Republican nor Bush supporter (notice I said "positive **or** negative"). My intentionally-simplistic example was perhaps overly so. But I think my underlying point remains. Let me just say that I'm not an economist, but as a trained scientist (physics/engineering), it makes me twitch when I encounter arguments that seem to assume a single variable has somehow been rigorously tested in an entirely uncontrolled, ridiculously multi-variable environment. That was really my only point: I have a hard time seeing how many of the various popular doctrines of economic policy (in this case, tax policy) have *ever* been "experimentally" tested such that one could claim proof/disproof. Surely there are too many confounders/additional variables to make such claims?

To your last question. No, I haven't, but I suspect it'd be an interesting read.
yes i agree the defense department has really lost its meaning over time and has just ran its use to the ground
*shrugs* I guess we simply disagree on the possibility and importance of civil/constructive debate between political parties then. For the record, and as mentioned in my other comment (below somewhere?), I am neither Republican nor Bush supporter. But I am highly suspicious of claims that this or that economic policy has been convincingly demonstrated or proven; it just seems there are far too many variables/confounders to make such claims. 

And no, constructive debate was not a joke. I have a fair number of both conservative and liberal friends who seem entirely capable of (and interested in) engaging in such. I know intelligent people on both sides of the aisle, and think that the demonizing of the opposition that occurs on **both** sides is quite damaging to our country and national dialogue.
You skepticism about magic bullets and quick fixes and simple answers to complex economic problems is welcomed. I would say that in the area of economic growth there has been a great deal of research done and the results of that research, and of recent experience, has been the demonstration that tax cuts, especially upper income tax cuts, do not stimulate growth. In fact, the single most stimulative way the government can spend dollars is through unemployment benefits. If you want to know more, check out this link  http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3241 and feel free to skip down to the section that says "Extending High-Income Tax Cuts the Least Effective Stimulus Option"
Ah, I misread your argument then.

&gt;Demand boosting "Keynesian" policies

I thought these quotations were used to infer that Keynesianism does not work, as opposed to asserting that "Demand boosting policies" are not truly "Keynesian," or something along those lines.  My apologies for the misunderstanding and inappropriately long response :P.
I agree completely.
He honestly seems like a redeemer of the Republican party.
Perhaps you are correct, but until conservatives stop voting for Republicans, nothing will ever change, and dialogue with the right wing is an exercise in futility.

For the record, the 40s proved Keynesian economics, the 90s proved that higher taxes do not squash job growth, and take your pick of any country that took IMF/WB loans in the 90s and the austerity packages they were forced to implement to see that right wing economics does not work for anyone but those at the top. Trickle down economics does not, and never has, trickled down. 
Bachmann is a complete idiot and definitely is not going to get the nomination. I wouldn't be that concerned - Ron Paul has won a lot of straw polls also. 
I am not a Bachman supporter, but do you have any news sources for this?

Well, rather then just firing off your imagination on where your taxes go, why don't you take a [google](http://www.google.ca/) time out and research it?  According to this [source](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1258) your figure looks like $140 of your $1000 goes toward safety net programs, but with all the things your government is responsible for I would expect that.  

Perhaps you should be looking at the personal benefit you get from $200 dollars of your $1000 going toward defense? 
Out of that $140 that goes to the "program" how much of it actually reaches the target?
Very interesting. Thx for the link
I am using the internet, and you are clearly using the internet, why don't you just do what I am capable of doing for [yourself?](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2279.html)
Depending on the program it's around 10-15%.  The rest goes to overhead (bureaucrats etc).  IF I tell you that, you'll dismiss it as bias, faulty statistics etc.  If you go find it yourself, you won't doubt the figures as much.  


Probably because he is a fool and we all know it. 
There is no victor because there never was a defined enemy. We began with false pretences and ended with nothing but a large number of shattered lives and a country that will ultimately hold the last decade against us

So I'll ask you once more: Out of that $140 that goes to the "program" how much of it actually reaches the target?
http://www.wheredidmytaxdollarsgo.com
That says how much goes to the welfare program.  I'm asking how much overhead there is.  
This this this this this. One upvote was not enough.
Wrong. You're so completely ignorant it astounds me
Alright, so explain why.
I support this message
You make a claim without evidence, it isn't up to me to 'prove' what you say is true, that's your responsibility.  You act as though I have some internet research powers that are beyond yours. Perhaps my powers are beyond you and instead of actually looking up the cost of delivery for services you simply continue with your imagination that seems to oversimplify everything.
The free market and private enterprise could have provided the exact outcome you experienced.

Proper health insurance would have covered the medical condition.  Good grades (as you had) would have lead to a scholarship.  

EXAMPLE: My wife was from a family with little money and she went to a private university on Long Island, NY entirely with scholarship money.  She didn't need the Gvt. to pay for her education and she didn't take any student loans.  

Welfare promotes dependency because not everyone is responsible like you.  So many people in the USA live off the Government and make little or no contribution to society.  They are not free.  Politicians keep them dependent with social programs so they can get more votes in the next election.  It's a modern "plantation".
His biggest mistake that hurt the economy is the MASSIVE government spending he has led since taking office.  You cannot spend your way out of debt.  A fifth grader knows this.

Congress and the President BOTH need to balance the budget.  Obama wants to make the rich pay for it.  He calls it their "fair share", but that's not really fair.  If you maxed out your credit cards and then tried to force your rich neighbor down the street to pay the bill, would that be fair?  No.  They need to cut spending and star being responsible with OUR money.

Once the budget is balanced, we pay down the debt.  That will naturally lower the tax burden for everyone because we will no longer be paying Millions a day in INTEREST (daily interest as of March 2011 is $52,287,934).   That's 52 MILLION a day.  How much health care for poor people could be paid for with that kind of money?
jpstamper, What do you want the federal government to cut spending on? What do you think the government can cut and not be a political third rail? Any party that turns back any New Deal Programs will never get reelected again. 

I may be wrong, but I think that austerity measures might be bad for the economy... a cut in spending means that demand for goods a services go down and then unemployment might go up.

Some people would point  that we've built our economy on massive government spending since the Reagan years. 

I think that many people would be okay with allowing the Bush/Obama era tax cuts to roll back next year. That was the first time that there was a tax cut when we were in a war. Allowing the temporary tax cuts expire will return the revenue of the country to something sustainable... Remember, before the temporary tax cuts were made, we had a balanced budget.




Is there some confusion that the Republicans either like or support the TSA? The TSA is a union monstrosity and beloved of the Democrats. 
I already do, for all those reasons and more.

Thanks though.

We really need to find a true conservative without thirty years of baggage.  Even if we like some of what he says, Newt is a train wreck of a candidate.

Even worse is a fake conservative like Romney.  Most people already know that Romney is far from being an actual conservative.  For anyone who hasn't seen them, here are just a few of Flip-Flop Romney's positions on major issues:

Healthcare Reform - GOP claims it's horrible, but it closely resembles Romney's MA healthcare plan. - Romney FOR covering everyone before, now AGAINST it.

Abortion - Politifact checked &amp; scores the charges of flip-flop on abortion as "True"

   http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/jon-huntsman/Says-Mitt-Romney-flip-flopped-on-abortion/

Banking Bailouts - Supported Bush's $700,000,000,000 bailout of largest banks; now against bailouts

Yes I do. And yes I do.
If you were willing to vote for Herman Cain, you might just want to take a pass on voting in the future. It would be for the best.
Don't get me wrong, I like most of RP's stances on Constitutional issues, but it is a little naive to simply say "he has actually read the Constitution". If anyone actually "reads" that document, it's overly broad and more open than a 5 dollar hooker. Many socially liberal legal scholars (and justices) argue that the Constitution is in fact a living document, therefore interpretation in light of "evolving community standards" is a must. Again, I like how RP uses the Constitution for his arguments/stances, but it is overly simplistic to assert that a "strict" or "textualist" interpretation is the only true or genuine way of going about things....
I was obviously facetious when saying 'actually read.' although I agree to an extent that the Constitution is a living document, I think it is more important to be more literal about it then almost all the politicians are today. Loose interpretations result in careless laws which don't work in the long term. I agree that Paul is extremist and I don't agree with him in all things, I prefer him because I trust him to uphold the Constitution the best and he will not support acts like NDAA even if he is extreme. 
reporting in, i see you posted 1 month ago..... i know, number of sane, actual conservatives (not neocons) is dwindling
4 months old but ill give it a shot in light of recent events. He is just another neo-con (which real republicans hate, like me), he managed to keep the war on drugs and terror alive and well. Not to mention signed NDAA and will not veto SOPA. He is Bush #2, but the left loves him because he is one of them. Political parties take care of their own, even if they fuck up big time
We arent neo-cons, we hate the TSA
You know what? I am a bleeding heart liberal, but I could be a Nixon republican. I mean, that guy was for the EQual rights amendment, and he created the EPA. Nixon is currently sitting left of Clinton, and probably left of Obama. (I feel a lot of what Obama has done is constrained by his republician congress) I have horrible things to say about Nixon... But I like his policies. 

Oh and, Obama would be bush #3 lol, there've been already two bushes! 
Dems had control in both houses and the presidency in 2009, and they did nothing. Dont blame the republicans on that one.
First, you do realize that the democratitc party is a big tent, right? That just because there were 58 dems in the senate, didn't mean that they all were one voting block. 

Second, generally in the political process it is possible to build consensus from both parties... The republicians DID work as a voting block. As a party of no, and rejecting everything that the democrats did; they were able to peel off a few DINOs in the senate and block tons of things. 

Third, the democrats never did hold a fillibuter proof majority in the senate, as I said, they only ever held 58 seats. There was (is?) two non democrats in the senate. The way that the senate works currently, one needs 60 seats to do anything , otherwise the bill gets filibustered. (once again, the republicans are a giant party of no). So just because the two third partiers in the senate chose to caucus with the dems on occasion, they were still their own thing. 

So what it boils down too is that Obama wanted to do great things for the benefit of the American people, yet he was hamstrung by the republicans and the right of center democrats in office. 
I'm curious though... Who do you like that the republicans are running for president now. The current crop looks like a bunch of Neo-cons and flip-floppers to me. 

I'd say that John huntsman is the most sane of them. Gary Johnson was also my governor for a while. He's a pretty straight shooter. Too. 
republicans do vote as a block and that is their strong point, dems dont, which hinders them all the time. If the dems could unite they could do what they wanted by maybe swaying some of the GOP to pass a bill. Obama is just as bad as Bush, he signed NDAA and actually wanted more power over the american people. Also, he gets more money from wall street than all of the GOP combined. President? more like Emperor.  

Source: http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-has-more-cash-from-financial-sector-than-gop-hopefuls-combined-data-show/2011/10/18/gIQAX4rAyL_story.html
John Huntsman was my favorite too in the beginning, but he has no chance. I opted to support Ron Paul because he is honest and I simply hate all the others. His financial policy is horrid beyond belief, but they would never get passed, so its not a problem if he got elected. 
So you're going to plug your nose and vote for ron paul, but hope he doesnt get elected. 

What a horrid state of american politics.. 
yes sir
Does anyone know how many presidents were an affront to the banks but didn't get assassinated? 
Yes, why does the Left think that those of us on the right like the TSA? We have no love for the lines at the airport and we know it's all security theatre for the masses.
Alternate title for this submission - "GOP remembers that they hate Newt Gingrich!"
I am a Republican who has no grudge against Cantor, but in general, the love my side has for Reagan is a bit silly.

Reagan was a master political operator. He made deals with Tip O'Neill all the time to get things done in Congress. Reagan was not the uber-arch-conservative that some on my side remember him as. 
lol typical military person
In another week, we'll figure out how he is really doing.  If he puts on a good showing in NH, he'll be part of the discussion.  He skipped Iowa and that was where all of the media was, so no one was really around to talk about him.  Hopefully the short time between Iowa and New Hampshire doesn't kill him.  I think it would be great to watch him matter during the campaign.
"Clearly it's easier to operate an economy comprised of 9 million well educated Northern Europeans"

If this was the case, the world would be dominated by the smallest populations everywhere, which is laughably incorrect.

Their economic strength has nothing to do with their small size relative to ours.  It has to do with the way they set their laws. They grow as a society...rich and poor together.  

The United States came to power through this exact strategy.  A healthy, growing middle class is the base of a great economy.  Ever since the "trickle down" theory was implemented, we have suffered from growing economic imbalance and a rich class that is strangling the middle class. This is why we now have a poor economy.


In these 2 scenarios, which do you think would be better for the economy.


1. The wealth is spread out fairly evenly.  There are of course some rich and some poor, but the general feel is that everyone has enough, plus a little to splurge and save.  Most people will purchase the necessities...food, toiletries, gas, a car, a house...etc.  The rich will also have these things, but will of course have their private jets, lamborghinis, and other extravagant things.

2.  The rich (a handful of people for our argument) hold 90% of the wealth and the rest of us are forced to split up the 10%.  The rich will buy the toiletries they need, food, a house or 5, lamborghinis, etc.  The rest of us can barely make it by.  We have to scrounge every month and hope we have enough to pay our mortgage, food and gas to get to work.  

You see, the rich dont simply buy more things because they have more money.  I mean, are you ever going to buy more toilet paper than you need, another toothbrush just cus you have another $5 to spend?  No, you wont.  Demand isnt created by making a few people richer while sucking it out of the rest of the population.  Demand is and has always been created by the middle class.

Why do you think China is doing so well, because they have loosened economic freedoms on their population.  They are growing the paychecks their middle class exponentially.  This causes everyone to benefit.  

A rising tide will lift all boats indeed.  The problem is that the rich arent rising the tide, they are a cement block drowning us all.  The middle class can rise the tide.  It just needs a government that is out for its best interest, not the rich.
Beloved by dems? The TSA was sponsored by one dem and one repub. Passed by a repub house and split senate. Then signed by George Bush. 
The idea is that new markets will be created through business investment in new ideas and technologies. The "not buy more toilet paper" argument doesn't work because it assumes that all people spend their money on is basic consumer goods.    
    
Say someone decides to paint their house a new color or build an addition. This money will flow to painters and contractors. If someone has an increase in wealth they might decide to buy a new care or boat, which benefits not only the immediate sellers, but also the factory workers and the people who provide raw goods for the manufacturing process.    
    
Not exactly sure how the government exactly "looks after" the middle class. They could slightly increase taxes on the wealthy to pay for a middle class tax cut I guess. Strengthening union laws really only benefits the people who already have those jobs, but does nothing to help the unemployed. Forcing heavy manufacturing to come back to the U.S. would ignite a global trade war, and we've already seen how federally mandated investments in thins like "green energy" works out.    
    
China's also in a giant bubble by the way, and the only reason it hasn't popped and they've continued to grow is because the people have no rights and can't decided that they may not be interested in working for 50 cents and hour making shoes in an 80 hour work week.   
    
Edit: Downvote for unnecessary pretentiousness.
People don't start or invest in a business because there is an excess of money.  They start a business because there is demand for a product.  The middle class is where 99% of demand comes from.

Just stand back and look at the big picture.  Is it possible that rich people have created this way to make poor people think that by keeping more money in the hands of the rich, it will benefit the poor?  Of course it is possible.

My point is that having a large middle class will make more people paint houses, buy a car, or buy a boat.  Are you really telling me that someone with a $100 million doesnt already have every car that they want?  If they receive another $100 million, you really think they will use that to buy more cars?  Not a chance.  But if we spread that $100million over a bunch of middle-class people, I bet we would sell A LOT more cars.

Yes, currently, the tax code favors the wealthy by A LOT.  The mega-wealthy pay a fraction of what they earn.  And the argument that 1/2 of americans dont pay taxes is complete BS.  Everyone pays medicare, social security, sales tax...the list goes on and on.  I worked at McDonalds in highschool.  I remember seeing those taxes go from each paycheck.  What they really mean is that a large portion of the poorest americans do not pay income taxes.  Thats because we have squeezed the middle class so hard, that there is a VERY large portion of people who make under $30K per year.  You really think these people can afford to pay ANY income tax?  They barely have enough to survive.

All this while Multi-billion earners on wallstreet pay 15% on their income.  Just ask Warren Buffett.  He knows the game.  He pays a lower percent of his money to taxes than his secretary that makes $60K.  Google it if you dont believe me.

Anyone who doesnt think investing in green energy is in OUR best interest either has their head in the sand or is standing to make a profit in lieu of green energy.  Oil companies hate green energy for obvious reasons.  The fact is that oil is going to run out someday.  Letting China be the technological leader in this area is a very short-sighted view, and will hurt America more than maybe anything else in the next generation.  The day isnt far off that green energy will be cheaper than oil.  What exactly is your issue with invvesting money in a longterm growth strategy?  That seems very capitalist to me (as do you).

Your assertion of FACT that China is in a bubble doesnt seem to parallel with other economist who nearly unanimously agree that China will be a very significant economic competitor/partner for years to come.  Chinese citizens are not slaves.  They may not enjoy all of the personal freedoms we think we do, but many of them are very happy.  Its not as bad as you seem to think for the majority of Chinese citizens either.  They have gone from a third world country to modern civilization in only about 15 years.


A lack of facts often leads to claims of pretentiousness.
TL;DR

Trickle Down has been a proven, consistent failure.

Yes, I would raise taxes on the rich..fairly significantly.  Also, I would go back to tax codes that favor the companies that reinvest their money rather than take it out and put it in personal banking accounts.

Most of those policies were put in by a combination of republicans and democrats. Stop thinking your precious retarded republicans aren't the issue, and realize that all of the politicians are bought and sold by the wall street cartel. 
Businesses won't invest immediately in new things; for example, look at tech companies like Apple. They have tech far beyond what they sell, but they milk everything they can out of current tech for as high of a price as they can. Competition is removed from the market ever so increasingly. This idea that companies are investing in anything solid is in fact not solid itself. 
We need a currency backed on a basket of needed commodities, like food products and timber. Real things, things that show how strong a nation is at its heart. 
However, they do sometimes create loans from money they don't have on the bet that they will get that money back someday. 
In the form of principle + interest. It's impossible for a bank to loan out money that it doesn't have.
No being an asshole often leads to claims of pretentiousness. 99% of demand comes from the middle class? This is entirely made up. And it's not just people with hundreds of millions and billions v. the middle class. There is an entire professional class of hard workers who've earned their money and shouldn't pay 40 percent of their income in taxes. This is a point OWS missed entirely. The 15 percent rate on buffet isn't income tax either, it's the tax rate on carried interest. And there will be a time when green energy is more competitive, when oil becomes too expensive and businesses develop new technologies and switch to alternatives like nat gas, increased fuel efficiency tech, and eventually solar/wind when it becomes profitable. Obama's green jobs plan was bullshit, remember Solyndra? And economists nearly unanimously agree on China's future significance? True, but just because the US had a real estate bubble that popped doesn't mean it will forever be economically irrelevant.   
   
How do you like those facts?
Where have you been? It's called fractional reserve lending.

It seems to me like you are getting angry and resorting to personal attacks.  This often happens when your opinions are met with facts that you dont undersstand, but you cannot explain.  That is ok, I understand it is hard to accept that things you believe so strongly in have been turned upside down.

Let me debunk some more of your "facts."  Although, I think you need to look up the definition of fact in the dictionary.

Yes, demand comes from the middle class.  I consider the professional class the middle class. The only way we can agree/disagree is if you were to start assigning numbers to your categories.  To me, the problem isnt with the business professionals (people who make around 0.5-10 million).  In fact, a LARGE majority of these individuals support raising taxes on the wealthy (themselves).  My problem is with the mega-wealthy ($100million+), but not even all of them.  The ones who use the wealth that they have accumulated to buy favors from congress.  Lobbying is one way, Super PACS is another.  People like the Koch Brothers.

You say that you doubt that 99% of demand comes from the middle class.  In my mind, I call the middle class people that make roughly 500K per year and under.  From my research, it seems that less than 3% of households make over $200,000 per year.  So I would say my number is fairly accurate.

Why do you seem to think that people "who have earned their money" (as if someone who makes on 50K per year doesnt earn their money) shouldnt pay 40%.  Do you realize how low a 40% tax is?  Capiltal gains were 90% in the 1980s.  now they are 15%.  40% compared to the rest of the industrialized world is such a low number that its funny.  Noone got to where they were without help from others in America.  Noone has an inherent right to keep all of their money at a detriment to others.

OWS missed nothing.  They are informed.  Something you are not.  You are highly misinformed.  I can tell, it is probably because you watch FauxNews too much.  How can I tell?  Because you reference Solyndra.  Lets get real.  Find a real argument of substance.

I never said Buffet's taxes were at 15%.  And you are misinformed again... His effective tax rate (the tax he paid on every dollar he earned), was 16-17 percent. 

So youa re saying that green energy is the obvious future, but Obama was stupid for investing in research for this exact thing?  Hmmm...that doesnt seem to make sense.  You need to make a point, not just "remember Solydra."  Most people dont know anything about it, because we dont pray to Bill Oreilly every night.

You said, "And economists nearly unanimously agree on China's future significance? True, but just because the US had a real estate bubble that popped doesn't mean it will forever be economically irrelevant."  

I dont even know how to make sense of this.  I cant see any real point in that entire thought.  Its like you were trying to argue against my point, figured out you couldnt, so you rambled on, not making any sense.

You didnt have any facts in your rebuttle.  You had opinions, never constructfully supported by arguments. But the few facts you attempted to incorporate were skewed.

Sorry. The truth can be hard to accept.
Its because they are looking for the exact opposite of Obama and as it turns out, all the people that have run in the recent elections are the exact damn same. Republicans and Democrats are no different. They just what you to think they are. That is why we need a credible third party.


Most of it is partisanship.

So long as we operate within the artificial division of Dem/Rep this will be the case.
What are you talking about? The candidates are nothing like Obama.

I think that I soured on him when he started talking about global warming. He can't seem to understand the difference between an honest skepticism of the science, and being "anti-science". I think it's OK that he has a different view on the issue than I do, but I resented how dismissive he was about it.

After that, I found that there were plenty of other candidates available to hold my interest, so there was really no use for him.
What do you think we can do differently? Have a strong 3rd party? I think the two party system is the natural evolution of American politics. Based on the first past the post system and no history of Westminster style parliament.  

I think the best way to change the two party system is to institute an instant runoff election in the ballot. 
The smart vote is leaning a bit more towards ron paul I think, it might have been huntsman but the whole war with Iran thing and overspending isnt appealing.
This is the way we *want* things to be.
If you worked while getting your cancer treatment and PhD, then your subject line is false.  You paid taxes, which in turn paid for those treatments and PhD.  The problem with wellfare systems is that people become entitled and believe that they deserve the money of other people.  An economy is best served if taxes are low and people are self-sufficient and independent.  Look at Greece, this is the end of the road for ALL wellfare systems; maybe not today or tomorrow, but in the near future.
Utahn here. Regarding the whole climate change debate policy shift from Huntsman...
Reminds me too much of Maslow's heirarchy of needs. There is no sense in worrying too much about the environment when you can't even put food in your belly. Not saying Huntsman is poor but lets face it, this nation's core is totally broken: millions are without jobs and millions are homeless resulting from the recession. Lets fix our economics before getting back into cap-and-trade.
He's the smartest one of the bunch. I hope to see him in '16
I have been a Utah resident for 10 years, part of it under Huntsman.

GREAT GUY.

He is Mormon Republican, but understands that he must represent all demographics in the State, not just other Mormon Republicans.

He lived in China. He speaks the language and knows the culture. He understands what it takes to reach across cultural barriers.

His family is rich, but very philanthropic. Reference Huntsman Cancer Institute.

Mitt Romney is very bland. I presict he would be an inconsequential president.

I would predict that Jon Huntsman would be an engaging president, domestically and internationally.
&gt; He can't seem to understand the difference between an honest skepticism of the science, and being "anti-science".

The Republican view on global warming is that it doesn't exist. That's not honest skepticism, that's anti-science. Skepticism would be looking at the facts, disagreeing with the hypothesis, and then proposing a new hypothesis using the same data. This isn't a matter of opinion. This is a matter of science versus ignoring data. 

He's too centrist, and in these days of far-left or far-right primary pandering, he doesn't appeal to the crowd.
False.

Climate science is insanely complicated, and I won't speak for all Republicans, but I don't think that I'm remotely competent to pass judgement on the veracity of the theory.

Like 99.99% of people who have an opinion on the issue (on BOTH sides) I have to rely on the trustworthiness and competence of the scientists who are doing the research. But when I look at them, I see a cult of personality, a self admiration society, and a cadre of leftist activists. I cannot place my trust in them that they are impartially looking at the issue, and basing their judgement solely on the "science".

When cosmologists tell me that the solar system was created billions of years ago by the slow accumulation of cosmic particles, I don't see that they have any reason to lie to me. I accept that they have reached their conclusions using verifiable scientific processes, even if I don't fully understand them. 

But when I see things like "climate scientists" being arrested protesting the construction of an oil pipeline, I'm justified in thinking that climate change is a "cause" for them.  If they need to fudge the numbers, or outright lie, to advance their cause then I believe that they will do so.

I don't say that I irrationally reject the theory of anthropogenic climate change out of hand. I just say that I am healthily skeptical.
He seems to be too liberal to appease many of the uber-conservative group that votes primarily in the caucuses and primaries. Not to mention He doesn't seem to have much appeal to the conservative core of the party and the Tea Partiers that many conservative republicans associate themselves with.
I dont believe welfare is bad, I just believe it needs more moderation other than just throwing away money to people. (Drug tests, debt moderation, etc.)
That doesn't change his argument though that the majority of republicans really don't look at any facts, or use any reason at all and just say it doesn't exist because they don't want to: That's anti-science.

Climate science is insanely complicated, but when the UN's, the US's, and when independent climate scientists funded by groups like the Heritage Foundation and other right-wing organizations all find the same exact things, it's hard to just outright dismiss it because it's "wrong" without being anti-science. As the guy said above, proposing your own hypothesis based on data ("it could be because of volcanoes or the data could be misread or fudged a bit to make it look worse") isn't anti-science because you're looking at reasons *why* it could be the way you think, instead of just outright dismissing years of work because Fox News said so.
&gt;That doesn't change his argument though that the majority of republicans really don't look at any facts, or use any reason at all and just say it doesn't exist because they don't want to: That's anti-science.

Just because you declare this to be true, doesn't make it true. In fact I could just as easily say that the Democrats don't look at the facts. They just cherry-pick scientific theories that happen to be in line with their political philosophy. If they find science that they don't agree with, they simply declare that is isn't "productive" to study those areas of science.

For example, liberal academics *literally* "got the vapors" when [The Bell Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve) came out and offended their delicate sensibilities. 
I never said Democrats don't cherry pick and therefore aren't anti-science, and it wouldn't offend me if someone did.

Maybe I should have said instead of republicans in general, I should have said republican candidates (which is who Huntsman was addressing more or less) - who have (through many interviews, etc) outright denied it on the basis of "nuh uh."
I think that I can get on board with that. It definitely has a ring of truth to it.

Honestly though, if we are just talking about the candidates, I don't think that any of them are either pro or anti science. They are making up their mind almost entirely on poll results. 
You say look at greece, and yet Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and most of Europe implements a "welfare" or socialist system in one form or another and they are more solvent than the U.S. in a lot of cases. In fact, if we continue down the path we are going, some would argue that most european countries will be better off in the future than the United States.
[deleted]
Before you make a claim that Europe will be more solvent than the US in the future, please point to where you can even begin to believe such a thought.  Please please back up what you're saying with some sort of PROFESSIONAL CREDIBLE economic data that points that this will be the case.  
You point to Greece as though it is evidence of all welfare systems eventually failing, yet those countries are currently doing better than the United States - Both in terms of debt as % of GDP and deficit in terms of GDP.
ROFLOL!  You still haven't provided proof to back up your statement that the European countries would be more solvent than the United States in the future...so I'm still waiting for you to provide some solid proof of that.  Or are you just evading something that you know you said that is patently false? Hmmm....
I'm waiting for you to prove that Greece is an example of where all socialist countries will end up (by the way, a lot of the US is socialized). Or are you evading something that you know you said is patently false? hmm...
Disband the party system or add another party
lol now i know for a fact you don't know what you are talking about.  The burden of proof is on you because you made an outlandish comment.  What you TRIED to just do is 100% typical of people who know their platform is weak.
The burden of proof that Greece is indicative of all socialist countries is on you. Once you do this, then the burden of proof is on me to prove that other socialist countries are better off than the U.S.

&gt; cadre of leftist activists

You hear the same thing coming from pro-intelligent design camps.  If you are a proponent of evolution, you are a "leftist activist."  Just because something doesnt fit your world view doesnt mean that you are allowed to be ignorant of it.  Climate science, evolution, and anything about space are all perfectly learnable.

&gt; When cosmologists tell me that the solar system was created billions of years ago by the slow accumulation of cosmic particles, I don't see that they have any reason to lie to me

But for other people whose paradigm this type of science spits in the face of, they MAKE UP reasons why these scientists would lie to them.  IE, "the universe is 6000 years old and god created it in 7 days, these atheist scientists are lying to deceive us."  Or in the case of creationists, "The scientists are lying/misguided about those dinosaur bones.  The devil put them there to deceive us."

In the case of global warming, there are plenty of businesses that have an interest (and the money) to spread misinformation like this, all in the name of greed and ignorance.

Science, on the other hand, does not have an agenda.  
&gt;If you are a proponent of evolution, you are a "leftist activist."

I can't speak for everyone, but that is not what I'm saying at all. They aren't "leftist activists" because they hold a particular viewpoint. They are *actual* environmental activists. They go to protests, donate money to causes, chain themselves to trees, and are just generally part of the movement. 

&gt;But for other people whose paradigm this type of science spits in the face of, they MAKE UP reasons why these scientists would lie to them.

Or in the case of creationists, "The scientists are lying/misguided about those dinosaur bones. The devil put them there to deceive us."

This is one of those things that does embarrass me a little, because you are correct that there are actually people who do this. But is is a logical fallacy to conclude that the behavior of one set of people can be used as a rule to undermine the validity of other people on completely different issues. 

&gt;Science, on the other hand, does not have an agenda. 

As you can tell from the rest of my post, the problem is that scientists can have an agenda. The scientists aren't just saying "X is happening, and here's why". What they are saying is "X is happening, and you must now do A, B, and C to save yourselves". And it just so happens (by the purest coincidence, I'm sure) that A, B, and C are all leftist talking points. 
Lol, 500 words later I read something about rambling on. That's about it. Maybe when you get out of your college bubble where mommy and daddy finance your entire lifestyle you will get some real perspective. Or just be unemployed and complain about rich people.
I think as a party, we need to just go back to candidates acting more like normal people.  I've never seen such a sorry bunch of wack jobs and losers as this time around.

It might be a surprise, but the biggest thing we need to change is that many of our candidates want to slash social security that our own base has been paying into for up to 40 years or more.  Many have paid in for say 10 to 40 years too, and wouldnt' want to see their social security disappear or get destroyed, or have their elderly parents get a big cutback either.

What the heck has happened to decent and reasonable people like Gerald Ford and Gov. Nelson Rockerfeller???  The current crop of Republicans (except maybe Huntsman, and he's a traitor) are so wakko conservative and idiotic, they're handing the election to Obama.
It's not just Perry who is an embarrasment...  by far.  I think as a party, we need to just go back to candidates acting more like normal people.  I've never seen such a sorry bunch of wack jobs and losers as this time around.

Ron Paul 
Poor math dominates Iowa cacus, helping the GOP lie to everyone.
Mounting Mitt Romney.
I make up my own news. It is in direct contradiction with all news sources.
I Do.

Upvote for truth
Newt is a douchenozzle
I disagree. I voted for Obama, Now Ron Paul has my support. I can flip flop all I want, and if this is the only way to restore sanity to our country then so be it. Traipsing from the far end of one wing to the other.
No, vote Ron Paul, something good might happen.
Divided we fall..
Rick Perry is a liability to your post.
All while defrauding the Iowa caucus. Where do they find the time?
Ok, but after independent review it was found that no data had been manipulated for personal or institutional gains. I can understand being "healthily skeptical" as you put it but there's a line between that and buying into conspiracy theories.

Except for Mitt Romney, he just plain can't make up his mind on anything.
X is happening and here's Y! Anyway, the great thing about the scientific community is that ALL research has to be independently peer reviewed. It is a competitive field and most scientists are willing to take an unbiased view and shoot down a hypothesis of even their closest friends in the name of science.
I got RON PAUL.
After Obama.
And Jon Huntsman.
Fuck.

I want a guy who's a big enough douchenozzle to call for the arrest of judges he disagrees with!

I want a guy who earned about $33,000 PER HOUR doing God knows what at Fannie Mae just before it collapsed and had to get a Bush bailout.

I want a guy who's on his third wife but championed "family values" for many years, and who left his first wife while she was dying of cancer, and told her while she lay in her hospital bed!

We need more assholes like Newt. He makes the Democrat party look a bit better than the spineless toads that most of them are.

Newt is the best amphibian ever... (for helping to get more Democrats elected.)

I don't think it's helpful to the GOP to give this flip-flopping phony any free publicity.

"Doing well" would be, for example, having a home and $200,000 in assets.

Doing extremely very well (that also probably means you're crooked in one way or another) would be roughly $2,000.000 in total assets.

Doing very well might be $20,000.000.

Romney has about $150,000,000 to $250,000,000 dollars in assets, with much of it parked conveniently in the Cayman Islands.

Having a front-runner with this kind of over-the-top mega-wealth doesn't sit well with a lot of people, even many Republicans.

Defend it if you want, but it doesn't help the GOP at all.
A person's wealth shouldn't mean shit to anyone. If they can get the job done, they should be elected. Plain and simple.
You forgot the Christian element. Regardless of how constitution says no religious tests and the whole separation thing, Ron Paul has no problem enforcing Christianity even if it's a waste of tax payers dollars 
Can you give an example of this? The only thing I can think of that you might have in mind is his position on abortion, which is in line with his religion, but legally defended only on the scientific concept that human life begins at conception. If this position is correct, then abortion = killing, which is already illegal.

I can't think of any time when Ron Paul has advocated or voted for a legal prohibition on an act that he views as immoral (e.g. drug abuse, homosexuality, gay marriage, etc.) but *does not* view as a violation of individual liberty. Please prove me wrong, because I really would love to know if you are correct.

Huh. I supported Huntsman from the beginning, but apparently I'm a Romney guy, with Huntsman in second. 
What a shame you were unable to refute even a single point.

You're a troll for one and for two your points are blatantly retarded. Go fuck yourself.

I don't care if republicans think he is electable or will win. I will be voting for Ron Paul out of principle.

Medicare has been paid into by the people who once paid into it themselves. Granted, there are people who are on Medicare who never paid into that system (depending on when they were employed), and there are people who paid into Medicare but don't collect benefits (for a variety of reasons).

"Nanny states" are actually where the government holds your hand throughout your life, treating you as though you were perpetually four years old. However, *entitlement* states, where the government basically gives money to people who did nothing to earn it. Granted, as I noted above, there are similar cases under Medicare, but I have a feeling these make up for a small percentage of cases. Furthermore, in an entitlement state, healthcare is subsidized by all taxes; Medicare, if I'm not mistaken, is largely self-funded (the key word there is largely -- they're not without help from the rest of the federal budget). This helps to ensure that the system benefits those who have helped the system, as opposed to some weird Occupy Healthcare plan you'd find in Europe.
&gt;some weird Occupy Healthcare plan you'd find in Europe.

The healthcare plans that are better than ours and keep their citizens in better health you mean?
No, I mean the ones where people who do not do anything to earn anything are given whatever they want. Also known as [this](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freeloading).
Yeah the ones were you have to wait years for a life-saving operation.  Whereas in the US you can get even selective surgery in a manner of days.
I guess I wasn't think about "nanny state" properly.

It brings up another question for me, though. Why do Republicans like a government run healthcare option for those aged 65 and over, but not for those under 65?
How exactly is "human life begins at conception" a scientific concept?
... and then you die from stress-related maladies, bankrupt and your spirit broken.
Because old people vote more than anyone else
And then you go to another thread.
&gt; Why do Republicans like a government run healthcare option for those aged 65 and over, but not for those under 65?

Simple answer really - the retirement age.
We already do.
&gt;Romney has about $150,000,000 to $250,000,000 dollars in assets, with much of it parked conveniently in the Cayman Islands.

"Much of it" being the 15 million out of his 250 million total assets? Also you left out the fact that he still pays taxes on those offshore funds.

&gt;Doing extremely very well (that also probably means you're crooked in one way or another)

*Sigh*
If you have insurance and you aren't a freeloader.
This is what blows my mind about America. You'd rather *everyone* gets ripped off by insurance companies, just to spite the 10% who don't have a job? 

Not trying to be a douche. I just really don't get it. For such a fundamentally Christian country, it's surprising you'd do the exact opposite of Jesus' teachings. 
lol.

This doesn't sound made up at all ;)
Jesus taught two things: help those in need, and help people get on their own two feet.  He did not ever say "give people what they want" or "help those who can help themselves, just because they can't afford something."  He also never taught that it was okay to lift up one person by taking money out of the pocket of another, which is what socialized medicine must do to pay for itself (nothing is free, after all).

Between Medicaid and Medicare, our government (via the taxpayers) already helps provide medical services to two groups who may have trouble paying for it alone (the disadvantaged and the retired).  What makes working age folks suddenly "in need" that my taxes should also help pay medical costs for them?  I can't afford my own health insurance, but I don't expect Uncle Sam to give it to me just because I don't have it.
Doesn't "help those in need" also mean you shouldn't bankrupt someone who breaks a bone? 

&gt;  I can't afford my own health insurance

This is why opponents of nationalised health care all sound a tad on the simple side to me, with the greatest of respect. You can't afford to take care of yourself, and neither can many millions of others, both employed and unemployed. But you refuse to allow government to cut the cost, literally *for everyone* in the country. 

In Britain, I never personally pay for a prescription. Going to a doctor is a matter of making an appointment if I want a check up, or if I'm ill I can make an emergency appointment and get seen by my local GP that day. If I have an accident (say I fall off a ladder and break my leg), I get taken by ambulance to my nearest hospital three miles away, and get seen immediately. Money isn't an issue. Ever. I know my family are covered, I know my friends are covered, I know I am covered. 

I honestly don't see any downsides to a health care system like ours. Whereas the problems that dominate American health care are exacerbated by immoral insurance companies that deny care  if they see a chance to make money. It's fucking sickening.
I'm not saying every insurance company out there is staffed entirely by saints, but are you honestly one of those people who believe that corporations, capitalism, et. al. are pure evil?

It's not necessarily that they're just sitting there stuffing their faces with money -- you do realize businesses need to MAKE money in order to have money to SPEND, right? That goes for the government as well -- as blackargonaut pointed out above, nothing is free. You just happen to pay for your healthcare via exorbitant taxes, whereas I pay for mine through exorbitant insurance.
&gt; are you honestly one of those people who believe that corporations, capitalism, et. al. are pure evil?

Not at all. I *do* think that denying people healthcare/bankrupting people who need healthcare *is* pure evil. I'd ask you to take a good look at yourself if you disagree with me on that. 

I wouldn't call our taxes "exorbitant". We pay a lot of tax, sure, but I'm happy to pay it for what we get. For a start we get all facets of healthcare paid for through taxation, so no one will ever be forced to suck a dick because they got cancer in this country. We get an excessively big military. We get fairly decent police, and a well trained and prompt fire service. 

We get shitloads for our taxes, and I think the difference between our countries is that over here political discourse hasn't been poisoned by disingenuous lies by extremists on both sides of the aisle. We can actually talk about problems fairly rationally in my country. It's not always left vs right. Sanity tends to prevail over insanity in my country, and I'm sorry to say the same can't be said of your leaders.
Don't worry, I don't believe that people who need healthcare should have it denied to them. And I certainly agree with you when you say that extremists on either sides of the aisle in my country are probably some of the most crooked, hate-driven people out there.
That said, I think the main point on which we disagree is not necessarily the ends, but the means.
I had Paul, then Santorum. But I would definitely prefer those be switched.

In any case, an interesting tool.
Once conception occurs, the new organism has a unique and independent DNA sequence and [is fundamentally its own being](http://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/embryoquotes2.html). It is not just another cell of the parent anymore, although it does still require constant sustenance from the parent (this is true for some time after birth as well though).

Any other definition of the beginning of life seems to involve some cognitive dissonance when considering underdeveloped/retarded/handicapped people, or else an inherent argument for euthanasia on some level. How would you define life, scientifically?
Not at all, heard plenty of examples out of Canada and UK of people having to wait months for a critical operation.

On the other hand, when I needed to have a selective surgery, I was offered any time starting with the next day.
I'd like to see those examples. I've never heard of anyone having to wait for critical surgery. I've heard of people having to wait for non-lifesaving surgery, which is fair enough. How much did your selective surgery cost, do you mind me asking? 

Again, say what you like about the NHS. At least we'll never leave someone to die because they don't have money, nor will we ever try to take two thousand dollars off someone for an ambulance ride. It'd be funny if it weren't so fucking tragic. I sincerely hope you don't get ill.
Zygotes and blastocysts are not the same as a person. You talk about the illegality of killing, but that only applies to persons.
Seniors in Florida disappointed that candidates say little about Social ...: At the Senior Friendship Center, a bustling hub tucked amid palm fronds and azaleas where elders gather to socialize, exercise, and seek medical care, political banter is interwoven with gentle ribbing and flagrant flirting.

When talk turned to Medicare and Social Security in the days leading up to tomorrow’s Florida Republican primary, this critical voting bloc voiced disappointment that the issues disproportionately affecting seniors have been notably absent from debates and candidates’ stump speeches here. Most older voters say they don’t know what distinguishes the GOP contenders from each other when it comes to the future of the two programs. “I think the candidates want to stay away from it, keep it quiet until after the primaries,’’ Damn straight, they are hoping seniors do not realize Republicans plan on cutting them to save their future. They better wake up!

Republicans are the biggest threat to our version of America which is right for the masses thus America's biggest enemies!

My selective surgery.  It was years ago, but I think including the costs of the preparatory visits/bloodwork/ultrasounds/post-operative checkups/etc it was a few hundred dollars.

And here in the US we won't let you die because you don't have money either.  It's actually against the law.  NHS won't let you die because you don't have money, they'll just let you die because they don't have room for you.
Here is the scenario that this article does not consider. Romney or Newt is the GOP nominee. Campaign ads go negative to the extreme. Indie voters fail to turn out along with scores of Republicans that weren't initially enthusiastic and continue to become disillusioned with a candidate that either is a MA liberal or got kicked out of office. Obama field drives turnout with their superior GOTV operation, no GOP counterpart has existed since '04. Obama wins and with the coordination of other House and Senate races a good many of them change hands too.
6 months doesn't sound that bad. The median wait time in the US is about 4.5 months.

But heart transplants isn't  a good measurement of healthcare delivery. It's influenced by the availability of hearts more than anything else.

NHS doesn't rank well among other state run health care systems. But it's fair to say that people have been denied life-saving treatments in the US, particularly with HMO's.
Whats funny is how ignorant people are.  I actually would consider myself fairly well off.  Maybe I'm not Mitt Romney - rich but I am perfectly fine.

In fact, the odds are I have more money than you.

My opinions arent created from personal need.  My opinions are created from objectively viewing what is wrong with this country and our politcal system. Sorry buddy.

I like how you dont try rebut any of my FACTS because you cant.  Lose again.  Often, people revert to personal attacks when the things the believe are turned completely upside down.  I knows its hard to imagine you have been wrong, but just be objective. 
It's stories like this that make me wonder if the goal is to stay neck-and-neck until the convention. While I'm no political heavyweight myself, isn't getting rid of someone when others notice that he's the reason for recent improvements... counter-indicated? Is this going to lead to Newt having a better debate day without this gentleman working for Romney?
So middle income has stagnate (while inflation has actually caused wages to go down) since Reagan. 

Seems like the middle class is sinking in your rising tide analogy. 

Well they haven't stagnated exactly, if you look at the CBO report (I don't have the link) I believe real wages for the middle class have risen, just at a much slower pace than the upper levels.    
    
But I think a lot of that has to do with factors other than tax policy, like the loss of union jobs that has occurred mostly due to industry leaving the US rather than tax policy, although lower taxes for the rich is definitely a reason they've become wealthier.    
    
Unless the stagnant middle class wages are a result of decreased levels of government transfers from a loss of tax revenue, I don't think that tax policy should take all, or even most of the blame. I think there was another study which showed that rising health care costs (not necessarily because people are less healthy but because there are also better, but more expensive care options) have absorbed what would otherwise have been a greater increase in wages alone.    
    
Regardless, I think that aggregate demand from a strong middle class is more important for growth today than any supply side solutions. If we were talking about dropping rates from 60 percent to 38 percent, then it would be a different story, but it looks like supply side policies have reached the point of diminishing marginal returns.
I think Christi has an obligation to finish his term for starters. Also after four years he will be 52 apx we can then see if New Jersey is any better off than it was before. First and for most I think politicians need to finish their terms before going off to other positions.  
Neither your system of government or mine in America is entirely immune to the inefficiency of a high handed bureaucracy as a government. Creating universal healthcare in America is not simply raising taxes and giving it out, the American Government is made up of huge bureaucracies that simply are incapable of spending money efficiently and in a proper way. You seem to think that republicans are calling for no reforms to the healthcare system. They are, everyone is aware of the problems associated with health care but forcing every state to sign up to a program that will raise taxes 500 billion dollars and cut 500 billion from medicare is not the answer. The federal government should only be involved in regulatory measures to make sure that health care providers are not as corrupt as yesteryear and offer tax breaks to certain groups previously ignored. Too much federal govt intervention and subsidies have actually very much increased the cost of health care and pharmaceuticals, a large reason people call for less government in healthcare. Republicans are not cynical, of course if government could simply make the world better and easier everyone would sign up for it but with a large government comes many added burdens that i and many in this country do not want a part of. I dont mean to offend, but honestly try reading into all different sorts of governments, Ive come to the conclusion that i am a republican only after extensive research and weighing my own personal opinion. Dont simply dismiss a whole school of thought as there is a reason people follow it.

The republican voting base really likes medicare, and if they spoke out against it it would be political suicide. The thing is, many voters aren't aware it's a government program, so it works out for the conservatives.
Why the hell would the GOP want to donate money to a Nazi reenactor?
Not always hot air
You know, its funny.   Its like every candidate in the primary is a caricature of themselves.   Newt is overwhelmingly desperate.   Ron Paul comes across as crazy, (his behavior, not his message).  Santorum is overwhelmingly Christian.    Romney is overwhelmingly boring and awkward.   Its like they are all cartoons with exaggerated characteristics.
It was a guy who was part of a reenactment group who just so happened to have to play a Nazi on the part of the presentation. Liberals construe that as actually being a Nazi rather than presenting a historical reenactment. Of course, this is all in the context of Obama not giving back money given to him by a Bill Maher after Maher went on an incredibly sexist rant about Palin on his poor excuse for a show. Typical liberal hypocrisy.
The baby boomers collect their checks, but I shouldn't be forced to pay to take care of myself. How I save and take care of myself is my own buisness. We claim to live in a free country, how is it that in "the land of the free" that we are not allowed to work unless we pay into this idiotic pension plan?

The internet must be great for you, you can express yourself without worrying about that huge hook in your cheek.

Reel him in liberal media!
I think Obama's own actions will help to bring out republican voters.

As the election nears Obama will use every opportunity to blast republicans and liberal media outlets will take every opportunity to put his words on the front page.  People who consider themselves conservatives will feel more and more attacked by the president and will be more willing to oust him, regardless of how they feel about the GOP candidate.
The best I could do was 4/11 on the issues.

Apparently I ought to sit out 2012 and hope for better choices in 2016...

I really wish more conservatives were interested in actually conserving the  country. I'm constantly flabbergasted why rabid protection of the environment is not a central pillar of the Republican party. 
You are missing one important factor: who is running against Obama.  Can any of the GOP nominees beat him?

Also, IMHO, the general public is absolutely clueless about things like spending and budget.  He could spend a trillion dollars on ACA and the retarded celebrity endorsers would still praise him and the general public would still prefer to have a cool black guy in office.
Interesting, I was wondering if I'd get a surprise result, but ended up getting exactly what I expected:

* 1st: Jon Huntsman (Dropped Out)
* 2nd: Barack Obama
* 3rd: Ron Paul

Makes me sad...before he dropped out, I was really hoping that Huntsman would get the nomination and I could vote Republican again.

Unfortunately, though I like a fair amount of what Ron Paul says, there are a few issues that are deal killers for me.
I am not a republican, nor do I live in the North East.  This is based mainly off conjecture, stereotypes, and some limited political experience, however I think the best campaign strategies tend to be a mix of these things.

In my mind the North East is an interesting region.  I am from Oregon and we have a similar kind of republican as in the Northeast.  Socially liberal in some ways, independent minded, skeptical of government policies because of statistics and execution more than philosophy, skeptical of urban power more comfortable with rural and suburban power.  Republicans should play this up.
The Republican Brand is in a world of hurt right now for this demographic, fortunately for them, the Democrats have hurt their image as well.  I would think there are technical issues where republicans have more freedom to flank democrats on where they could come off as being the calm rational party.

* Death With Dignity.  
This is an issue that has become increasingly supported by liberals and attacked by conservatives, however in Oregon this was not the case when it was initially passed nearly 20 years ago.  One of the strongest groups for Death With Dignity has proven to be NRA card carrying white males.  This is an issue that cuts across parties in odd ways. The liberal base clearly supports DWD however suburban Women tend to be uncomfortable with it.  On the republican side some Religions and Religious voters are against it, however libertarians tend to be some of the most ardent supporters.
I would think that this is a good way to in less religious states get the republican party to disassociate with their hyper religious national image.  It is a policy that libertarians support, liberals support, and only religious detractors care that much about.  I think it is an easy issue to bring up that mobilizes the libertarian part of your base, makes you seem more moderate to the independents, and may alienate some religious voters which I think is likely good for attracting moderates in the NE.  But you will possibly hurt your vote with women, which is a demographic republicans desperately desire to reach out too. 
However, if the republican comes out swinging on this personal freedom issue, the Democrat likely has to support it as well.  If they do not then the liberal base will be wildly upset.  This means that you are putting the democrat in a position where they are forced to alienate the woman vote as well, which a suppressed women vote rarely hurts republicans.
So putting a democrat in a position where they must alienate women is the kind of issue you want to have be the forefront of your campaign, even if it alienates them from you as well.
Additionally I think George Bush proved that the compassionate conservative principle works well, this is an issue where giving people an individual choice is compassionate.  While using the line compassionate conservative after the Bush experience would be a faux pas, I think this line of reasoning, of Republicans trying to help people in medical trouble would be an excellent counter to the image of the right having no sympathy when it comes to healthcare hardships.

The big downside is the religious voters.  I don't know the area well enough to really say, but while Catholics are against it in general, nationally Catholics also tend to vote for democrats so that isn't a big loss.  Evangellicals have tied themselves so closely to the republican, and have politisized themselves so much that they likely will still vote, and likely still vote republican.  Meanwhile your image running this campaign would be that you stiffed the religious base which nationally has made republicans seem so crazy.  Moderates in the NE will in my mind see this as a rejection of what turns them off of Republicans national image, hopefully wooing them to your side, with what I would think would be only minor disenfranchisement from the other side.

I am clearly biased, as I am fairly liberal and from a state where this has become an issue of consensus, however I have got to say I think this is an issue that really would divide the democratic party in many ways to talk about, while overall helping the republican image.   Also this won't help as much in federal elections, because it isn't really something that could become a federal issue.

In Massachussettes DWD will be on the ballot, and I expect that Republicans all over the region will come out against it, however it would be very interesting if instead republicans embraced legislation that makes democrats so uncomfortable.  By my calculations the democrats have more to lose by talking about this.

TL DR; The way that Death With Dignity crosses party lines would seem to me to suppress the vote in interest groups in both parties, and separate North Eastern republicans from the toxic national image they have acquired.
Government intervention is not a part of the republican party.

The only thing that doesn't make sense is the military stance.
And not wanting to "fix" climate change by making transportation so prohibitively expensive that the majority of Americans can no longer afford it doesn't mean I don't acknowledge it.
A repeal of ACA would probably help Obama, as he can promise something else.

He isn't running on anything he's actually done.  The economy still stinks, healthcare is still expensive, we're still involved in the middle east, and our debt has only gotten worse.

Obama is running on promises of what he will do, and a huge war chest to attack his opponent with.
"In financing Medicare, the government draws from several sources of revenue: a dedicated Medicare payroll tax, general revenue (primarily federal income taxes), premiums collected from beneficiaries, a 
tax on Social Security benefits, and, since 2006, payments from states for the Medicare drug benefit, which shifted some state Medicaid program expenditures to Medicare."

FICA taxes make up less than 40% of Medicare funding while over 40% is from general revenue (i.e. income taxes).

Huh? When did he read the constitution, when he was shooting up heroin?
I've turned away from him from the beginning. I will never vote for somebody who will get rid of our freedoms for any reason.
It's because there's no differences between them
Good luck with that.

In general, I simply don't think republicans can relate.

Well fuck.
Rick Perry, Obama, Michelle Bachman.
Whoops, echo chamber here. We are all in agreement, thermometers are non-partisan. Now if we Redditors could get the other non-online Republicans to fully acknowledge this, that would be awesome.
The Taliban is as 'removed' as its going to get. It's like a tumor, you can only cut so deep before you are cutting host tissue. 
Unless we have some kind of weapon that blows fundamental religion out of people's heads, there is no strictly military solution to Afghanistan. 
1. Eric Margolis is an idiot. His opinions throughout the entire war have been trash.

2. There were defined goals, you just didn't bother to hear them.

3. Go to Iraq, then decide who won. 
*Hint....It wasn't Saddam. 
You just described why we should never have been there in the first place. Kudos.
Oh, to me getting in to Afghanistan to punch the Taliban in the face was quite justifiable after 9/11. They materially supported people who partook in that attack, so yeah, they need a knock-out.
Whoever thought we wanted to settle down and 'civilize' that chunk of territory, however, is a grade-A idiot. Should have been a quick in/out, wiping out any Talibani we find (they were quite proud of their status and easy to pick out at first), then poof! we gone.
If they start getting antsy again, we just roll in and out again. Nobody spends more than 16 weeks in country. Seems like the only sane way to go.
My idea was to just landmine the whole border near pakistan. Mine it so much nothing could live there for 400 years. Just me.
Are we over 5 trillion in spending yet? Is this a joke? I do like the reduction in military stats that are displayed for absolutely no purpose at all. I dont remember the article mentioning anything about it. I guess I just wouldn't know a thriving economy if it bit me in the ass, right? 14% unemployment? What a crock of shit.
Yeah, but the recession started under a GOP president's watch, right?

Bible thumpers and High School Dropout.
Ron Paul might be destroying Mitt in terms of donations under $200, but that's like bringing a dozen different knives to a gun fight. You might have a lot more knives than your opponent but it's not gonna matter when he's got an actual bullet-spewing gun. (the gun in this case would be the billionaire backing of Frank Vandersloot, and you know, all of Mitt's millions and millions more in funding...)   

(Obligatory But I do hate Mitt)
I'm gonna make another comment with another analogy because I just actually looked at what you were proud of and I've got to say, wow.   

You're like the parents at a soccer game for their kids that are super super excited that their kid's team scored a point....When they're down 10. Ron Paul is getting creamed and you're looking at it and shouting that you've won one battle. 
With the Republicans once again trying to blame all our ills on President Obama I find that once again I have to remind the country that President Bush did this. He as you know was following Reaganism. Reagan was the father of this nightmare. If we are foolish enough to let Romney in he will be influenced to bring us back to the destruction of our version of America and finish us off with Reagan and Bush's version.

Now if you have not yet You have to read this about Ronald Reagan the Destroyer of Main Street! I have been saying it for years and am finally happy to see someone of repute who is not calling him an American hero. He is the Father of this nightmare we are living and it is just beginning. You better be very concerned they want to return to the ways of Ronald Reagan.

They call themselves the party of Ronald Reagan! That scares the hell out of me because Reagan was the Father of the war mongering high Deficit compassionate Conservatives that gave Birth to much war present and future unless Obama can turn around the disaster they created around the world with their war mongering!
I'm not so much *for* Romney as I am *against* Obama.

Sometimes you don't vote for the best man, but rather the guy who you think will do the less-shitty job. 
I fully understand that position... I guess I'm asking why I should have any reason to believe Romney would do a "less-shitty" job. 
Obama is no Calvin Coolidge.
Would you care to elaborate on why you're against Obama? The majority of arguments I've seen attack and criticize Obama on things that Romney doesn't have a solid plan or vision for. I find it hard to see why many independents would want to vote for Romney, he's just been pointing fingers. In my opinion the biggest thing Romney has going for him is going to be the unfathomably large amounts of Super PAC funding this election because of the Citizens United decision.

On top of that, I'd say the results in WI (and CA to a lesser extent) show that the GOP GOTV operations aren't as much of an issue.

It's hard to find a liberal who denies climate change, heck scientific discoveries/understanding.  Conservatives seem to want to deny anything that does not fit in their worldview: gay marriage, climate change, abortion, etc.
Who is to say Romney won't bomb Iran?  McCain thought the idea was hilarious, 4 years ago.
I thought for a second President Obama was going to ask him to leave or just lose it.
At least Mr Obama has class and is a good orator.

This dude is just completely out of line.
I don't agree with you on the former, but the latter is dead on.
Class part is my opinion.  It's displayed here by *not* kicking him out.

What president in the past 20 years has spoken as well as he does?

It doesn't really matter.  It's quite known he speaks at least above average.  Much more so than that last guy.
Just read any NY times best seller on the man, such as "The Amateur" (something Bill Clinton called him) you will then understand the lack of class. What you're referring to is how well he can read off a TelePrompter. And the man was immediately run out, and I'm sure wont ever be back. Also, Obama had zero patience for the man and acted as if he was Caesar. How DARE you interrupt the King?!
He acted as if he were talking.   Which he was.  The 'reporter' was childish.  If you're on his side, you're immature.

This isn't a partisan issue.
Did I not already agree with you on that point? I thought I made that clear. I guess you didnt understand what "the latter" meant. However, I disagree with Obama as having class. I've seen too many examples to believe it to be so, yet I guess that all depends on what you believe to be classy. If you really want, I can give you at least a dozen classless examples... But I'm sure you already know that any American could, so why bother, right? All you need to do is pick up a book, or google. I can also give you many examples of Presidents being interrupted by "Mr. President!", this was simply a rare case of a temporary press pass yielding imbecile yelling it out too early. Normally they'll call out at the end of a sentence, sometimes before the end. He just was an amateur. 

Some off the top of my head: not paying his fathers day meal tab, dissing Netanyahu, lying to the public about his Kenyan birth for self-gain, pushing a woman. Should I bring up more? Let's agree to disagree and keep the "immature" stuff out of it.
The you there was the general 'you' not necessarily you.

Don't take this stuff too personally.

Politicians don't deserve that much of my thoughts or emotions.
ah, Darrell Issa.

The guy is a dick. He's an amoral and unethical dick. All that is stipulated, no contest.

This article, however, is shit. Why does it mention Darrell Issa sweeping for bombs at a baseball game in 1971? Who the fuck cares?

The fact that he has amassed at least $200 million dollars while in office almost entirely through investments is amazingly unlikely without reams of insider knowledge over the years, however, that wasn't even illegal until this year. Heck, there's still loopholes where he could still be doing insider trading legally!

As for persecuting Holder, Holder deserves it. And not just for Fast and Furious. So, Issa is an amoral unethical dick, who happens to be hounding an incompetent, partisan Attorney General. 

This may be one of those stories where there really is no hero, you know?
Guess you're brainwashed, Conservatives want less government. That by definition means more freedom.

**Freedom shouldn't be confused with Free Things** In case you having a tough time understanding that.

*crickets chirping*
USS liberty was the civilian cargo vessel Simmons Victory converted to carry electromagnetic audio-surveillance devices to spy on Israel during a time of war.

Next time, don't try to get close to spy on a country which is in the midst of a major war with its enemies.

Even Egypt which was at war with Israel then thinks so. Read it [here](http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/515763).

Anyway, the truth is "Both the Israeli and U.S. governments conducted inquiries and issued reports that concluded the attack was a mistake due to Israeli confusion about the identity of the USS Liberty.

In May 1968, the Israeli government paid US$3,323,500 as full payment to the families of the 34 men killed in the attack. In March 1969, Israel paid a further $3,566,457 in compensation to the men who had been wounded. On 18 December 1980, it agreed to pay $6 million as settlement for the U.S. claim of $7,644,146 for material damage to the Liberty itself.

On December 17, 1987, the issue was officially closed by the two governments through an exchange of diplomatic notes." 

**This was the first and ONLY(!) incident, 45 years ago, where Israel killed (friendly fire) American Soldiers.**

If anyone think that today, 2012, or since this incident in 1967, that Israel is trying to kill Americans or hurt them, then they are delusional.

Israel is the best friend of the USA, more than Europe, Russia, China, South America, etc.

Better to concentrate on the real enemies of the USA instead of unexplained and irrational hate for Israel.

According to the [CBO](http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/87xx/doc8711/12-6-immigration.pdf), "tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use." This makes sense - you can pay into the government if you're an immigrant, but you can't get Social Security, for example.

Is it as much as another US citizen? It probably depends - which income bracket are we talking about, and are we including tax credits (e.g. homeowner's, child, etc.)? I can't find anything on that. What I can find is that they do take out less money from the government than the average US citizen because they're afraid of being caught.

EDIT: I can find something about whether or not they do. It's only one source (so it's not scientifically conclusive), but according to a 1998 [Urban Center report](http://www.urban.org/publications/407432.html#III), "although individual tax contributions of illegal aliens are not trivial—totaling over $1.1 billion—average tax contributions of undocumented aliens are substantially less than those of the legal foreign-born." This is due to a substantially lower income and lower compliance with taxation. Of course, they pay in to the government more than they take out, but illegal immigrants seem to pay less in taxes than legal immigrants.
Of course this is the case with the majority of people who pay income tax as well. Nobody in the top bracket is getting their money's worth. You pay a million in taxes to essentially use roads. 

I would say the answer is "depends on the citizen" but obviously they contribute less on average, according to your post.
This is a great response. 

The one major area always discussed when bringing up this topic is income tax. Illegal immigrants being paid "under the table" is money that is not reported by the business owner or the immigrant. With all this current back and forth over illegal immigration and taxes I'm surprised more people aren't making noise about the Fair Tax as this has the potential to positively impact both arguments.   
Most poor people pay no taxes at all.  And the vast majority of illegals would be considered poor.

It's not very fair for the immigrants who got here legally to be told, well you didn't have to go through that long process.  That's why you would find the people here in America who most want to crack down on illegal immigrants are in fact legal immigrants.

I agree it's way to hard to become a citizen, and I agree we should make it easier.  But whether our past presidents did it or not, I truly believe its an issue that must be resolved.

Doesn't the fact that Mitt Romney would give such a wild card like Clint Eastwood such a prominent role at such an important moment in his campaign make Mitt's decision skills look bad. 

It was primetime and he was the third last speaker and they just rolled him out and said "yea...um...say...whatever you want, Clint"? I would love to hear a Republican's take on that speech and it's impact.

Thanks for the tip.  I watched Ryan's speech and it was rather long.  Ann Romney of course was not quite as effective and Condoleeza was perfect!
Or Rubio
Guys, come on.  We all know he has to show Clint Eastwood's...

Ok, all kidding aside; Rubio's speech was really good and fairly short.  I think in your setting that would be the best one.
I agree, the problem I have with these government "fixes" is will they really fix the problem, or will they just make things worse.
I went in expecting to hate this video. Instead, I found it to be a well done concise example of where I think liberals over-reach on regulations. Good stuff!

Still, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that I absolutely loathe the Republican plank of anti-abortion, and lately anti-contraception. That's not small government any more than this video highlights being inclusive or "pro-choice".
Yea, I love the republican "choice" of having to be forced to have a rape baby. That's totally in the same category as regulating soft drinks. This video compares comparable things.
Let me ask you something, do you know what a leveraged buy-out is? You know what they were doing with those on wall-street in the 80's and 90's? That executive that defends Bain at the end of this piece was payed millions to let Bain literally drain the company. 

Oh, but all the fucking companies where the same thing happened over and over after Bain bought them--that didn't happen. No, because they guy is only a union organizer for ALL the fucking people who worked there.

So... how's that whole "war on women" thing been workin' out for ya? Still totally not doing that, right?

You wanna talk about an ambush?  I ambushed you with a cup of coffee.

LOL.
Wow, hawkish rhetoric from Brett Decker, a once Sr VP of Pentagon Credit Union? Let me grab a grain of salt.
FTA
&gt;The White House responded by claiming that President Obama reads daily intelligence reports, even if he does not attend the briefings personally.

Seems like a reasonable and logical explanation. In any event I highly doubt that the PDB could have forewarned that a right-wing kook named Terry Jones was going to go stirring up a hornets nest in Egypt with his Koran burning traveling carnival show, which is what OP headline seems to imply.
I don't really follow you there, seems like you blame Terry Jones for the deaths, not the people who actually committed the targeted killing. Also, it doesn't seem as though the goodwill the current administration has tried to establish (through a strange mix of emphatic, moving speeches and drone strikes, as well as cheering on the Arab spring and providing aid to rebels in Libya) has worked all that well. Or maybe I am way off base here...nope
President Obama asleep at the wheel (again), its unconscionable he was not present for these briefings all during the week prior to a 9/11 anniversary, and laughable to claim "reads daily intelligence reports" therefore he's involved.
There's nothing wrong with criticizing Jones just because what the Egyptians did was far worse. The proper response is in the works as we speak on that front; Marines are moving in to see that justice is done. Jones is still a nutcase whose irresponsible hate speech should be condemned by responsible citizens. Free speech is a two way street. And where I come from,  trying to spread goodwill wherever you can is a good thing as opposed to the kind of blundering, blustering and impotent saber rattling we've been seeing from the Romney campaign.
OK, but... you didn't criticize the Egyptians, you criticized Terry Jones, which is fine of course, but a little off target. I suppose you were looking for a way to make anybody but the current administration bear responsibility, and would blame Bush for it if you could get away with it. 
Will Republicans ever get tired of the false equivalencies? In the same week further proof (of what we knew all along, really) that W had repeated warnings about the 9/11 attacks and failed to act emerges, now comes along some Breitbart "journalism" about President Obama not attending briefings for a week? Do you really believe that this ginned up controversy in the middle eastern media would have been included in those briefings for anything but the day before the Libya attack, at best?

Don't worry, though, this will let you stick your head back in the sand for another night, secure in the knowledge that "their" guy is just as bad as "your" guy, and not *really* examine the facts... how much longer do you think you can keep this up?
Do you have a cite that shows Bush II didn't even show up to his briefings?  
If he's got time for Letterman, he's got time for his Intel Briefings, especially when he's running intel led wars in five countries.  
&gt;you criticized Terry Jones, which is fine of course, but a little off target.

Well my comment was that Jones stirred up a hornets nest, to which the metaphor "hornets nest" was meant to convey a negative connotation towards the Egyptians. To my mind it's a worse criticism than I gave Jones who I at least criticized as being a human being. 

&gt;you were looking for a way to make anybody but the current administration bear responsibility, and would blame Bush for it if you could get away with it. 

I would argue that the right wing is the one looking for a way to cast blame here. Rational people realize that these sort of incidents happen no matter who is in office. There were many such incidents during the Bush administration as well and probably under every presidency in modern history. 

I will grant you that had this happened under Bush, I might have argued that Bush's tendency towards cowboy diplomacy was not exactly helping ease middle east tensions; your side argues that Obama's unwillingness to speak loudly and wave the big stick around is not helping; The truth is, this kind of shit happens, to every president. 

But the idea that any mainstream democrat would sympathize with the Egyptian mob who did this is laughable and not based in any form of reality. It would be one thing for surrogates and fringe characters to imply this, but the fact that your "mainstream" Presidential candidate is promoting this idea is costing the Republican party credibility with independents and soft democrats. It's a major contributing factor to why Romney is very likely going to lose in November and may even tip the Congress back to the Dems; it's a symptom of a serious malady that is slowly infecting the Republican party, which is starting to show signs of drifting towards irrelevancy; the libertarians are standing by, awaiting their moment of heavy MTV rotation.

Nope. Nor do I have anything in my post that makes such a claim.
&gt;In the same week further proof (of what we knew all along, really) that W had repeated warnings about the 9/11 attacks and failed to act emerges

How about this?
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html
So are we holding them both accountable?  Or absolving them both?
The [PDB are DOCUMENTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_Daily_Brief). Not meetings.
What a stupid jumble of words that make zero sense. Just stop posting and go back to your circlejerk you vapid ignoramus.
Again, false equivalency. Bush clearly had repeated forewarnings, for months, of the biggest terrorist attack ever and failed to act, costing thousands upon thousands of American lives. Bush clearly bears some serious responsibility here

At this point we have no idea if Obama not attending foreign policy briefings for a week, and choosing to read the briefing papers instead, played any role in this tragedy. Would his foreign policy advisors have warned that a YouTube video was about to help some crazies in Libya stir up a controversy, and security should be increased at the embassy? If so, would that warning only have come via an actual meeting but not in the briefing papers? If that can be demonstrated then, yes, Obama should bear some responsibility for those 4 deaths - but there's some serious hurdles to clear before that blame can be assigned, and to equate that with Bush failing to act to prevent 9/11 is insane.
Right.  So much like the economy it's only the president's fault when they've got a D after their name.  
Um, what?
Congrats, you have successfully identified the content of my post as "words." Perhaps one day you'll be able to understand what words mean when placed near each other.
Mr. Republican (R).  Mr. Democrat (D).  
Yeah, i get how that works, dude, but i think your reading comprehension skills are sorely lacking.
There are a few things, as a moderate Republican, that I wish the party would change about it and this is one of them.  Clearly the climate has changed noticeably from what it was, say, 40 years ago.  Last year it snowed in October where I am for goodness sake, and the rest of the winter we didn't see a single flake of snow.  

The other couple of things I wish they'd agree with are gay marriage (which I don't necessarily agree with, but you can't tell the people what to do), and pro-choice (because, again, you can't tell people what to do); however, the government shouldn't have to pay for the lifestyle choices that women make in regards to abortion and whatnot.  These three changes will make a much friendlier, and popular image for our party, I believe. 
Because the purpose of that event was suppose to be about Romney and how great he is. Instead you're still talking about Clint Eastwood's speech that is being considered an embarrassment. 
Rather than give each individual detail and point of a general republican view. The current platform is based on a few things. Personal Responsibility, Limited Govt., Strong Business and Middle Class,  Preservation of certain traditional values, the sanctity of life, and strong policies on immigration and foreign affairs when it is needed.
[deleted]
Thank you.  this really helps as a jumping off point for me to learn more about the platform.
Republicans think that the government does a poor job of allocating resources.  By limiting the size of government and leaving it to the private sector to offer as many services as possible, accountability is spread widely which makes society sleeker, more rational, and less wasteful.  Furthermore, it's the natural tendency of irresponsible politicians to want to increase the size of government indefinitely, and these politicians choose the Democratic Party to promote their ambitions.  There's really all sorts of evidence to support both these beliefs.
But beliefs they both are.
I have gone back and forth a lot on this election, and what broke it for me was the realization that i don't think the government has earned the right to do what they want next; yeah, healthcare for slightly higher taxes sounds awesome (my fellow repubs will disagree here), but do you really think our govt deserves to control that?look at what happened with the countless programs before it. Yes, military spending is partially to blame,.but the government does a terrible job at paying for things, hence our debt. Do you really want to give them even more power? It's like giving your kid who crashed your Honda accord keys to your bentley. Sorry for formatting, on phone

This Redditor has it right. Well done, fellow Republican.
"Not overly one-sided"

Oh, you.
From Wikipedia (I know, liberal bias right?)

&gt;Economists disagree about the causes of this downturn. Keynesian economists assign blame to cuts in federal spending and increases in taxes at the insistence of the US Treasury,[4] while monetarists, such as Milton Friedman, assign blame to the Federal Reserve's tightening of the money supply in 1936 and 1937.[5] Austrian school economist Johnathan Catalan assigns blame to the relatively large expansion of the money supply from 1933 to 1937. He also notes that the money supply did not tighten until after the recession began.[6]

Interesting that is was the Keynesian economists who blamed this particular recession on the tax hikes (and cuts). Are you sure you want to align yourself with Keynesians in today's Republican political climate.

The article fails to mention that Roosevelt's wealth tax raised taxes on the highest earners to 75%, nowhere near the 38.5% (from 35%) that Obama is proposing and that also didn't cause a recession when Clinton did it. So even if Roosevelt's tax hike did cause the recession (which economists disagree about), the article is still comparing apples to oranges in it's attempt to stoke fear. It also neglects to mention anything about the spending cuts enacted at the same time ( and unfortunately Obama is also heading down this road with his four trillion dollar spending cut proposal) 

Furthermore, after the wealth tax was passed, most of the richest people were still avoiding it because of tax loopholes, leading to the Revenue act of 37, which closed most of these combined with the very progressive Victory Tax of 42 leading to 90% tax compliance by 1945.

The Great Depression ended in 1941 by the way. 




The money quote?

&gt;What I think will re-engage people in politics is if we’re doing significant, serious policy work around what I will label the ‘working poor,’” he said, “although my definition of the working poor is not simply folks making minimum wage, but it’s also families of four who are making $30,000 a year.”

&gt;“They are struggling. And to the extent that we are doing research figuring out what kinds of government action would successfully make their lives better, we are then putting together a potential majority coalition to move those agendas forward.”

Hmm, I don't really see anything particularly...Oh, wait, I forgot to put on my conservative worldview glasses. Ok, everyone got theirs on now? Alright. Let's proceed and try again. 


&gt;What I think will re-engage people in politics is if we’re doing significant, serious policy work around what I will label the ~~‘working poor,’”~~ **welfare recipients**, he said, “although my definition of the ~~working poor~~ **welfare recipeints** is not simply ~~folks~~ **black people** making minimum wage, but it’s also **non-white** families of four who are making $30,000 a year.”

&gt;“They are ~~struggling~~ **ready to rise up**. And to the extent that we are ~~doing research~~ **community organizing** [and] figuring out what kinds of ~~government action~~ **welfare programs** would successfully ~~make their lives better~~ **buy their loyalty**, we are then putting together a potential ~~majority coalition~~ **army of mutha's sista's and brotha's** to move ~~those~~ **our socialist** agenda forward.”

It's so clear now. I have to remember to put those on whenever I come in here. 





My thought on this is that both governments and corporations can be equally inefficient and equally as wasteful. Our healthcare system is one of the most expensive, inefficient systems in the world and it's 100% run by corporations. [45,000 people die every year](http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/17/us-usa-healthcare-deaths-idUSTRE58G6W520090917) because they don't have healthcare insurance. 

The way America seems to run best is when the government and corporations act as a check and balance against each other. Whenever either one gets too powerful, problems emerge.  The Affordable Care Act achieves this, not perfectly, but is a start in my opinion, because it keeps the issuance of health-care in the hands of for profit corporations with the government acting as a needed check against the inherent tendency of corporations to maximize short term profits, often at the expense of long term gains. 

It is by no means a perfect system, and in many ways it's a compromise that will be subject to further legislation over time, but at least when government is engaged it is subjected to the scrutiny of "we the people" as voters and activists, rather than being purely beholden only to the shareholders as all corporations are, by their very nature.  

It's not a black and white, cut and dried issue but at least the ACA (which is the same basic program Republicans proposed in the nineties as an alternative to "Hillarycare") addresses the very real problem as opposed to the (modern) Republican's bury your head in the sand,  tax-cut's-fix-everything, trickle down (and out) approach.
I'm curious also.  I've seen a video where Milton Freedman refuses to do an interview because the interviewer hadn't read Capitalism and Freedom.  It must be a very important book.

Does it ever make you idiots wonder why there are so few republicans on reddit?

Let me enlighten you.

The more information you are able to access the more obvious it is the all republicans care about is rich white people.  If you dont fit that demographic then i cant understand why you would ever vote republican, mentally challenged I suppose
Political Moderates probably don't rely too much on thedailycaller.com 

Nobody's "fired up" about Romney as much as they're fired up against Obama. And Biden?? Can't wait what he has to say at the debates...
That username...
This seems like a liberal troll post
If Republicans lose this election, which should by all accounts be a slam dunk in a 5 foot hoop, then they need and deserve to be disbanded and replaced by true conservatives, ones who stood for freedom and small government, not god and guns and ignorance.  
I'm fired up for Romney! I'll take the mormon over the moron 
It so unfortunate that this isnt uncommon. If Romney loses the election it's because people don't know jack shit about Obama yet they'll still vote for him. If people actually followed politics they'd know the obvious choice is Romney.
HELL YEAH, NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WISCONSIN ARE SWINGIN' WITH BIG **MITT** NOW TOO!
shittyaskarepublican

FTFhim
Good on you OP. I don't know why more people on Reddit aren't talking about this. It's insane.
So if they win, it's a slam dunk, if they lose, they are rotten to the core and need to be disbanded.

That's such a weird mindset.
Someone is down there rubbing his thigh.
Did I say rotten to the core? No, you did. Grow up kid.

What I am saying is that this far right wingnuts have hijacked the party of overall small government and now stand for lower taxes with a priority for the very wealthy, and higher spending on military, police and drug enforcement, because they need to intimidate or kill those who don't agree with them. These ideas are unpopular and quite frankly unamerican, and therefore people are more willing to vote for a socialist, who also stands for unamerican ideals, rather than these backwards fools.   
So you think Romney voters are all completely informed?

There always is dumb people on both sides. I remember when someone presented some of Obama's policies and said they were McCains. They showed that they supported them fully. 

A huge percentage of voters are too uninformed to make a proper decision based on facts etc

Sorry, but forcing a religious pro-life position on the masses is the epitome of big, intrusive government.
I think it's important to note that Children's Television Workshop requested the ad should be pulled, and I agree. Much like children should not be subjected to making a lifelong commitment to religion, political matters should abstain from their programming.
Very neat little test, though certainly not something to base a vote on. 88% percent Mitt was higher than I thought, but not overly surprising. 
There was a recent post on the front page with the exact opposite: a fast talking woman who called obama a communist and then couldn't explain what she meant.

http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/2012-election/video-woman-calls-pres-obama-communist-cant-say-why

Perhaps these types of things are because people are too embarrassed to say they don't know to a media rep, so they bullshit. I can hold up examples of the uninformed to you and then claim a representative sample for any candidate. 

TL;DR this really doesn't say anything.

A good article on some of the "comeback" answers to tough questions.
I hate to sound unsympathetic, but this guy makes a bunch of terrible decisions and (surprise!) ends up in really bad shape.

* He has a family history of cancer
* He quit his job with benefits without another one to go to because of midlife crisis
* He doesn't look for a full-time job for the next 8 years
* He ignores difficulty with urination in 2011
* He ignores blood in his urine in 2012
* He's not getting annual physicals and he's 52
* Blames his apathy about his health checkups on it being a "guy thing"
* Basically, he just pissed away all concerns about his health and now wants the state to rush to his rescue

What might have cost a relatively small amount of money to treat with early detection will now cost well over half a million.

There may be a point to make about people without healthcare coverage dying prematurely, but this guy is not it. Even if we had single payer, there would still be that segment of the population that makes stupid decisions about their healthcare that ends up costing the rest of us a shit ton of money.

This guy isn't the poster child for government sponsored health care; this guy is the poster child for responsible health education.
I got 95% Romney. We are a very small population on reddit.
A really good article on the whole Candy Crowley fiasco.
This article is a tactic used by Democrats and those on the left all the time-an appeal to emotion.  Emotion must be out of all political discourse.  Most people don't make the risky decisions like Scott did, because they can more fully appreciate the risks that they are taking.  What the actuarial tables will not tell you upfront, is that yes it is unlikely, but if in the unlikely event that it happens, you can die.  I don't think Scott truly appreciated that risk when he took it.

So, this article seems to say that Obamacare will eleviate that risk.  If so, you can expect more people to make this decision and thus make less money, damage their career and become dependant on the government.

Whilst this article tried to stem up an emotional response to get people to switch to Obamacare, it made clear the point that it seeks to dis-incentivize the need to work, because your healthcare will be taken care of.  Please do use his example as the poster boy for Obamacare.  It will only further show the American people that it will make it easier for people to want to stop working and stop being responsible
Pretty interesting article!
92% Obama.  Just posting to let anyone know that the results aren't purposely skewed to the left or right.
89% Romney....

ooooyeaaa :)
Good article! It touches on the last murder of a U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs in 1979 which was called "Significant act of terror" and how the Obama administration mishandled Libya. Wonder how much this will come up today in these last debates.
The US century old war on drugs is not a war against intoxicating substances. It's a war against people--usually people of color--and the ultimate expression of white Protestant prerogative power, exported to the world.
a really good perspective on the final debates
I do not like the fact that he both candidates support drone strikes. These attacks have killed countless civilians who now think of the US as an enemy. I would have whole heartedly supported the candidate who proposed a better solution. 
I don't get why people think the technology is somehow important. Drone strikes are far *better* than the alternatives. Artillery kills more civilians, air strikes kill more civilians. And the opponents technique of blowing up civilians damn well kills more civilians. 

Drones are an effective tool so there is a large propaganda campaign against them over there. Don't confuse that with reality.
If the main objective is to stem the spread of terrorist groups such as the Al Qaeda, the last thing we should be doing is using methods that make the general populace hate us, driving up their recruitment. That's just my two cents. Edit: spelling 


But the methods do not actually make the general populace hate us. I have not see any evidence that drone strikes are helpful for recruiting.

Now if you have a better way to fight a guerrilla war I would love to hear it. But targeted killings is pretty effective. 
Actually, there is [pretty solid evidence that drone strikes have increased negative opinions of the U.S. abroad.](http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/13/global-opinion-of-obama-slips-international-policies-faulted/)
Im perfectly fine with drones. Better than having our own troops in harm's way if we can quietly spy on these people and take them out from a control room. The fact is, in the middle east, most nations aren't our friends. They act that way when it's beneficial to them and they get what they want, they stab you in the back. When you're in a war, you either worry about "innocent" civilians and get your own guys killed, or you don't give a shit about who's in your way and teach the "innocents" that it is not ok to aid, harbor or supply our enemies or they risk their lives doing so. If someone truly is innocent, and they're lost, it's sad, but it's a reality of war. You can't change that. There ARE going to be innocent casualties if we are to be successful. The insurgents' practice of using human shields ensures that as an absolute.
Yes, there is a strong successful  propaganda campaign regarding drones. Somehow people think that drones are worse than air strikes. The problem is that drone strikes are precise. Precision means you get your target with minimum collateral deaths, but it also means you can identify those deaths. 50 deaths don't have names, 2 or 3 do.



Does it actually matter if air strikes are worse than drones? That's a false dichotomy. The options aren't "air strikes or drones", they're "air strikes, drones, or *nothing*". People aren't comparing the drones to air strikes in their minds. They're comparing drones to no U.S. attacks of any kind. It doesn't require propaganda to see that that's probably what people prefer. 
&gt;Does it actually matter if air strikes are worse than drones? That's a false dichotomy. The options aren't "air strikes or drones", they're "air strikes, drones, or nothing". 

Nope. You are busy presenting this as "Drones are bad". If you want to argue "Leave the al Qaeda leadership alone" then make that argument instead.


Perhaps I should have stated what I meant more clearly. I'm not talking about any actual military decision. I'm talking about the perceptions of various military decisions by the people they affect. So when I say "the options are air strikes, drones, or nothing", I mean that the alternatives people consider *when they form their opinions of the United States* are air strikes, drones, or nothing, and I think it's quite self-evident that most people would prefer the last. 
There is somehow this ability among many to treat the U.S. as a distinct figure. There is lots of magic hand waving that says if it were not for the U.S. everything would be peaceful.  If the U.S. drone strikes were the only violence in the area I would strongly oppose them. It isn't. A drone strike is far better than a couple of suicide bombings in a market. Do you think that 1% of the Pakistanis killed by by political violence are killed by Americans? I doubt it.



[deleted]
No, but again, that's irrelevant. As you can see in the Malala Yousafzai incident and the outpouring of support for her, Pakistanis also don't support the Taliban--you should see some of the acrimony Pakistani newspapers are printing. (For example, the Frontier Post in Peshawar printed that the Taliban "wears the mask of a deceptive religiosity" while being "vile plain murderers who slaughter even children just for the pleasure of it.") I'm not saying that if it weren't for the U.S. everything would be peaceful, and I don't think they expect that either. They have simply, and correctly, attributed violence against them to its sources.  
Not acting like a bully doesn't mean you're humiliating yourself.  If anything it gives you more sense of pride, and other people a greater sense of respect for you.
This partisanship is what bothers me, it's especially prevalent within our Republican party. There is nothing wrong with looking at the President you didn't vote for and agree with what he's doing. You don't have to be 100% against everything he does and throw partisan political spin to it. 

Bush did a number on how America was viewed internationally. Obama did a great job patching up those relationships and transitioning "Follow my lead because I am the biggest guy here, with the biggest guns. Listen to what I say, or else you will pay" to "Follow me, not only because I am the toughest guy on the block, but because you respect me and choose to follow me."

I don't think Obama was apologizing, he was making it clear that the regime has changed and he wants to start listening and leading the our allies in a less aggressive manner. There are a lot of things I disagree with Obama on, but this is not one of them. 
Guess what Republicans: Bush was terrible and Iraq was a clusterfuck, an error upon a blunder upon a lie. Admitting it was wrong was the right thing to do. Just because Bush screwed us is not a reason for Obama to lie about it.


Do republicans not remember that Bush (rightfully) apologized for Abu Ghraib? Besides the fact that this whole apology tour nonsense is a classic "big lie" (repeat it enough and it becomes true), there's nothing wrong with apologizing when we do something wrong. People understand it's an imperfect world and will do a lot of forgiving when you own up to your mistakes and it truly does take more courage to admit you're not perfect than to stubbornly clench your fists and proclaim that being an American is never having to say you're sorry. 

This whole line of attack is weakness masquerading as strength and nothing more. 
Redditor posts facts to support his argument, another redditor claims it to be propaganda just because it doesn't fit their world view.

Nice.
No, I said that there was a propaganda campaign that affects public opinion. What was not shown was an increase in civilian deaths due to drones.
Acknowledging reality = bad.  GOP 2012.

For one thing, if you're legally blind and can't drive, I think that DOES justify taking government assistance. Meanwhile, most of the people who are sitting around smoking pot all day and being lazy and ignorant...they don't deserve it, yet millions of those types of people receive welfare every single day.

Also, many people are voting for Obama just because of his progressive view on certain issues and how he's prying religion out of the picture. Obama is pro-gay marriage and pro-abortion where as Mitt Romney is against those things; a lot of people voting for Obama are voting for him purely on social liberalism and not on fiscal policy whatsoever. It's sad, but a lot of our generation (I'm 19) is just too nearsighted to care about anything else other than some single-issue cause they think is a big deal. (They ignore that the President can't singlehandedly change federal marriage laws and he still has to pitch it to a roughly equally divided Congress).

Lastly, I think you're kind of preaching to the choir here. A lot of what you say ties in with exactly what the Republican view is, so you're gonna get a lot of "Yep, that's about the sum of it" from /r/republicans. I'd half-recommend posting this in /r/politics to see if any reasonable folk there can give you a straight answer from the other side; but also be aware that Reddit tends to be very liberal (out of hundreds of millions of users, only around 900 frequent /r/republicans) and that posting anything daring to question Obama's policies may result in being downvoted to all hell.
&gt;(They ignore that the President can't singlehandedly change federal marriage laws and he still has to pitch it to a roughly equally divided Congress)

This also applies to the flipside.
Not all Democrats believe that they are entitled to welfare or other free government help. I know plenty of upper-middle class people, some who even started their own businesses, who are still going to vote for Obama. I think the Democrat argument is that there are some people so entrenched in poverty that they can't even climb out of it to start saving any money, let alone start their own business. They say that government help can allow people to break down that wall of poverty and make themselves a better life. Now, it's up to you to decide if that's true and if the government can actually help, but I'm just trying to be as accurate as possible in what they say. 

(I wouldn't say I'm affiliated with any party, but feel free to correct me if I sound biased either way) 
I would like to say that your ideas about Democrats and more specially Obama are vastly incorrect and feel that your view point is more than a bit slanted.  "People who are going to vote for Obama are doing so because they believe health care, free money, free food, and unemployment is owed to them" is really just a Fox News talking point to try to enrage conservatives against Obama and Obama supporters however only captures a small percentage of people who actually believe the statement.

The differences between a Democratic and Republican view point essentially in how people who are less fortunate get support.  Republicans would lead you to believe that they are against social programs (except Social Security) while Democrats believe social programs are essential for growth and ensuring a prosperous future (which is where you get Obama's small business reference).  The problem is that social programs are more beneficial to people in specific classes of wealth.  For the wealthy, they find less benefit from these social programs and thus feel they are unnecessary and should be cut while the poor often need welfare and other social programs to survive and would argue that mortgage deductions, property tax write offs, lower estate taxes are unnecessary.

However, the fact is that the United State of America would not be the greatest country on earth without the social programs and government spending which brought us the infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc) and public education needed to be the world power we are.  While the free market economy allows for tremendous potential for growth and prosperity.  


Great way to put it.  
Thank you so much for this. It really helped me to understand things better. :) 
You don't sound biased to me. It's so hard to decide what you believe in and what you think is right. It's a lot to take it for me and I want to get as much information as I can to make my vote more educated and not just because someone told me one thing over another. 
I just feel like everyone is going to vote for Obama now because of the fact that he is now pro same sex marriage and pro legalizing marijuana when he was highly against both things when he was running four years ago. I feel like he is doing it just for more votes. 
There's a lot of things Obama is doing just for more votes. The one I can come up with right off the top of my head is how he rounded up illegal immigrants and issued an executive order to make them citizens - so now, obviously, all of those people are going to vote for him as a thanks - they're now legal citizens, they can vote. Pretty abrupt decision before the election, eh, to just let them all be citizens under his administration?

I think Obama won in 2008 not so much because of his policies, but because he was a black candidate that had a real chance - so a lot of people voted him in just on the novelty that he'd be the first black president. I don't have a statistic to prove that, but in high school, right when a lot of the juniors and seniors were getting the ability to vote, they were all ignorant enough to vote for Obama just on that - it didn't matter whose policies were better.

That being said, I think people are legitimately voting for Obama this time around as a "lesser of two evils:" even though Romney is pretty moderate for a Republican, a lot of people still don't like his conservative views on marriage, religion, what-have-you, so Obama is the shinier of two turds in their eyes. This is why a lot of people favor third-party candidates who just don't get as much face time on TV. We're too bipartisan for that.
Its not hard to climb from rock bottom if you actually put some effort into it. I'm up from homeless to renting my own apartment with a job in about a year with no government assistance. 
nobody has died from warrantless wiretapping but that still doesn't make it right
meh, who's bias is showing now? reading your post was like listening to rachel maddow (not a good thing BTW).

look, the difference is real simple.

republicans think the best way to help someone who is capable and down on his/her luck is to create an environment where that person is better able to get a job, and better able to use the money earned at that job to better their lives.

they do this by making it easier for small business owners to do business. democrats tax and regulate businesses into the ground, republicans do everything they can cut taxes and cut overbearing regulations.

in other words, the promote independence.

republicans also recognize that a certain percentage of our population is not able to work, not able to provide for themselves... those people have always been a part of the equation. fiscal conservatives (a core "republican" value) favor more stringent controls on public assistance to stop those who abuse the system, and thus be able to better provide for those who are in need. these same "greedy republicans" you liberals jabber jaw about, time after time, give more to charity than their democrat counterparts.

conversely democrats tend to believe that rather than provide employment and opportunity to succeed in life, that all people should be provided for, no matter their ability, provided they vote democrat.

they peddle dependence and economic slavery.

republicans, in general are for you keeping more of the money you earn while democrats are for stealing more of the money you earn.

conservative republicans have also always stand on the principal that infrastructure and boarders are worthwhile expenditures, despite the constant insistence from the left that cutting taxes a few percent would mean no roads or bridges or trains or police or fire or schools (chicken little much?).

half of what you mentioned as a slam against republicans are their strong points... you sir are far more conservative than MSNBC and the huffington post would leave you to believe.


Hundreds of thousands died from Nixon's secret war in Laos and Cambodia. Hundreds of thousands dies from Bush's unnecessary war in Iraq.

I think my take is certainly less biased than yours.  Republicans always argue for less social programs mostly sighting there is just too much fraud.  I don't think anyone will argue against getting rid of fraud and I have never heard anyone claim "lets support more fraud."  

Now, **"the best way to help someone who is capable and down on his/her luck is to create an environment where that person is better able to get a job, and better able to use the money earned at that job to better their lives"** is a common belief from I would say any common sense person( "Give a person a fish, teach a person to fish").  The problem is that if a job pays $5 an hour then how can you possibly buy health care, food, shelter all while paying taxes(consumption and payroll).  You can work 100 hour a week at $5 an hour and still can't make ends meet.  Now republicans will fight for the free market where businesses can pay what they want (so $5/hr may be too much) while a more liberal stance would be to ensure a minimum standard of pay to ensure that the money earned can buy you at least good health.

Anyway, I'm not going to waste more time replying to your obviously "offended" response but you seriously need to think "would any persons wanting to make the country better do these things?"  Democrats want to tax and regulate all businesses so they can't operate because ... they get a bigger pay check? So a bus driver can have a yacht? garbage man drive a Lamborghini? Give free money to all? Because common sense says that's sustainable, right? Your lack common sense runs through your response.

We all want government to run more efficiently (again why would anyone not want this... take our tax money and waste it!). But the undeniable difference is fundamental, Republicans want to cut the broader social spending (education, infrastructure, healthcare) to increase how much money the **individual** can keep while the democrats believe that education, infrastructure, and healthcare are essential to give people the opportunity to be happy and successful.  We all saw how well this idea work for the Republicans during the GW Bush years (great while it lasted).
Ike took us into Vietnam and Bay of Pigs was planned under Ike. Oh, and Ike overthrew Mosaddegh.
Not everyone is climbing from rock bottom in the same place. Also, rock bottom for some may be some social norm for others. Just by saying you were homeless and now you rent isn't a reason to believe everyone one can do it "if they actually put some effort into it." No two cities/environments are the same, nor are two people. 
So change yourself, or move. If there's no jobs in your town, move to another town. I hear people who live in Washington DC gripe about how they can't find work. Well, it's a city, jobs are competitive. I live in West Virginia, and as hillbilly suck-ass as this place is, we have jobs. Plenty of help wanted signs. You'll get paid less, but living here costs less.

As for "nor are two people," you're either hire-able or not. If you don't have qualifications, go to school (public/private loans; scholarships; grants; etc.) If you don't have skills, learn one. Libraries have books and free Internet, surely you can educate yourself at one.

You set your own destiny. Not the government and honestly not your family either. This isn't Europe where you're born into your class and you stay there. There's unlimited opportunities in America and you don't need government assistance to take advantage of them, you just need to invest some time and effort into it. 
I totally agree with what you are saying about setting your own destiny and its not the governments duty too. However, everyone cannot just move ie. someone who started a family. some people do have jobs in competitive places, some even have multiples, but they still need government assistance for one reason or another. The thing you said about going to school, democrats and many republicans are strong supporters of that and wish to allocate funding there. **All in all, not every situation is as cut and dry as just go get a job and be somebody.** In theory it works; in life jobs aren't that easy to get, people need to put their money in different places for various reason and it is the government duty to take care of their citizens.
&gt;However, everyone cannot just move ie. someone who started a family.

Why not? Moving sucks, you lose touch with your friends, sure. We have telephones and the Internet...get over it. Finding a job is more important. If you have to uproot your family to support your family, you do it. Plain and simple.

&gt;some people do have jobs in competitive places, some even have multiples, but they still need government assistance for one reason or another.

Really? Because I fully supported myself on a minimum wage job and got by just fine. And I was paying my own tuition to a $26,000/year private college. Didn't ask for a dime from the government and the number of times I asked friends for money to cover me for lunch is enough to count on one hand. Oh, and I walked away with a credit score that acclaims me like a Hollywood starlet. It's not hard to be successful. I invested my money, I saved my money, I didn't spend money on fruitless things like cable TV, cigarettes, or Internet that melts my face off. I lived pretty basically and I still had money for a nice cell phone and to go piss away at the casino once a week.

&gt;school, democrats and many republicans are strong supporters of that and wish to allocate funding there.

I'm not so much talking about public education at a elementary/middle/HS level. I'm talking about college. There are so so so many opportunities to get a full ride to college. All you have to do is pass your classes in school and you can get mounds of scholarships. If your household income is low, they'll give you grants for that too (the Pell Grant). It's not hard to pay for school.

&gt;All in all, not every situation is as cut and dry as just go get a job and be somebody.

Yeah, it really is. Call me heartless, but I see things in black and white. You're either a 0 or a 1 when it comes to each and every quality or ability. And the onus is completely on the person to change their 0 to a 1 or vice versa, and rarely is it difficult. You have to set aside feelings, convenience, luxuries and comfortability when it comes to how you're gonna pay your bills next week.
30 min and not even a satirical answer, I guess that about sums it up.
 you missed the entire point, you only had to look out for yourself. If you have a family, lets say you're about 35 with two kids 7 and 9, where are you just going to pick up and move to? Unemployment wouldn't exist if it was so easy to get a job. 
 I pay myself to go to a private college $56,000 a year, I dont ask anyone for anything, besides the government who provides me with only about $10,000. It is very hard to pay for school.
 You dont know what school is like for everybody either. Im sure you had parents or something when you were elementary,middle, or high school. I've met people whose parent(s) did just up and move and left them to take care of themselves and siblings around the age of 15. Which isnt easy, some cases work out some don't, w/e that's life. 
**It's never heartless to see things in black and white. I see everything how it is.** but i know i must be aware of all situations if im going to see it in black and white and not my own experiences and assume everyone is the off to the same start.
Why did you ask non-Obama voters why people are voting for Obama? Asking here is maybe one step above asking Fox.

Were you born to a homeless family? Did you have to go to work at 14?
How about voting for Obama because his plans are more likely to balance the budget than Romney's? If you are fiscally conservative Romney/Ryan should scare the hell out of you.

As for gay marriage and abortion and such I don't think that Obama can magically change things, I do think that he has presidential power and influence and so can strongly affect things. 

And it makes sense to ask liberals why they are voting for someone.

He was not "highly" against gay marriage and he has not done much of anything on marijuana. No, that is not why I am voting for him. 

But if you are concerned about people doing things for votes please tell me which of the many Romney positions on abortion you favor? Or the variety of positions he has taken regarding Afghanistan or Iraq? Or the GM bailout. Or the individual mandate. Or government stimulus? Romney has done nothing about flip with almost every speech looking for votes.

No, I was raised sheltered and thrown out at 18 to fend for myself with no life skills. It doesn't take much to get ahead of you drop your sense of entitlement and take the tasks you can get for money. You'd be surprised how many lawns that need mowed and houses that need cleaned. 

&gt;issued an executive order to make them citizens

Sorry, but he did not such thing. Not at all. He told the relevant departments that they should prioritize their resources to deport undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes. And that they should prioritize helping those who were taken here as children. He did not make them citizens. You are just simply flat out wrong about this.

&gt;I think Obama won in 2008 not so much because of his policies, but because he was a black candidate that had a real chance - so a lot of people voted him in just on the novelty that he'd be the first black president.

Actually multiple studies have shown that Obama lost about 5% of the vote due to racism. 







You're about to meet another person whose parents just up and left, and I agree wholeheartedly with matchboxx on this one. Its really not hard to feed yourself unless you're a lazy ass. Don't want the onus of feeding kids? Don't have them. You choose your path, from the day you're born to the day you die, and no matter what you can choose a path that doesn't make you reliant on handouts from the State. Furthermore, as someone who not only supported himself, but actually lived well off of minimum wage, its all about what you can trim that you don't need. I overpaid my bills, ate out frequently, and even fueled a technology addiction on $8.75/hour. I have a family member who struggles on 3 times that, but its because she blows her money on a G6 and booze, and expects daddy to bail her out. Tldr you don't need assistance, you need to learn you're not entitled to luxury. 
&gt;I think my take is less biased than yours

Is like saying

&gt;I think I killed my victim less brutally than you did yours

Why not try being unbiased instead. 
You're right, finding another way to let illegal immigrants stay is so much different/better. And don't just deport the criminals. Deport all of the ones not legitimately applying for visas or citizenship. Law is the law. No exceptions. 
&gt;You're right, finding another way to let illegal immigrants stay is so much different/better.

You were just plain wrong. Citizenship does matter. Your false claim was that they were going to vote for Obama, that was flat out clearly utterly wrong. 

&gt; And don't just deport the criminals. Deport all of the ones not legitimately applying for visas or citizenship. Law is the law. No exceptions.

Do you feel this about all laws? That every act of jaywalking should be prosecuted? That every tax error should be treated as a felony? No prosecutorial discretion at all? 


&gt; dont want kids dont have them.

not that simple

&gt; reliant on handouts from the State

my point is; no one should rely on anyone for anything. But assistance is needed
&gt;  I overpaid my bills, ate out frequently, and even fueled a technology addiction on $8.75/hour

Is high for minimal wage through out our great country. 7.25 here and i know people who can work with that, and i know some who cant. no matter what they cut. debt a huge fucker of people so is being laid off.  but im not saying you should rely on the government to bail you out, i believe there are people who need help, some more than others, and it is the governments duty to make sure the country and it's citizens are ok, not support their life. Our country should work as a team in order to be the super power we claim. like the New England Patriots lol
&gt;Your false claim was that they were going to vote for Obama, that was flat out clearly utterly wrong.

It was widely publicized that Obama pushed for their allowance to stay in this country. We can dance the dance of not having any official documentation or statistics to show that these new Latin Americans will vote Obama since the liberals love doing that ("Well where do you see that?") It's called common sense. Obama pushed to let them stay. They'll vote for Obama as a thanks. Simple as that.

&gt;Do you feel this about all laws?

Ohhh you have NO idea. Absolutely. I had my college dean put on unpaid administrative leave for not appropriately addressing underage drinking in the dorms (this is my holy grail as she had the gall to say I broke the law by recording her conversation with me, and I stunned the police with an excerpt from my state's code that allowed it); I've called the police on friends I know are having parties with pot, or underage alcohol or tobacco; I don't speed and call in the plates of drivers that do; I don't pirate copyrighted media; I've called campus security on people who park in the Bus Lane even if it's only for a few minutes; and since you brought it up, I don't jaywalk. (People actually joke with me on campus ["we'll meet you there next week," etc.] because I walk up the sidewalk, to the crosswalk and over, then back down, even when the doors of the opposing buildings match up across the street where there is no crosswalk.)

The list can go on and on, but yes, I'm a firm believer in state and federal law and adhere to them strictly and do my diligence to have those who do not obey said laws penalized. You can call me a narc or whatever-you-please, but the laws aren't there to be broken, they are there to govern. Period.
&gt;not that simple

keep your dick out of people, it doesnt get much more simple.

&gt;assistance is needed

but no one should rely on anyone for anything? you're contradicting yourself.

&gt;high for minimum wage

I've also lived on $7.25 just as comfortably, I just adjusted to fit. Its really not that expensive to live, people just have this set of things they think they need. You can pay rent, electric, cellular, and internet bills on 1 paycheck full time at minimum wage, and you've got another one in the mail to piss away on food and luxuries.
Yeah, do tell me how it's "not that simple." You neglected to elaborate as to just how it isn't. If you aren't financially stable, don't have a child. It'd be irresponsible to do so since you can't afford to care for it. Tying in with this, only sleep with people you're prepared to have a child with. No one said sex is for fun, people just grew accustom to that. If you're not prepared for the consequences if your contraceptives don't work - or if you're just a drunk fuck idiot who had a one night stand with someone at a club and forgot your pill - then don't do those things that put you in that position. I'm abstinent and you know how many illegitimate children I have? Zero.

I currently make 7.25/hour. I not only have enough to pay for my college tuition, my gas to and from a job that is 40 minutes away, my car payment + insurance, my rent, and my cell phone, but then I have some left over to invest in a Roth IRA so that I'm not sucking on Obama's teat when I'm old and gray. It's called financial preparation, and if you don't have it, then it just sucks to be you. You should have been prepared. It's not our job to help you because you decided to be fiscally irresponsible. Live with the consequences.
You're gonna have to bear with me with these stupid 10 minute limits, I can't reply to all this fast enough.

Guess how much government assistance I receive for my college? Zero. My grades were just below the mark to get public scholarships offered by my state, and when I did my FAFSA they determined my parents were too wealthy to give me financial aid, despite the fact they weren't paying a dime of it. My only college discount is about $1,000 I get from the local Diocese for being Catholic. And I haven't been to church in 3 years, yuk yuk.

&gt;It is very hard to pay for school.

No it's not. I work at Chick-fil-A 20 hours a week. My student account balance is $0.00. [Tell me more about how hard it is to pay down a tuition balance.](http://adventistmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/creepy-wonka.jpg)

&gt;but i know i must be aware of all situations if im going to see it in black and white and not my own experiences and assume everyone is the off to the same start.

We are all off to the same start. Same rights as Americans, same country we live in... I don't see what the difference is here between someone coming from poverty and someone coming from wealth. Only in America can you easily change classes and go from poor to rich (and vice versa if you're irresponsible). I've had like 10 jobs in the past 3 years because there's so many jobs to be had out here that I can recycle them as I get bored. (Haven't been fired from a single one. Just said, this bores me, see ya.) So I grow weary of hearing people scratching at my screen door on Facebook about how there's no jobs out there - they're either too picky and want something with good pay and benefits* or they just don't have qualifications or they suck at interviews (all their fault, and all up to them to change. Not me, not you, not the government.)

*When it comes to feeding your ugly family, you don't get to pick a job. If you've got a MBA and the only job in your town is a chef at Burger King, you fucking take it.

&gt;It was widely publicized that Obama pushed for their allowance to stay in this country. 

Which is not the same thing as citizenship. So you simply were wrong about their voting for Obama.

&gt; We can dance the dance of not having any official documentation or statistics to show that these new Latin Americans will vote Obama since the liberals love doing that

Do you really think that non-citiizens are allowed to vote?

&gt;Ohhh you have NO idea. 

So I assume you want to see Bush and Cheney in jail.


&gt;Which is not the same thing as citizenship. So you simply were wrong about their voting for Obama.

Okay, let's say I was wrong then. They still shouldn't be in this country. You came over here illegally, so get out. Come back when you're ready to do it the right way.

&gt;Do you really think that non-citiizens are allowed to vote?

I really don't think you should be allowed to vote.

&gt;So I assume you want to see Bush and Cheney in jail.

Depends, list me a crime they committed and where it violates a state or federal code and I'll give you a yes or a no. Until then, I don't care to seek out crimes: when they are apparent in front of me, I take action. But I'm not doing research to track down who has done what over their lives. If Bush or Cheney did something illegal and the statute of limitations has not expired, absolutely, throw them before a judge.
&gt;Okay, let's say I was wrong then.

Not let's say. You were wrong. Flat out wrong. 

&gt;They still shouldn't be in this country.

How much more would you increase the budget to deal with all crimes? 100%? 400%? 

&gt;I really don't think you should be allowed to vote.

Because when you talk about law you really mean for others. Got that.

&gt;Until then, I don't care to seek out crimes: when they are apparent in front of me, I take action. 

OK, so what is the specific crime of being here illegally? What federal codes does it violate and what is the specified fine/prison term?



Sec. 215. [8 U.S.C. 1185] 

(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the President, it shall be unlawful- 

(1) for any alien to depart from or enter or attempt to depart from or enter the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe; 

(2) for any person to transport or attempt to transport from or into the United States another person with knowledge or reasonable cause to believe that the departure or entry of such other person is forbidden by this section; 

(3) for any person knowingly to make any false statement in an application for permission to depart from or enter the United States with intent to induce or secure the granting of such permission either for himself or for another; 

(4) for any person knowingly to furnish or attempt to furnish or assist in furnishing to another a permit or evidence of permission to depart or enter not issued and designed for such other person's use; 

(5) for any person knowingly to use or attempt to use any permit or evidence of permission to depart or enter not issued and designed for his use; 

(6) for any person to forge, counterfeit, mutilate, or alter, or cause or procure to be forged, counterfeited, mutilated, or altered, any permit or evidence of permission to depart from or enter the United States; 

(7) for any person knowingly to use or attempt to use or furnish to another for use any false, forged, counterfeited, mutilated, or altered permit, or evidence of permission, or any permit or evidence of permission which, though originally valid, has become or been made void or invalid.

&gt;Not let's say. You were wrong. Flat out wrong.

Nope.

&gt;How much more would you increase the budget to deal with all crimes? 

Eleventy million percent. Crime should be our first and foremost priority to weed out people who simply don't want to follow our rules - and we're a society with some of the fewest rules in the world, unlike Saudi Arabia where the women aren't even allowed to drive.

&gt;Because when you talk about law you really mean for others. Got that.

You misunderstand. I don't THINK you should be allowed to vote, because you're a repetitive moron who can only go "hur dur, you're wrong, flat wrong," as if that automatically makes your position correct, which, to quote you, *it simply flat out is not does not nanny honey boo boo.* As much of a liberal, mentally challenged asshole I think you are, if it came down to it, I'd fight for your right to vote in court. Even if you are a bottom-feeding loser.

&gt;OK, so what is the specific crime of being here illegally? What federal codes does it violate and what is the specified fine/prison term?

8 U.S.C. § 1325. Improper entry by alien, and it appears to carry fines and up to 6 months the first time you do it, and up to 18 months thereafter. That was a dumb question, I don't know why you asked me for something available in public records.
&gt; Nope.

Yep. Obama did not make anyone citizens and they can't vote  for him. You were wrong. 
If there are so many jobs, why is unemployment does unemployment exist? Those who want to work, can not get jobs b/c they are too picky or suck at interviews. Yeah im sure that the case for everyone. 40 hours a week on 10 bucks a hour, still wouldnt cover most tuition. you did it by yourself i doubt it.

&gt;We are all off to the same start.

I doubt it, some people can get better jobs based on where and who raised them at an earlier age, giving them a head start in the work force. everyone's  parents end at different places and we pick up from where ever they leave us. No one is off to the same start. Sure you can change classes, just as in nascar. Maybe if you explored america you'll see different starts or you dont have to b/c its not a requirement of anything and i really dont care. I digress and have to go to class soon. This was fun, I guess we just disagree. Have a good day sir. 
No, I was not.

EDIT: Good job ignoring the rest of the thread just so you can say what you've said for the past 8 posts. You do realize that just saying someone else is wrong, does not make your post right, correct?
&gt;If there are so many jobs, why is unemployment does unemployment exist?

Because people are unwilling to take these measures I'm prescribing. They won't move, or they get picky and don't want to work at Burger King because they have a Master's Degree. Guess what, they just have to get over it. Unemployment may also exist because we live in a society were education is no longer important and is instead replaced by alcohol, drugs, Honey Boo Boo or more "fun" things in the eyes of our idiotic youth/sometimes adults. As such, we create unhireable people who spent their high school or college years drinking themselves into a stupor and then expect a handout because no one will hire them because they didn't buckle down and find an internship, or plan their lives. They fucked up. And they have to deal with those consequences now. And until this society learns personal responsibility, we'll keep breeding those same dumbasses because every day there's more freshmen entering college just to party.

&gt;where

I'm sorry, are there nails in their feet that they're locked to the ground? This country is 4,000 miles wide. You can change the "where" at any time. Drive, take a bus, take a train, or walk. I don't care. But if you were born in Brooklyn there isn't a single thing in this universe that says you have to stay in Brooklyn other than your own unwillingness to change or personal decision to stay rooted.

&gt;and who

Elaborate on this, please. If the "who" is a low-income parent who tried to make ends meet but just wasn't too successful, that's not an excuse. You can be way more successful. Your ancestors' household income is not a ceiling for your own income, if anything it's a threshold to beat, like a high score in Pac-Man if you will. If the "who" is just a shitty parent who didn't give two shits about their kid, then this is the parent's fault, and this is why I think CPS should make rounds at *all* homes at random. Honestly, if it were up to me, there'd be an application process before you were permitted to attempt conception, but the liberals get all fussy about that too.

&gt;Sure you can change classes, just as in nascar.

I may be from West Virginia but I don't understand that Dale Earnhardt Mazda Transmission shit. Try another metaphor.

&gt;Maybe if you explored america you'll see different starts

I've visited all of the 48 contiguous states at least once, and I've been in low-income and high-income neighborhoods. I also defer back to the top where I've primarily lived in West Virginia, one of the poorest, uneducated states in the union; and I still don't have sympathy for these people, because it's not that the educational system isn't there to feed them, even in a redneck state you'd think only offers classes on deer huntin' and chewin' tobacky I barely graduated with a 3.0 - it's that they'd rather spend their time drinking, smoking weed, getting in trouble and/or "livin' the life" and then they end up left behind. I know life's short and you want to spend it having fun, but if you don't balance that with getting educated or finding a good job...you only have yourself to blame. I *did* my part. So tell me why money is taken out of *my* paycheck to support those people.
Your initial point was flat out wrong and there is no point in follow some attempt to deny it. Obama did not make illegals citizens and so they are not voting for him. 
And I really don't see why you're still hung up on that since you are wrong as well, and seem to have completely ignored the responses to your other idiot questions such as the text of the law you so steadfastly demanded. If you're not going to maintain an intelligent discussion, I have a *job* to attend to, so please, drink and drive, so that I don't have to deal with you *existing* anymore.
And as a voter formerly on the fence, neither am I thanks to the ignorance of his voters. Good job bro, you just invalidated your own vote. 
Sure. You decided based on me. 
Nascar metaphor is to say sure you can move to first, but you may start @ 32. Saying that everyone isnt off to the same start and some have to work harder to the same place. Nothing wrong with that either. You missed the point, yes you can do better than your shitty parents and you are expected too but your parents are responsible for your start in life. Money is taken out of your check to support everyone. Or they would die (extreme) death looks bad on a country. 
No everywhere the education systems isnt feeding children, so kids have to worry about feeding there family instead of school growing up, so they prob drop out at 16 and a job placing the future on their 8 years old bro who they want to do well in school get a job blah blah other bullshit. It's upsetting that you believe all of the people who are unemployed are that way b/c they are picky or honey boo boo (idk wtf that is btw)
&gt;Nascar metaphor is to say sure you can move to first, but you may start @ 32. Saying that everyone isnt off to the same start and some have to work harder to the same place.

Okay, I think I may have misunderstood your argument here then. What you're getting at is for example, Tagg Romney, had wealth growing up and his father pushed him through school which is why he owns a big equity firm now; whereas someone born in the South Bronx to a poor single mother would have to work their ass off to have a chance at that same opportunity. I'll give you that. But that doesn't mean it's unattainable, and it doesn't mean the government has a responsibility to help lift you up...you either have the potential to put in that hard work, or you don't. Some people can't do it, and it just sucks to be them, but someone has to deliver the pizzas.

&gt;Money is taken out of your check to support everyone.

Let me be a little more open here - since I tend to argue a fierce position and then people think I don't have a soul: I have no problem a portion of my money going to some single mother who just got left by her husband (or escaped an abusive marriage), etc. has to feed her kids, can't find work, truly disadvantaged. She still has options, but she could use some temporary aid. She deserves it - but only if she truly needs it and isn't pissing her other money away on luxuries like a big TV or what-have-you. If a person like that came up to me with that story I'd cut them a check myself. But I am *not* OK with the government deciding where that money goes for me...because they suck at choosing. They give it to the lazy, picky, drug addicts because the gov't workers have a "well it's not my money" attitude (even though it partially is) or they just don't care....the system is terribly disorganized and has strayed far from it's original purpose when it was instantiated in the Depression. It needs a complete reboot - and I think that's only achievable by getting rid of it all and starting over. Maybe.

On that note, also, I just had this discussion via Facebook - in WV, we have a PROMISE scholarship. Total full ride to your choice of a public, in-state college, all you gotta do is get a 3.0 average in high school - even if you go to a private/home school. Right now, that's just money we piss away on a lot of kids who just drink themselves to death at WVU, and the select few who do something good with it. Our previous governor proposed that in exchange for the full ride, you work in the state for 5 years to contribute to our growth, OR you paid it back at like a 0.4% interest rate. Reasonable, not a bad deal, and encouraged you to actually use the funding to do something good with your life. Unfortunately, it was mercilessly shot down by the liberals; and he was a Democrat.

Why can't we do that with welfare benefits? Once you get a good job, pay us back. Not just with the shitty $40 withholding they'll take out of your paycheck each week, but pay back the amount we gave you, over time, with low or no interest. That way, you'll be less inclined to piss it away while we're giving it to you. I also think the government should do random audits of people's homes who are on welfare, make sure they're not wasting the aid. But our government is far too incompetent to do this.

I'd also like to know why we don't do drug tests for aid. That was shot down by the liberals too. I would be way, way more optimistic about government aid if there were more insurance policies like that to make sure losers aren't just wasting the money.

&gt;It's upsetting that you believe all of the people who are unemployed are that way b/c they are picky

Democrats are far too optimistic. They all seem to think everyone has good in their heart, the will to do their part, and genuinely needs aid in their time of need....it just isn't that way. The majority of people are greedy, lazy losers, who waste it. And just like with anything, it ruins it for everybody - including the people that may *actually* need it.

&gt;or honey boo boo (idk wtf that is btw)

[It's a reality series of people who contribute to America's wealth of social etiquette.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11T59SdqguQ)
&gt; Am I missing something? I feel that people who are going to vote for Obama are doing so because they believe health care, free money, free food, and unemployment are owed to them in a way. 

Yeah, you're missing a whole lot.  Most notably, the fact that everyone is different and has different motivations.  Some people voting for Obama may believe some of those things (some may believe all of them) -- but lumping them all together and thinking you know "why they're voting for Obama" is just silly.  

One might as well talk about what "the blacks think" or "what the Spanish think" or "what the blind think."  I believe when we try to make blanket generalizations like that we're simply being ignorant and mentally lazy.

So, speaking strictly for myself: I'm voting for Obama not as much to support him, but because the I believe other choice is much, much worse for America and me personally.  While I agree with a lot of what Obama has done, I do find LOTS of fault with him, and strongly disagree with him on a whole slew of issues.  That said, I have many more strong disagreements with Romney and Ryan.  And I don't trust them at all.  At least with Obama you know what you're going to get (like it or not).

Disclosure: I'm an exec in Silicon Valley.
Much respect to you for what you've accomplished, and I really agree with the "fix your life!" sentiment.  I got my first job at 14 and made my own way in the world.

And I'm smart enough to realize that I'm not a dirt-poor minority in the south, nor a young single mother, nor a 60-something baby boomer who lost her job and hasn't been able to find gainful employment since the crash.  I've been blessed - and lucky.  Many are not nearly so fortunate and do not have realistic opportunities, given their current circumstances, to do what I had done.  That doesn't mean they should receive endless handouts[1] - but it nor does it mean it should be "all on them"

I'm also not so deluded by my own success to believe that I'd be in similar great shape if I had traded spots with another person with different challenges earlier in my life.

Put simply: it just ain't that simple.

[1] that doesn't even happen anymore, but whatever.
&gt;Dirt-poor minority in the south

they still get jobs if they want them, I live down here. The dirt poor ones are dirt poor because they smoke rocks and live off the state like fucking leeches.

&gt;young single mother

should have kept her fucking legs shut. Its not hard to not have a baby, just don't fuck people.

&gt;60-something baby boomer

should have retirement. I'm 20 and I'm already starting to save for it

TLDR there's still no excuse. keep trying.
(edit: formatting)
Sorry, but it really is "that simple." Let's look at the examples you provided:

**Dirt-poor minority in the south:**  What's stopping them from getting educated and getting a good job? Public education is free and has to meet certain standards or the state and federal governments *do* take action. As for college, student loans are readily available. So are scholarships and grants. Student loans are not that bad and have some of the lowest interest rates in the financial industry - they just get a bad rap because people seem to have forgotten during their 4 years of school they spent partying that this was all costing around $50,000 and now that they graduated and have no skills, it's hitting them like a truck. (Or even if they weren't partying, it's still easy to forget when someone else is paying the bill that you're gonna eventually owe it back.) Student loans also get a bad rap because they *will* get their money; they are the only loan that the government willingly allows the lender to levy your paycheck for payments and the only loan that you cannot default on or declare bankruptcy to escape. **TL;DR student loans aren't that bad and they always get their money so they'll approve a dog for one if you co-sign for it**

**Young single mother:** Why is she young and with a kid? Maybe she shouldn't have fucked some guy she wasn't married to, or one that was going to leave her high-and-dry; obviously there are exceptions to this, but when you say "young single mother" to me, I think of someone who got pregnant in high school, and sorry, but if you were too stupid to know any better, that's simply your fuckin' fault. As a social conservative I also have to be grateful that she kept the child rather than mercilessly aborting him/her, and is trying to get by, or may have recently been laid off; in those cases, I have no problem with welfare going to that. But the system is not rigorous enough to ensure the money only goes to legitimate causes. There are far more illegitimate uses of welfare money than legitimate uses of it in this country today. And it is fiscally irresponsible to employ a policy of "let 20 guilty run free rather than 1 innocent be imprisoned" and keep the system the way it is so that the deserving people still get their aid but as such, so do the abusers. That's a downhill slope. **TL;DR if you were 16 and pregnant that's your own damn fault, but if you are truly just out of bad luck and your man ran out on you and you can't find work, fine, but the system is too fucked up to ensure only good people like that get the aid**

**60-something baby boomer:** I'm not gonna give any rope on this one, sorry. If you're 60 years old, you should have been smart enough to be having a savings built up beneath you loooong ago, whether for retirement, being laid off, or in case of a natural disaster. It's a personal insurance policy. I haven't even graduated college yet and I have [5 $10,000 CD accounts that I can access in an emergency without penalty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificates_of_deposit) as well as a [Roth IRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth_IRA) for retirement. It's not that complicated. That way when something happens, like your car needing a HUGE repair, or an unexpected bill comes along or something...you have money laying around to put into it. And there's no minimum on these things by the way. It'll take me 10 more paragraphs to tell you why my CDs are broken up into $10k increments, but you can open a CD with $50 if you want. So your income has no bearing on if you are able to start saving. **TL;DR if you're 60 years old and you don't have savings for retirement or being laid off, then you're really fucking dumb and you made your own bed, now lie in it.**

There's no excuses. Also, I have 2 jobs. Two! So there is no excuse why people out there can't even find *one.* And one of these two jobs by the way is my business that I own; and I have openings! I need sales people for my store. No prior experience necessary (obviously I'd prefer it, but point is, I sell audio equipment, and I can train people to learn what this stuff does. You don't have to know the ins and outs of the industry to apply.) I've run ads about it. And no one is biting. I've received one application and that person later decided they didn't feel like doing the work that was necessary for the job. So...do tell me how there's no jobs out there for people, because I've got openings for jobs that don't even necessarily require a high school diploma and no one's interested.
Your thoughts are indicative of hivemind ideas. 

&gt;Obama stated that small business owners didn't create their business themselves

This is taken straight from the attack ads that are patently misleading. He didn't ever say that or imply that, he was clearly referring to infrastructure, but the ad cherry picked.

The speech was suggesting that business owners didn't create the roads etc., Obama didn't create the roads etc., but the contract between people and government (taxes to pay for government services) did. 

And while I might agree with your idea about how we have a fair chance, day to day, that's idealistic, not realistic. 

For my personal views and opinions, I have a lot in common with the right as far as personal responsibility, restraint, self-support etc. but the fact is that reality doesn't work that way. You're only viewing things through your ideal scope, which feels justified because it works for you, but being a useful part of society requires an understanding of "cultural relativism" which is basically being able to think about walking in someone else's shoes .

If the poor get poorer, they don't disappear. Things get worse for everyone. Homeless numbers go up, people don't go to the hospital until it's an emergency which strains the hospital  and its costs, and in a macro-view, revolutions/rioting happen when the gap between upper and lower classes is too great.

In response to your actual question there, yes, you are missing a whole lot of things, mainly the difference between an ideal world and the real world.
lol I came here for laughs. I was not disappointed.

Oh republicans..never change.
Lol, I also came here for laughs. You realise that just because someone doesn't have a job that doesn't mean that they don't want to work? 
No one was denied help.  Not a single general or commander on the ground says this.  They were given all the help that was available, unfortunately there was very little in the way of help stationed there (whether that place should've even been available as an embassy is a totally different discussion).  They had to request teams from the states and from out of italy, and by the time those teams arrived the evac had already been completed.

This is such a non-story.  Move on to shit that matters please.  Like gitmo or NDAA.

After going back and forth between /r/Republicans and /r/Democrats, I have to say you are all in utter blinders to reality. 
There is really no hope for the way people will remember Bush. Unless corrupt war criminal suddenly becomes a virtuous title.
&gt;but don't we get a fair chance to make something of ourselves every day?

You are missing the fact that people come from vastly different backgrounds and circumstances. Think of two different kids in real life scenarios: a minority, growing up in a poor place, who's parents don't have jobs and who goes to a terrible school; and a kid who's parents are rich, have stable jobs and who goes to a great school. The first kid is going to have tons of disadvantages throughout his life such as poor diet, moving often, having to work, getting poor education, being discriminated against, etc. The second kis is going to have a great life at home, be fed good food, be put in the best educational circumstances, and have connections to high paying jobs. 

Saying that everyone has the same chance at being successful is a gross over simplification.      
Hahahaha. "our election."

Because they were trying not to compromise CIA Operations that were still in the area. Also, didnt the compound tweet a repudiation of that video as well? That's what Romney was talking about the day it happened. So there was probably genuine confusion too.
At least we still live in the greatest country on Earth.
Seriously, where the hell are the Republicans in this subreddit? I'm going home. 
WHAT THE HELL **HAPPENED**?! GODDAMMIT, IT'S A **CONSPIRACY**!!
Most probably think that a republican subreddit is not allowed on reddit. Sigh.  
Where were you when Busj and Cheney and the whole Republican team stood by and did nothing and allowed 3000 American deaths on 9/11 and then compounded their error by attacking the wrong country based on lies causing 4000 more American deaths and hundreds of thousands of more American injuries and millions of Iraqi injuries and deaths? Did you call for Bush's impeachment and prosecution?

You ignorant coward. What happened in Benghazi was a mistake sure, but not 1/1000th the mistake that Bush made. 

If you can't properly weight events and assign blame and responsibility then just shut up.
Once more you fucking dirty shit Republicans are doing nothing but spreading lies. You people are all genuine paranoid psychopaths, you have lost all touch with reality.
Even they recognize the greatness of Obama's re-election.
This dude is like the Clarence Thomas of Hispanics.
You're clearly intelligent.  Again, congratulations on your successes.  

You also have a lot of quick answers to (very) complex problems.  TL;DR: it's exceptionally easy to shrug and say "you're fucking dumb."  

In my experience it just ain't that simple.

I must admit: I thought similarly to you, back in my 20's (am a 40-something now).  Honestly, I was an arrogant little fucker back in college, and most of the answers to the worlds' problems were apparent to me.  With a couple decades in the world I realize (with no small measure of embarrassment) how little I really knew then and how simplistic my understanding of the dynamics of the world were.

Hell, I still feel that way about the 35-year old version of myself.  I guess it's all part of getting old.

Good luck finding some folks to fill your open reqs for your business.  As you probably know, hiring is the hardest thing we managers do.
Your ability to (viciously) generalize and make assumptions is impressive.

So was mine, when I was 20.

The winning statistics behind this election don't reveal a strategy behind Obamas win. Nate's numbers didn't have a side, they were just numbers. They were a repercussion of decisions that had already been made by candidates. They could have been useful as far as, say, Romney knowing he had an improbable chance of winning a month ago and thus changed things up... But that wasn't the purpose of the statistical methods used in moneyball.

The 9/11 conspiracy has been debunked multiple times.  Take off your tin foil hat and go outside.
Your a prime example of the cry baby democrat!  Thanks for this comment, I'm going to use this to show others how arrogant and ignorant you people really are
The whole Benghazi "scandal" was created by FOX news. You are a moron if you believe anything said by Republicans. You filthy bastards are on the wrong side of every issue. If it involves impoverishing or humiliating people or taking away their rights, ignorance, torture, war, sickness, death, destruction of the environment, you sick moron bastards will be in favour of it. Just fuck you and all your filthy kind. Do you ever wonder why the rest of the civilized world favours Democrats over Republicans 4 to 1??? And they are better educated than you too.

Crossroads is Karl Rove's propaganda machine, you fucking idiot.
It is a fact that Bush and his entire moron government did nothing when they were warned months in advance. Fact. I'm not alluding to any conspiracy. 9/11 was a mountain compared to the molehill of Benghazi and you are too brainwashed and ignorant to know the difference. Fuck off and die.
Oh man this is hilarious.  please keep talking
That is what someone says who is trying to save face when he hasn't the wit, intelligence or knowledge to counter what he has been told.

Witless asshole.
I left the GOP for this and many other reasons; Obama has been more of a conservative than anything else. I truly enjoyed Obama's win and I hope the GOP will fix what is broke in order to provide and alternative to the DEMS when they screw things up. 
This. Is. Gold.
Please keep talking, me and my buddies are getting a good laugh out of this
[deleted]
I disagree. Maybe our vision of conservative is a little different. The power of the president does not lie in the Constitution, it lies in his ability to compromise. Rmoney would have been fantastic for 1% of the country; Obama represents a moderate, slightly right leaning, majority of the country. Only three other presidents have won both election and re-election with more than 50% of the vote; Reagan, FDR, and Eisenhower are now in good company. 
[deleted]
We'll disagree for now, that's ok. I would like to know if you thought the election was close or did you believe the polls? Just curious. 
[deleted]
The Obama machine came to see  me and my daughter during the first week of October. During the early voting season they were knocking on doors and getting groups of people to go vote together, in convoys. Afterwards there was cake and punch! They had their shizzle together. I was impressed because I had thought the ground game was a thing of the past, guess I was wrong. I don't think we need a businessman in the Oval office, not one who seemed so indifferent to the troubles faced by the commoners. I dunno, I think we'll all be fine in the long run.
Why did you stop?  Keep talking please
I'm not wasting any more time on a moron.

And all Republicans are morons. And just plain nasty people besides.
Hahahahaha oh man your funny!

If Republicans are morons, what are democrats?

Sorry I don't believe the government should give people free things so those people can be as last as they want 
"you're" = you are.

And you are, not surprisingly, illiterate.

Did you see the post where 10 out of the 10 best educated states voted Democrat and 9 out of 10 of the worst educated states voted Republican?

You really ought to read your bible where Jesus tells you that if you want to get into heaven you have to give away all your worldly possessions and devote your life to the poor, old and sick.

*shrug* no skin off my nose if you burn in hell for eternity, I'm an atheist.
How do you know if someone is an atheist?  Just wait, they'll tell you.

Yea, that was debunked a long time ago buddy.
And my point was, Republicans have done more good for this world than any Democrat. We're not leeches of society, we are contributes of society.
Just fuck of. I know everything there is to know about you already: You are ignorant, illiterate and nasty.
[You can't argue with Facts](http://www.happyplace.com/19076/election-infographic-shows-most-educated-states-voted-for-obama)

You can research which states have the least educated population and which states voted which way. Also - red states have the most obese people, the most divorce and teen pregnancies and abortions, the most religion, the most crime, the lowest wages, the least intelligence. And they are subsidized by taxes paid by blue states. Facts.

Well yes, of course you can, you are an ignorant Republican who believes in an invisible sky friend who created the universe 10,000 years ago.

"we are contributes of society" LOL, what an idiot.
Fuck of???  FUCK OF???
lol kid, not everybody is perfect.  You just made a spelling error, that doesn't make you illiterate however.

You actually have no idea who I am.  You probably wouldn't act the same way if I told you I was in the Army.

I'm kinda glad you're too young to vote.  Your just so angry
[deleted]
There is that "your" again when you mean "you're". 

I can believe you were in the army. Do you know who joins the fucking army? Morons who flunk out of high school and aren't capable of anything more than serving up fries in McDonalds. So they send you overseas to do the killing for the rich people.

And I'm 53 years old, sonny. I've been dealing with shit like you all my life.
When your only source of news is /r/politics your ganna have a bad time.

I like how you totally disregarded everything I just told you and kept ranting.  You  spend too much time circle jerking in /r/politics.

Seriously though, I hope you don't plan to have a future in politics.  You're just so angry and negative and ranting.  You're a classic liberal; a kicking, screaming, cry baby.  Instead of debating topics, you tell everyone who disagrees with you how stupid they are.  It's pathetic.

And again, you're too young to vote so why do you care so much?
[deleted]
I haven't seen you actually respond to any of the points I have made. This post of yours is typical.

Hey jerk wad - I'm not even American. Do you realize just how sick the way your country fetishizes the military looks to the sane and civilized parts of the world?

Sorry but everything your military has done since WW2 has been to protect US corporate interests. You have been used. You have only done harm in the world. Ask the million or so dead Iraqis.
And I just know that you get your news from FOX - the propaganda arm of your great political party. All lies all the time to keep the ignorant voting against their best interests.
And another thing you dumb fuck - which party does a better job of looking after veterans??? It certainly isn't the Republicans. Across the board you are just wrong and ignorant about everything and you support the very people who are destroying your country - Republicans.
Wait a second, your not even American?  May I ask what you are, and h your so in love with American politics?
Anyway, quit bothering me.

[Here is one of your own kind to talk to](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/104lx8/republican_rehab_a_soldier_learns_a_hard_lesson/). Ex military and ex Republican. Maybe he can talk some sense into you.
No, I want to know what country you're from and why you're so interested in American politics
I hope Rand is the next guy that's getting groomed. I'm a disenfranchised Republican that's voted Dem down the line, in many cases, simply because of how crazy the right has been since the Bush years. I'm more of a liberal Republican, which has no place in today's party.

However, I love Rand. He's obviously not my ideal candidate, as I don't adhere to a lot of his Libertarian philosophies. I think he's genuine in what he says, put's the country first, and is a critical thinker educated on the subjects. I would vote for the guy in a heartbeat. 

On a side note, you know what I hate? Soon as a politician says they are all for legalizing marijuana, it becomes a part of their identity. I hate that, as it distracts from everything else about the candidate and becomes one of their defining features. It also tends to bring on board the hippies who can cloud the candidates image. Uggg... I hate it.
If these small changes it would def make the republican party more attractive.

The author recounts a childhood memory of the ugliness of the Jim Crow system when she for the first time noticed how African Americans were dehumanized in the euphemistically titled “Separate but Equal” policies of the old South and compares it to post election GOP behavior.
also, i don't think smothering this child is going to help his image.

I don't think that the election was a crushing defeat for Republicans at all.  Nearly every state showed huge rightward movement from 2008.  The margin in each swing state was less than 2%.  Honestly, even though they lost, I think that the results should be pretty reassuring for Republicans.
What has this article to do with /r/republicans?
Stop posting this shit in republicans or conservatives.. so fucking dumb.
this is an important case regarding gun control and gun safety. maybe if you actually knew something about politics and this case, you would understand the importance of this new light being shed. you are just as ignorant as the liberals, it is people like you who bring a bad name to republicans.

Mitt Romney's nomination created the GOP leadership vacuum, Brent!
Yes, sir "PoliticalModerate" that's exactly what we need, more highly conservative, religious, non-negotiating Tea-Party members in the Republican party. That will surely solve the problems of the parties issue of being divisive, exclusive, and unwilling to compromise. 

These Republicans see it as a war that is being fought in DC, not running a country. They look at the left as the enemy, and not just people with differing philosophy. We need these very people out of public office. 

Sorry, but this is why so many Republicans are saying, "I didn't leave the Republican party, the Republican party left me." We need it to be okay again to be a moderate or liberal Republican again. Until then, fuck 'em.

Also, before he died of cancer, he was a mentally unstable amputee incapable of pushing a lawnmower or hitting the accelerator of a riding one.

*Steps on soapbox*
By no intent of your own you've proved why liberal and/or social policies inevitably fail. Everyone can be a victim if they word it the right way, in any circumstance. 
I was hit by a car on my bike (fault of the car running a light). I was hurt. I could go to court and/or claim some sort of trauma that inevitably could land me on disability. Instead I asked for the guy to pay to fix my bike and go on with my life. 
History repeats itself. The grandiose hunky-dory policies make perfect sense...until you're the one paying for it. 
Go to Greece, please. They have everything you want and everything you deserve. Which is sad considering the birthplace of democracy has been completely manhandled by idiots who don't understand anything except feelings.
One of the great travesties about liberals is they don't think, they feel.
As a conservative I believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfill their own potential.
I'm sick and tired of hearing that "we're all equal." We're all individuals we're not all the same and we never have be. We should encourage each other to achieve, to instill the aspiration of success to the next generation based off of individuality, hard work and true merit. Not this, "my life was harder than yours" BS.
*Steps off soapbox*
wow seriously leave it to the liberals to automatically assume the homeless man is A disabled, and somehow through tons of government programs, still remains homeless as no choice of his own, yeah, right. 
I've been homeless. You're wrong
It was a joke?
Ah yes, hiding behind irony and satire. Both of which are an immediate self-defense mode. Hiding behind them each allows a person to dodge responsibility for his or her choices, actions and otherwise. It has the left living in a state of vacuity and vapidity as a collective that they're too blind to even realize.
You suffer ideological blindness
Your ignorance is astounding. It is I that am blind as we watch liberal policies take their course in Europe. Greece 165% debt/GDP, Italy 120%, Portugal 109%, Ireland 108%,  Belgium 98%, France 89%, Spain 76%. Arguing with idiots...it's a waste of time. You're a waste of time.

If you want the honest truth I am a republican who is extremely pissed off and completely disillusioned that Republicans entertain Climate change denial. I know thats a non sequiter but it is the conclusion I have come to about myself after a lot of soul searching
You didn't really argue any case there. Consumer confidence, size and overall buying power is what is keeping the US afloat. None of these graphs shock me - it's are those factors alone that keep us limping along. So again, I see you in a sense proving my point.

Goddamn commies and your downvoting. Get off this subbreddit, liberal f*cks.
unfortunately i am disgusted that the democratic party supports one of the most corrupt bullying extorting enterprises on the planet, "unions" every party has their crazies.  
Both sides accept a certain level of dysfunction within any institution when they believe enough in its function, so political wars have become irrelevant to me. Private control of capital is both functional and dysfunctional, and government is both functional and dysfunctional, both sides are just haggling over percentages. But conservatives need a conservative solution to climate change, because I will not accept liberal attacks on capitalism because of climate change. Pretending Cimate change isnt real exposes deeply flawed thinking amongst the right, pretending there is a dysfunction within science to destabilise its function. Gingrich and Pelosi sat side by side to both ask for people to help with climate change. What happened? Special interest groups leverage economic advantage by politicising uncertainty and Republicans bought into it.
As a liberal, god yes.
All this shows is the innocence of children. Would you really hire some random homeless looking guy to come mow your lawn?
I wonder if the scene would have played out like this if there were no cameras. Remember there was a camera man squatting in front of them both and this is likely a staged in which they posed for the photograph.

&gt; I'm sick and tired of hearing that "we're all equal."

The Declaration of Independence states just that. 

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that **all men are created equal**, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
Unions got you the working conditions you have today, which have slowly declined as unions fell.
so what was in the safe
[deleted]
we no longer need unions, are yous seriously claiming the conditions of workers in america are on the decline? no.  unions are corrupt gangs that extort and limit business in america
this is simply about the rout basics of republicanism, what the hell was that shpeal, people who ignore climate change are ignorant to say the least.  i am socially liberal, economically conservative.  i believe the power should stay with the states and not the federal government. therefore; i am a republican 
People who grew up in the 50's were used to single parent families, owning a house, not having unpaid internships.  Wages have stagnated for a long time now, it definitely is on the decline.  Does it really make sense to say workers banding together to demand fair wages and working conditions is bad for those workers?  Its almost like you've bought into some propaganda put out by those who stand to gain by killing unions.  Do you really want to stand alone against a company that holds your welfare at hand, with the ability to drop you at any time leaving you squandering for a paycheck?
The linking of wanting to prioritize homes for everyone to how about you give up the home you have cause you're so generous is beyond intellectually dishonest, and I see nothing entertaining about the prospect. Homeless people suffer enough, could we not circlejerk on them if we have no will to help them?
It's reassuring that Republicans lost to someone who was *behind* on the generic ballot?
I really want a book full of all these amusing little examples, anecdotes, and fables promoting conservative/Republican values. I grew up listening to them and some even sounded kind of convincing, like the teacher who teaches why "socialism" is bad by having the students share grades until everyone fails.

Yep, I really want an organized tome. But after each little story, someone should take the time to dissect and explain why each one is fallacious, unfactual, or just wrong.
Maybe things work differently on a national scale? Making a political point with this kind of analogy, all other things being equal, makes me assume that I'm being deceived.
and you think a union is necessary for that?
If you dont want to accept bare minimum wages it helps to have a grouping of people for negotiations, then you can determine what the company s profits were and determine what a fair wage is without being laid off.  People rely on a paycheck to live, they dont exactly have the upper hand in negotiations.
I think saying it's a state's rights issue now is too little too late. You first have to go back over thousands of benefits at the federal level that function through marriage. Get all that cleaned up, then we can talk about how it's supposed to work if you get married in California and move to Alabama.
HaHa! You're basically advocating for the removal of the moronic social conservative agenda from the GOP...but social conservatives are the  base of the party. I've watched this foolishness slowly destroy the GOP since the late 70s...you're dreaming if you think they're going to shut the hell up now.  
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.


&gt;On the question of black Republicans like Tim Scott, however, the far left and the mainstream Democratic left are fully in accord. "Modern-day Republicans have deployed blacks to undermine black interests," Reed writes,

Funny thing is that Democrats control inner cities and have been failing black people from coast to coast for decades now. 
this article and much of the broadcast news this week is great republican bashing. What you are not hearing or reading, is that the bill presented to congress was full of pork, only a fraction was actual money for 'hurricane' relief. Dig deeper for the truth. 

I mean pork as in $222 million for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to get returned excise taxes on rum products, or maybe the $70 million going to NASCAR to recover costs for race track repairs.

There is $430 million in the pot for Hollywood producers to expense on productions up to $15 million. How about $59 million for algae growers working on something called "cellulosic biofuel?'
At what point in history did the federal government become a giant insurance policy?
Sorry this just isn't true. All of the provisions you listed were in the fiscal cliff bill. [Here](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr41enr/pdf/BILLS-113hr41enr.pdf) is the full text of the Sandy bill. It is one page long. All of the money goes to flood insurance 

Edit: Linked to the final version of the bill.
i think you are referring to the 'new' bill that was written without the pork and it passed.

http://www.nj.com/south-jersey-voices/index.ssf/2013/01/letter_bloated_hurricane_sandy.html
I am referring to the exact same bill this article is referring to. 67 Republican members of the house voted against the exact bill that I linked to, and that your source discusses.  They voted against the one page bill that was pure Sandy relief and had absolutely no "pork".

Here are the questions.

* Do you support the democrats or the republicans? (easy one)
* What state do you live in?
* What are your opinion on the gun law in your state?
* Do you think there should be made any changes to it?
* Do you like the gun law better in another state? If so which one?
* Do you think there is a connection between the fact that USA have the most "open" gun law and the fact that the USA is country with the most school shootings?
* Do you think there should be armed guards outside of the schools?
* Do you think it would be okay for teacher to have guns in their desk?

I am sorry if there is something you do not understand, english isn`t my first language. If you have any trouble understanding what i have written, please say so and i will try to explain what i mean. 
TIL Republicans are frightened of math.

This explains quite a bit.
&gt;Do you support the democrats or the republicans? (easy one)

Technically, I support neither.  I'm an ardent Libertarian.  That being said, I voted for John Kerry, Bob Barr, and Mitt Romney in their respective elections.  I'm socially liberal, but fiscally conservative.

&gt;What state do you live in?

Tennessee.

&gt;What are your opinion on the gun law in your state?

I think they are too restrictive.  I have a Handgun Carry Permit, but I find no part of the Constitution that allows my state to require that I apply and pay them money to exercise a right.  A poll tax would be illegal, so why is it legal to tax me to exercise my right to bear arms?

 &gt;Do you think there should be made any changes to it?

Yes, I think anyone who is not a felon should be allowed to bear arms without interference from the government.  

&gt;Do you like the gun law better in another state? If so which one?

I would prefer that my state not be a "permit state".  I don't like paying money every 5 years to renew a right I have under the Constitution.

&gt;Do you think there is a connection between the fact that USA have the most "open" gun law and the fact that the USA is country with the most school shootings?

That's an incredibly thorny and loaded question.  It also goes to definitions: Anders Brevik (sp?) attacked a 'school', in that it was a retreat for a political party to train future operatives.  Also, you have to define "most".  I hate to sound clinical, but do you mean body count, frequency, etc.?  It's entirely possible that my country leads by any measure, but I don't think more laws are the answer.  Columbine happened during the 'assault weapons ban', and Newtown is in CT, which has one of the most restrictive gun laws in the country and they (/sarcasm somehow) didn't deter the guy from murdering his mother and taking her guns once he found out she was trying to have him involuntarily committed.

&gt;Do you think there should be armed guards outside of the schools?

No.  They should be inside the schools.  Outside does no good.

&gt;Do you think it would be okay for teacher to have guns in their desk?

Properly trained and secured, absolutely.  Although I would NEVER put it in the desk; it would be a sidearm for the teacher.  Off the top of my head, Google the Perl, Mississippi or Appalachian School of Law shootings, and you will find people who headed off a potential tragedy.
Thanks for the answers i appreciate it, a lot!

What i mean by most are that the USA has the most amount incidents with school shootings. So frequency.
Then my reply would be that I think the sheer number of guns that are available probably has something to do with it, but that genie is already out of the bottle.  The gov't can't go around seizing weapons, so there's nothing you can do about it.  My point about Columbine and Sandy Hook and the relevant laws in effect at the time still stand.  

Personally, I think the #1 way we could cut down on incidents like this is to stop overmedicating our teenagers.  I believe in 20 years or so, we're going to see something like the Thalidomide issues, related to how all the ADHD/antidepressants/whatever affected the developing teenage brain.  It should also be easier to commit people who are mentally ill.  The Sandy Hook shooter was in the process of involuntary committal by his mother, and it's been hinted that when he found that out was when he snapped.
Alright thanks for the answers.
You're quite welcome.  Good luck with your assignment!

i would vote for her and then laugh at this subreddit when you guys bitch about her winning the presidency 
yeah youre right. nevermind that congress past relief 5 days after katrina for bush. 

oh obama is president? in that case, NJ and NY can handle themselves right? after all the homeless and homes and business destroyed and flood protection destroyed, they should be fine.

She's a [compulsive liar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudologia_fantastica)
It's interesting how you automatically assume that republicans won't vote for her without knowing anything about what she will say or who her opponent is.  It's as though you're on a sports team, not deciding who is in control of the greatest nation on earth.  

I don't mean to single you out, and the other side does it too, my point is simply that I just have a little moment of epiphany...  What am I doing choosing "a side", as though that would be of *any* value to me or the nation.  This isn't a sports team, it's my future, and the future of my children.
What is her opponent is a bigger lier?  
All right man, this is the second time I've run into you. There's something you need to know... Proper writing and grammar pay great dividends on reddit and debate in general. Go to school, learn how to read and write and then maybe we'll listen to you.
No such person exists in today's world. ;-)
You've never worked in advertising.
Whitewater.  

Her signature was on the legal papers that defrauded the government of a large chunk of money at their profit.  Her defense was "Oh, I didn't know what I was doing.".  

Either she knew what she was doing, and should be in jail, or she's so incompetent that she didn't know what she was doing, and shouldn't be given responsibilities.  

Everything else after that adds to it, but that's enough for me to say she should never do anything that requires my tax money.  
Non-Republican here. I would imagine that the fact that she's not a Republican is enough of a reason for a lot of registered Republicans not to vote for her. Beyond all of the things she may or may not have done Wouldn't the fact that her political ideology is not the same as many people here result in her not being voted for here?
Benghazi.
For the record I'm not in support of Bush's handling of Katrina, but I appreciate the straw man.
lol
Unfortunately, the only solution is to find a way to make the public aware of the reality of the policies that are being put forth.  

The fact of the matter is that about 20% of our voters don't have a clue as to what they really voted for, what it means or where it leads leads...   An uninformed voter is persuaded by the biggest, even if impossible promise, the most inspiring, but meaningless speech and the most beautiful, but unachievable vision...  The politician gets the vote... the nation gets the shaft! The uninformed electorate is a big part of why our government is not working.   Education and understanding is vital to this nation's future.  http://wp.me/p2EGlL-9N
I think 20% is more than an understatement.  I've been to polls campaigning for state seats and you would not believe what percentage of them pretty much admit they are single issue voters or straight ticket voters (Sometimes ok, if they vote republican ! ;) ).

I think the problem is more so our appearance.  The media tends to like to attack the right side of the isle much more so than the left.  Everything republicans do is considered obstructionism or evil, whilst Obama cannot do wrong.  

Though also, in my honest opinion, I think the republican party should really lighten up on social issues.  I, myself, believe in gay marriage.  Their right, non of my business.  Gay marriage is a large issue for voters ( which it really shouldn't be, if you're deciding vote on social issues, you shouldn't be voting).  

Unfortunately, there also is just the presentation of our party platform the public sees.  What are democrats for?  Oh, but of course, equality for all and everyone has healthcare and jobs no matter what!  Republicans?  Work hard and earn what you own.  Entitlements are small to create an incentive to get a job.  From a basic standpoint, and quite illiterate, Democratic platform is more appealing. 
Yes, the statement that 20% of the electorate is definitely an understatement... I just didn't want to offend, 52% of the population  :-)

and yes, making a change that affects policy in a positive manner is going to be exceedingly difficult; because in the eyes of the media, or (liberal politicians), FACTS DON'T SEEM TO MATTER.  It's all about reelection.  For the politician, staying in power.  For the media, keeping them in power.

Most of our media has become like Pravda of the USSR.  Just a mouth piece for the party.  No matter what is said, done or intended, the message shouted to the public is that Republicans are heartless racists.

From a simple "politically expedient" perspective, lightening up on social issues is probably a good idea.  But many conservatives have a hard time setting aside their principles, just to get votes.

Democrats don't seem to carry that burden.

You're absolutely right. I also feel that it's not fashionable to be a Republican. Probably because so many younger people are pro-gay marriage, pro-choice, etc. But on the economic side, many of these same people probably haven't reached a point in life yet where the negative consequences of some of the policies the politicians that they vote for will really hit them in a meaningful way, so they can't really see the other side of the coin.
Republicans in the eyes of the American people are so unpopular on their stance on social issues that we the people have overlooked their stance on economic issues. A friend of mine, who is independent, said they didn't vote because she was for Obama socially, but for Romney economically. She didn't see which was more important in today's society. The economy right now is really tbh. Not much better. The problem we face today is that people have placed social issues above our own economy and I only hope that won't be the death of us. 
One word: Integrity
If they do what they say and preach it will happen, but they wont.

Get out of the wars, cut the fat military, and stop focusing so much on gay and abortion(these are cultural issues)
It can't and won't until it drives out the Neo-Conservatives that have hijacked it.

It's one thing to call someone ignorant. It's another to prove it
Well, personally I think one of the biggest problems is that it has great difficulty in getting a single cohesive message together. Think back to the Romney campaign and how often the national message on the economy would be derailed by social issues. Part of this goes to the wide range of groups in the GOP (values voter vs tea party vs corporate owner etc).

However, I think a less obvious problem is the media that backs the GOP. Basically everything that is not Fox news has been dubbed the "Mainstream Media" ad is attacked as being biased against the GOP. This is bad for two reasons. First, it implies that the GOP is outside the mainstream, which is dumb when you are trying to appeal to centrist voters. Secondly, it means that the power of Fox news personalities, and more radical internet sources, is much greater since there are fewer media offerings that are not biased against the GOP. Now, in turn, Fox and the internet have much more control over the conversation, but also are trying to reflect the views of its main viewers, which tend to be  more right wing. The result is that the news stories pushed by the media is more conservative and inflammatory than the actual majority of republicans  are or want to be(I think at least). Then, when you have the GOP leadership try and compromise or present mor emoderate ideas, it ends up contradicting the message being pushed by conservative media, thereby picking a fight with the very people that are supposedly supporting their cause. Essentially, right wing media presents a more conservative vision than the party really wants, and so the party as a whole is pushed to the right even if it does not want to be. The democratic party is saved from this because it has not demonized news sources outside of Fox news. So even though MSNBC is pretty liberal, the presence of CNN, ABC, and other more neutral agencies gives moderate and conservative Dems a place to present idea without being attacked. 

The GOP has to stand up to Fox, and extremely popular conservative personalities retake control of its own message. Stop creating a situation where you have a small number of acceptable news sources,a nd stop letting those sources be controlled by the most radical (and politically dangerous) members of the party. Make it so that the leaders, and potential leaders of the party can present practical (i.e Moderate) ideas without being attacked from all sides.

The story about the time that they did not have a dining car on Taft's train was hilarious! 
Chris Christ looks bigger then taft.
While historically correct that Lincoln was in the Republican party, I have always found it absurd to use the parties positions from 100+ years ago as  evidence of where they are at now. Both parties have evolved immensely since then, in terms of civil rights it is hard to argue that Republicans did more for civil rights when Lyndon Johnson (A democrat) signed both the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act. 
And people wonder why we think the MSM is full of morons...
The neo-cons took over the republican party when people stopped using the term "neo-con".
Think the last person to take National Security advice from is Dick Cheney.
The idea that only Democratic voters are ignorant in terms of economics is laughable. It's clear that both sides are full of ideologues, who aren't likely to be convinced by evidence at this point. What we need is pragmatists not more idiots that think free market philosophy or an even larger welfare state are the only way forward. 
Why not changes the stances? After all, parties should seek to please the populace in their actions to win elections, right? Otherwise the GOP dies a deserved death once all these young people are older and have kids themselves.
Btw, what is so important on gay marriage and the other shit? I thought the GOP was REALLY proud on it's economy ideas. Why not just give some guys the right to marry, what do you loose on that? If you believe it is wrong on religious reasons, well, then let them go to hell, why are you flustered here?
If I was the GOP, I'd let go of all this tiny bullshit, give them what they want on these soft issues, then make a huge comeback on the economy, after loosing the tremendous bad-guy image built up in the last decade. Fortunately, I am not the GOP.

http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/18icf7/marco_rubio_is_more_conservative_than_you_think/
Every two years the democract controlled media choses whom the Republicans will vote for. Every two years I see the Republicans do as they are told and those wanting small government then set around wondering why government continues to grow and taxes go up and freedom goes down. Currently the Democracts are pushing Rubio and Christie, if he will get his head out of oBamas ass long enough.
FTA:

During his February 2012 CPAC speech, at the height of the Republican primaries, Romney famously told activists that he was a “severely conservative” governor, a remark that drew scorn from his critics for its clunkiness.
The GOP is becoming the party of obstruction. They embrace nothing, oppose everything.

But you have to redefine it in order to keep it from being redefined; the whole thing is becoming Jim Crow, mk II.

And what "Culture" is being protected from Gay Marriage? [Because I do not think that word means what you think it means](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture). I think you mean Conscience, Values, Virtue, or Morality, and personally think the GOP should get out of the business of trying to be the Morality Police, &amp; regulating what happens in the bedroom, and back in the business of getting Government out of our Freedoms.
[deleted]
That's what I mean by  saying redefining marriage to save it from being redefined. You are basically saying "Separate but Equal" here, and then claiming that people would choose "Civil Unions" over "Civil Weddings" for no reason other than you'd like to see that so you can protect a handful of bigots from having to share a church with someone they dislike because of their personal misreading of the Bible... And how is this not Jim Crow mk. II?

And "Protecting" morality *IS* an assault on individual freedom &amp; individual responsibility. This is EXACTLY the same as the Liberals' Nanny State trying to legislate personal responsibility! By attempting force moral norms, that you just admitted are changing, on the people you are attempting to create a Nanny State to enforce how people take personal responsibility. You can't just say *Freedom*, you have to mean it. You can say they want "Freedom to terminate a pregnancy", and they respond that you want "Freedom to give guns to murderers". They are both the Nanny State trying to control the people.

Of course I wasn't saying anything about Abortion, I was speaking about Marriage, but you do know that the GOP Nanny State has put forward bills to not only ban all abortions and RU-186 pills, but also ban the Pill, Plan-B/Morning After pills, and all IUDs? Because you can't be trusted with the personal responsibility of birth control.

&gt;It's not bigoted to be against gay marriage.

...says the bigot.
The Miriam-Webster Dictionary defines [Bigot](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot) as "a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance."

So yes, it is literally bigoted to be obstinately against gay marriage.

Remind me again which political ideology has been most prominent in the last 30 years? Loose regulation, ultra free market, massive tax cuts for wealthy.. doesn't sound too liberal to me.
What bullshit. Out of control Military spending, a ridiculous Austerity stance, slashes to education and science... General ignorance of what every major economist says we should be doing about the economy... Don't even start trying to act like your obstructionist, simple minded Republicans are doing a single thing beneficial for this economy.

There's so much bullshit in that ridiculous Glenn Beck style rant that I don't even know where to begin. California has been in the shitter for some time, and a long stretch of Republican policies sure as hell didn't help.

They're rapidly turning things around and will start posting profit within the next couple years thanks to new Democratic policies. That's been common knowledge for months.

And to even try to claim the Republicans aren't obstructionist? Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. How many times have these guys filibustered in the last year alone? These idiots have proved again and again they'll fail against anything Obama says--- even if it was their idea in the first place.

And sure--- let's to ahead an de-regulate some more. That'll improve things. 

And hey, let's make sure that filthy rich people and corporations continue to get massive tax breaks because they're the real job creators, amirite?

Oh and ask the UK how that whole austerity thing is working out for them.

Your Republicans robotically believe in BULLSHIT.

[deleted]
I stopped reading this post and your prior about when I encountered Fox News buzzwords like "Job Creators" and "War On Business".

The awful Obama compromises you keep talking about- I assume its "horrible" stuff like raising the taxes on assholes like Mitt Romney a tiny percentage. Time to get with the picture: those guys are NOT job creators.

The key to a roaring economy is maximizing the amount of money circulating in the middle class- just like the Clinton years. That's what they're trying to go back to--- and it makes sense, then, that we've historically had better economies under democratic policy.

By the way, the recession and the big, terrible deficit were a result of Republican control. Period.

Why was our credit rating dropped? Republican obstructionism. 

It goes on and on.

If republican policy is so effective, why are the biggest welfare states ALL republican? Because the ideology (austerity, cutting social programs, deregulation) are flawed. No wonder most economists agree on this.

You said it best yourself: you don't understand the policies.
Oh, and by by the way-- you don't get to chastise me for ignoring fallacious contentions in your scattershot diatribe above if you're going to skirt around addressing an issue that I've brought up thrice now:

Austerity.

It's proven to be bullshit, yet your guys push for it continually.

Why?

I mean, Republicans are the party that debate the legitimacy of rape- and nope, that's not just a talking point. This perpetuated for MONTHS. They're the party that tries to force creationism into the classroom. They want to balloon military spending even MORE.
Gays getting married? Not on our watch, says the GOP.
Hell, I just saw a video last week of a slack jawed republican literally reading a bunch of accurate statistics about gun violence and then concluding his little sermon by saying that violent videogames are the cause.

I could go on and on with just examples from 2012 alone.

Honest question: When they're getting SO MUCH wrong... why in the hell would I ever place my trust in Republicans. Why do they believe in bullshit? 

And one last thing: I AM a business owner. I work in the advertising and media industry. If you haven't noticed, the economy is ramping up. We're doing way better than last year already. In a down economy, ESPECIALLY in Michigan in the winter time advertising is the FIRST thing that businesses cut when it gets tight.

Instead, we're exploding. 

Again, I'll say it: This war on business stuff is straight up BULLSHIT.


Stop calling me a victim.
Mother fuck, I love seeing Republicans get destroyed like this. Good show.

shhh, logic doesn't work with people who rely on memes to convey a point
I decided to take a break from r/politics and check out r/republicans (I'm a moderate liberal), and I just wanted to say this is one of the best laid out arguments I've heard about this problem. I have a huge problem with mainstream media overall, but feel Fox has created a lot of those issues as well. But that's an argument for another thread.

Anyways, thanks!
Take your god damn logic and reason out or /r/republicans, you facist!  
;)
TL;DR Ignorance
I'll speak as someone who is absolutely disgusted by conservatives right now, but I'm not attacking you. If just one of you reads this and understands that what I'm saying is perfectly reasonable, it's worth my time.  
Bring logic, reason and facts back into the party. No more legitimate rape comments. No more oppressing women and preventing them from obtaining adequate healthcare. No more pretending all poor people are lazy, use drugs, and are out to destroy society. No more pretending that anything the federal government does it bad. No more discriminating against (pick one: homosexuals, muslims, legal immigrants, etc.) because your religion says so.  
The government exists to support and empower it's people. Instead of running it into the ground because your ideology dictates it is inherently evil, realize that it's necessary to govern a society this large, and look into way to govern effectively and efficiently.  
And compromise. You don't know it all. You never will. Often, other people will have better ideas. Instead of fearing change and villifying them, embrace the power of better ideas.  
As far as I can tell, when you're proven wrong, the offocial party stance is Double Down.  
Trickle-down economics proven a sham? Suppress the information and push harder for it.

Can't wait to hear the GOP tear her apart for her role in Benghazi. 
Oh grow up
He had me at 'scattershot diatribe.'
&gt;a ridiculous Austerity stance

Yes cutting INCREASES in FUTURE spending is somehow austerity.
It doesn't change the fact that they're still pushing it non-stop. That's at the top of their agenda. Every child with access to the internet knows this. Think before you speak, GOP dingus. 
Let me throw out some numbers so u understand.

Lets say we spend 150 million every year.

This year the budget increased by 10 million.

We cut 2.5 million from the increase.

We are now spending 157.5 million.

Still more then last year.

Spending more then we did last year, is not austerity.
And yes, dingus: that's the very definition of Austerity. Reeling in Government spending (especially in social programs) as if a Government's economy were as simple as a checking account.

In reality, it does the opposite of what it is intended to do.

Now we've revealed who doesn't know what they're talking about-- it's time to study up or stop making more white noise.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity

Let me repeat myself: they campaign and push for Austerity policies. Period.
Does anyone really care what Trump thinks?   I don't.
Does anyone really care what Rand Paul thinks? I don't.

One thing I noticed in this recent campaign was that Obama and his campaigners would attack Romney on every possible thing they could find.  As a result we had a lot of dumb mud slinging on their side.  The dog on car thing, and how Romney indirectly killed someone by firing them, and the Swiss bank accounts (why are those bad again), and his tax rate (that he has not control over).

The list goes on and on.  But Romney and his campaign focused on the issues.  They didn't attack Obama on countless things that they could have.  As much as I hate to say it, if we want to win an election, were going to have to stoop to their level.  We're going to have to start nit picking every single little stupid thing and turning it into a big deal.  They totally avoided Obama's past in the campaign, as a result we now have no clue who Obama really is.  Yet we know that Romney may have bullied a homosexual kid in high school once (pretty sure it was debunked)... It was front-page news...

That's why we lost the election.  We acted like grown ups and focused on the issues.  That doesn't work anymore.

TL;DR we have to make every small thing a big deal like the Obama campaign did to Romney.  We can't just focus on the issues anymore like Romney tried.  It doesn't work in today's society.

This was an interesting read but I disagree with their assessment of what lost the Democrats. The war was part of it but the Civil Rights legislation and Nixon's southern strategy were also huge parts of the shift. 
I sometime sfind trumps opionions and responses interesting.  But I though Rand Paul's filibuster was beautiful and definitely got people talking about limitations to federal power. And Incase no one saw we got a direct answer from the White House saying they would never use drones on American soil.
Not if we keep referring to them as computer geeks, they can't.
wait for it..... BENGHAZI!!!!

BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!BENGHAZI!!!!

Yes, please talk about the issues. The American people would love for you to once in your life to talk about the actual issues that affect americans.
Wow.  How dare you.

So the lives of those Americans who were abandoned by their government don't mean anything to you.  You're the worst kind of person.
Oh get over yourself, or keep believing in the conspiracy. It was a tragedy, but far from the hyperventilating narrative FOX drummed up.

With 4,000 dead soldiers, over 100,000 dead Iraqis. Get in line when you start talking about worst kinds of people. Or do you want to start talking about how you want to gut SCHIP, Medicare, and Medicaid.

Seriously, get out of your ass and welcome to reality. 


100,000?  Can I see your source on that?

Know what, go back to /r/politics.  You really need to sort out your priorities.
are you shitting me? No wonder an asshole like you keeps acting like Romney was a saint, you are living in a fantasy land. 

Go off to Redstate and talk about how amazing Romney was. they love the echo chamber.
Wow.  How old are you? 14?
I live in California.  Far from "red state" my friend.
I'd try to debate you more, but you honestly aren't worth the time of day.  You're nobody, and too stubborn to be convinced of any lick of logic or reason.
That's really stupid, seeing as Republicans already do that in addition to just making shit up (Obama birth certificate nonsense) and not to mention because it lacks integrity. Seeing as the GOP is running on empty in that department as it is, don't you think that explaining in simple terms without BS why their policies would be beneficial would be the better strategy?
Wow guys, that was fucking constructive.

Why didn't you just tear him apart by posting a couple of facts instead of dissolving into childish insults?
But the government doesn't make jobs!
I thought job creators made jobs? Not the government. Isn't that why we have low taxes for the wealthy and corporations? So they can create jobs?

btw lol "war on businesses" a war! So serious! I didn't notice Obama drone striking them. Must've all happened right around the time he lowered taxes on businesses and didn't persecute the bankers, right?
You got destroyed, son.
Fuck yea dude. I was just on r/politics losing my mind. I saw this 30 seconds ago, BINGO.

Republicans lost when they allowed religion to take over the party.   The term conservative now means religious conservative and not fiscal conservative.  Republicans no longer hold to the ideals of this country, that everyone is created equal and that there should be separation of church and state.  Until republicans can stop pandering to the religious right, it will always find itself comprising this country's ideals for the sake of votes.

That's the way it is, like, 90% of the time.
I know it is a month ago when you wrote this, but I couldn't agree more. Romney, especially in his last 2 debates, seemd to say "I'd practice foreign policy just like Obama!"

Why vote Obama-lite?

His inability to explain why bengahzi was bad was the final nail in his coffin. It's the same reason that asshole in this thread typed the word Bengahzi 10 times and flipped out about it - Because it was truly a sore spot.

What Romney needed to do was pull George bush out from under the bus and explain what was wrong with Obama's policy of Bombing libya for 8 months, insisting no one call it war, and abandoning the place to the 1700 militias they armed and no centralized police or military... and the insistance that Libya was a perfect Utopia by both the administration as well as the media is why Bengahzi happened.
Rep. are so stupid that every two years the Democract controlled media will pick a big government Rep and run stories and build them up saying how Rep they are so tough and how afraid the Dem are of this person and sure enough , the Rep will vote for the big gov Rep. who is really just a big gov Dem and the dog and pony show marches on.
Auuuugh.  I hate seeing shit like this.  Is there anyone in this party that doesn't like flaunting their opinion in the tackiest ways possible? 
Why is this important? I would rather have a good leader who's an asshole in private than a decent, moral, courteous man who keeps making the wrong decisions.

LOL. Of all people *you* should be used to not being the smartest guy around, Lube. Of course, arrogant moron that you are, you think you're smarter than most anyone. Even President Bush. 

The left has a narrative that Republicans are either evil or stupid. They put Reagan in the "stupid" category only admitting he's also a smart guy many years later. I see you just buy into it without if any critical thought, which is typical of people of common intellect.

If you think that I'm upvoting myself feel free to report me to the Admins for it. They won't hesitate to ban me from the site. 

I'm sorry but if you think that George W Bush is an idiot then you're wrong. You don't have to agree with him to think he's bright, and you don't have to think he's a good leader to think he's bright either. Take a look over at Washington Post's Ezra Klein's recent [blog](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/24/george-w-bush-wasnt-dumb-but-he-was-still-a-bad-president/) about that story. He doesn't think Bush was a good President, but he doesn't think Bush was stupid either. Any intelligent Republican would tell you that Carter, Obama, and Clinton are all bright. So long as they're being honest, that is.

Just like I'll have no regrets not supporting his fat ass for anything.
Me too! And the GOP won't start winning again until they pull him out from under the bus.
...and?
You are so cute. Say "and" again, but this time in caps and with some outrage!
...AND?!?!?
oh mi gawd checkmater liberaltards. its all obamas fault obv
Huh. It wasn't as satisfying as I thought.... Maybe some bold?
I don't know which is worse, her stooping to those tactics or the group of idiots who believe she was in the right to do it.  If you can't beat conservatives on the issues, just defame the hell out of 'em, right?
That's fairly simple to debunk.  Democrats controlled both House and Senate back in '10 when the original "Shut down Gitmo" language was proposed for that year's NDAA.  Instead, amendments were passed that deliberately obstructed the President from spending money on transporting prisoners off the island, securing US prisons for detention, or paying for domestic criminal prosecutions.

You can't even argue that Gitmo defunding was filibustered in the Senate, because all this work was passed in the Dem-controlled House.

Now, where it gets tricky is on two points.  Firstly, was it the *President's* fault that Gitmo is still open?  No.  Of course not.  Obama proposed a shut down of the prison, civilian trials, and release or sentencing for the remaining prisoners.  He was denied this by many within his own party.  Secondly, were Republicans *also* responsible for Gitmo staying open?  Absolutely.  They voted right alongside the cowardly House Democrats and created the majority needed to pass pro-Gitmo amendments.  What's more, they've had ample opportunity in the last 3 years to propose a Gitmo shutdown under Speaker Boehner, and none have been forthcoming.

So if you're looking for anti-Gitmo legislators in 2014, voting straight ticket Republican probably isn't a smart move.  Voting straight ticket Democrat probably isn't a smart move, either.  You're going to have to actually look at individual politicians and their stated preferences / voting records, before you can expect to see Gitmo closed after the next election cycle.

The rise of Chris Christie is really a big story. His real world results make him a very interesting candidate. The hardest part for him would be getting through the primaries.

Republicans "talk" about small gov. ."Talk" about end to the endless wars, "Talk" about so many things. Yet, every two years when it is time to vote, they do just what they are told to do by the Democract party controlled media and vote for the ones the Dem. have chosen for them.. Then they go back to "Gosh", I sure wish the wars would end, I wish-----Rubio &amp; Christie R.I.N.O.
It's sad that so much money is used for elections while people are starving on the street. The U.S. political system is fucked.

I wouldn't characterize Hitler or Stalin as great leaders or men who made the right decisions. But there are men who are moral in their decisions but have immoral personal habits, and i'd prefer that to people who are bad at their jobs. Republicans think that way too, see Vitter, Sanford, et al.
As a liberal I agree this is wrong and should be investigated.  

I would now also like to point all Republicans to the story of "The little boy who cried wolf" for an explanation as to why this story might not get the legs they hope it does. 
Amen to that
How does letting people die happen to give him a partisan advantage?
Are you clowns really posting this and high fiving over it? 
Billary neglected to give more security to the embassy before the election. And they tried to cover it up because they knew there would've been a huge stir on the dem party before November. 
I'm more asking why this image made it sound like they let them die on purpose.
I'm sure it would be no worse than the racism he was accused of, because of Katrina.

You forgot:

* Bomb Libya for 8 months until the Qaddafi regime is destroyed and insist no one call it war... it is "Non-War" and he doesn't need the permission of congress to do it... And there is no need to help rebuild the nation we destabilized and filled with weapons.

But I can see how that is too long to squeeze into the photoshop.

[Under Bush the IRS targeted a Liberal groups](http://www.politicususa.com/irs-targeted-liberal-churches-bush.html)
I think you are confusing the word "Brash" with "Manly". Neither of those two are manly in stature or appearance. They are loud mouthed and opinionated though.
I'm fucking shocked at this picture..

"There are 100% WMD's in Iraq"
Aug, 2001 "you've covered your ass. Go home"
THE FUCKING PATRIOT ACT. The entire reason wiretapping and these security 'scandals' exist in the first place. 

There are things Obama has done that are downright totalitarian. None of the things mentioned in the picture have any basis in fact. 
Republicans: Nobody cares about this except you. You should have saved up some of that hate because at this point it's all been squandered and none of you are credible with the general public.
That these idiots are now proudly showing pictures of Bush allover the place is a clear indicator just how deep the indoctrination is for some of them.

Really, really sad-- the lack of reason is just so staggering.
There's a reason he cancelled his trip to fucking Sweden. God damned war crimes. Not saying the drone war, unilateral murder, life internment, GitMo etc. are justified but the world has passed judgement. To appeal to any part of that era is terrifying.
No man, he kept us safe!

The Obama Crony? Michelle Malkin? This kind of shit is why Republican rhetoric is becoming the laughing stock of the world. 
I dont see them going up any time soon, there is a lot of outrage at corporations.  Unless republicans do a 360 and start supporting constitutional rights, ending military spending, and actually being fiscally conservative I dont see a turn around.  Their numbers are dying off every year.
Ironic coming from the guy who lied to get us into a war with Iraq. :\ 4k US troops have died over that lie.
Their dam well we should be outrage at corporations look how many don't pay taxes. Part of being fiscally conservative is responsibility. They can lobby with their money to change the tax rate we can't.
In the same way they reacted when confronted with it here...

The inventors of the patriot act?  The act that expanded random every day crimes to domestic terrorism and tried to implement "sneak and peek" warrants and roving wiretaps.  Ya, I'd say both parties have fair claim of shitting on the constitution.
I'm as liberal as they come who opposed Bush vigorously while he was president. Gotta give credit to GWB here for being willing to hang out one on one with all these wounded solidiers, many of whom were injured as a direct result of his decisions. 
Odd thumbnail choice.
Before you get your conservative panties up in too much of a wad:

&gt;FTA: Bonnie Esrig, a 38-year IRS veteran and a manager in the Cincinnati office until she retired from the IRS in January, also has told NBC News that decisions about how to handle cases came from management, and that all employees were subjected to considerable oversight. **She also said that she believes there was no political or partisan motivation for the added scrutiny.**
Huff Po comments read like the scribble on grade school bathroom walls. Thanks OP.
I can't even read the H. Post anymore. Way too liberal, along with all of it's readers.
Anymore? I don't know when Arianna Huffington wasn't a shill for the DNC, along with the entire website.
True. I mainly read [DrudgeReport](http://www.drudgereport.com) which links to Reuters, AP, and others.
me too. I like realclearpolitics.com because it gives me both sides... and while I think Huffpo is ridiculously slanted I still like to know what the other side thinks too. It's good practice, hard as it is to force yourself to read....
I'll check that out. Thanks!
Mission accomplished, right guys?
Far from... Too many like the Clintons
Drudge has long been a too much of a gossip site to use as a primary news source. Lately he's even been posting to Infowars quite a bit, which is troubling. I like RealClearPolitics (and its sister sites like RealClearWorld), just as Gnome_sane does. Other good sources of news include USA Today, The Week, Google News, and financial web sites like Bloomberg. It's good to get views from different sides of the issues, and that's what RCP, USA Today, and The Week more or less try to do.

&gt;I realize with a title like this you might expect this to read like some kind of Daily Kos type liberal trolling

To quote the awesome LANA Kane.... YUUUUUP!

I couldn't get thru the third sentence. Which part was so awesome?
She was in 08 and in 12 too....

The real question is - Why won't she run?

I've sent her e-mails since 2006 begging her not to abandon the party when we needed her the most. She stays current, gives her opinion... And Stanford has to be so fucking boring in comparison. Sure, maybe she is angling for that NFL spot she always dreamed of... But wouldn't the Presidency be a little more fulfilling?

You couldn't make it past the third sentence?   Well thanks for trying. Anyone with an attention span willing to take a shot at this article? 
Within the article, the author spends a lot of time not saying very much.  In summary, he states that banking was under-regulated, which lead to our current recession, and that Conservatism fights against regulation.  Therefor, as a self-defined "utilitarian," he argues for a progressive tax structure (to offset the economic divide between the rich and poor) and broad market regulations.

Here's the problem...

There is just no reasonable set of circumstances that would have led to the wildly risky behavior of leveraging the sub-prime mortgage backed securities other than these toxic loans being backed by the Federal government.  It was PRECISELY government intervention in the secondary mortgage market which inserted the toxicity into the market in the first place.

The United States Federal Government incentivized people to buy homes they couldn't afford, and when they could no longer keep up with their home loans that they shouldn't have qualified for in the first place, they ended up getting beat down by the fat end of the recession stick.

Therefor, you can't say you're a utilitarian, and want to enable federal policies that help those that are on the bottom of the economic ladder, and then support the same kind of Federal intervention that ultimately punishes the same people you're claiming to support.

Being a conservative entails looking at not just the *intent* of a government program, but it's *outcome* as well.  And, as such, a conservative often finds that the most optimal way, indeed the most utilitarian way, of spreading goods and services throughout an economy, is to in large part get the government out of the way.
Nice to see you defend your opinion. Clearly you can't be trolling.


Edit: responded to the wrong person. Not interested in conversing with gnomes. 
I'm not sure how you got to that conclusion from my comments.

I actually blame the government for abandoning capitalism and bailing out the "too big to fail" rather than letting capitalism run its course. If the "Too Big" were allowed to fail, as capitalism requires, then the "economic disparity" that I hear 99% of my liberal friends rail on and on about would have corrected itself quite a bit. Instead of banks being able to sit on houses until the market rebounded, I'd have been able to buy a home at a reasonable price because the banks would have been forced to sell or go bankrupt. It was the socialist policy of "too big to fail" that I speak against, and have done so since 08. 

Beyond that, how did the few sentences I wrote lead you to your conclusion? Did you possibly jump to that conclusion without any foundation?
Oh. For a second there I thought you were not an asshole. Glad to see you are at least constant.
That response was meant for the person that read the article. I had you confused. 
Interesting response, thank you. My only issue is that you seem fully ready to blame the financial crisis on government intervention but a lack of regulation escapes any criticism. I see that as an ideological decision you've made to only look at some factors you prefer while ignoring others. 
With all due respect, I'm not ignoring anything as a result of an ideological decision.  I'm looking at incentives.

Bankers have a natural incentive to invest in low-risk, high-yield assets.  The sub-prime bundled mortgages were, by any metric, HIGH-risk, high-yield assets.  As such, any banking institution would have treated them with the necessary caution.

However, because the Federal government securitized these loans, they went from HIGH-risk, to excessively LOW risk.  Thus, the bankers began consuming them without hesitation.  As the money began pouring in, more an more investment bankers looked for more and more ways to invest and otherwise leverage these assets.

All of this led to the derivatives market collapse, which is too often blamed as the casus belli of the recession.

It is completely disingenuous to say that these bankers would have over leveraged these assets had they not been secured by the Federal government.  It is a classic example of unintended consequences when the Federal government does something with the *intent* of helping people, only to have it backfire and hurt the very people they were intent on helping.

By the laws of Germany (at the time), the soldier's actions weren't illegal either...

Just because a corrupt power says something is legal does not make it so.
That's not much of a backhanded compliment. It's actually quite weak. 
I think this kind of childish hate - summed up best by the birther movement- is why many people wouldn't even consider voting for a republican. I do understand that Bush Derangement Syndrome also occurs on the opposite side of the isle... but acting out for "Revenge" or out of pure hatred really does no one in politics any good at all.

So if you like this kind of humor, and you also want the GOP to move on to win elections; *please keep it in the privacy of your home and do not advertise it.* Be better than the people you hate so much and voice your disagreements using arguments, facts and smiles. Use the sentence "You are not evil, you are just wrong" and live by that mantra - even if only in public. If you really need to go home and wipe your ass with Obama's face to feel good, I'd suggest you try and find some new hobby.
[deleted]
I'm not. RUN JEB, RUN!

Regardless of who runs, the candidate who remembers what the GOP supported in 2000-2008, can explain the difference between that foreign policy and the current mess of a foreign policy, and unite the country behind the party rather than try and re-brand the party or pretend they were not part of it - THAT will be the next candidate to win it for the GOP.

[Oh you](http://i.imgur.com/qk6eu.gif)
Rubio wants to arm Syrian rebels, I think that says enough on its own.  I think people are sick of arming up and coming terrorists just to create more enemies abroad.
FTA: 

&gt;“Clearly, the bad guys have already changed their ways,” Rogers said. “Remember, these were counterterrorism programs, essentially, and we have seen that bad guys overseas, terrorists who are committing and plotting atacks on the United States and our allies, have changed the way they operate. We’ve already seen that. To say that that is not harmful to the national security of the United States or our safety is just dead wrong.”
&gt; Christie, who already vetoed a gay marriage bill in the past, has said he’d do the same with another one but also has called for a ballot referendum on the issue, and did again on the radio show.

&gt; “You’re talking about changing an institution that’s over 2,000 years old. Seems to me that, you know … the Democrats are putting an increase to the minimum wage on the ballot,” Christie said, noting Democratic opposition to a referendum. “That’s important enough to put on the ballot. But gay marriage is not. That’s something the people should decide, but not whether same-sex marriage should happen in New Jersey.”

&gt; He added, “I’ve made it very clear since 2009 that I believe that marriage should be between one man and one woman. I’ve said that, I ran on that, I’ve said it consistently. That doesn’t mean, in any way shape or form, that I have anything against folks who are homosexual. In fact, I’ve said I believe people are born that way. I don’t believe it’s a choice … you were born with your sexual preference. But I believe that the institution of marriage for 2,000 years has been between a man and a woman.”

I know who I won't be nominating.
If everyone voted that fatties shouldn't be allowed to get married, would he honor that? I mean, it'd be the will of the people. Wouldn't it be *insulting* to the voting public if he stayed married after that vote, being a lard ass and all?
He almost had me convinced that the GOP had some hope in 2016. Guess not.
Rand Paul my friend.
We'll see. He seems to be pretty concerned with holding on to the Christian right.  I don't blame him because the left will never embrace his free market fervor.
I honestly haven't liked a GOP nominee this much in a while and I can only hope that voters will think the same. I predict/wish a republican wins 2016, I have a feeling some of the brainwashed liberals will wake up due to the recent NSA events and what not. One can only hope.
I wouldn't call it brainwashed. I have always considered myself a moderate, and I have a serious mistrust of Republicans at this point. They did this, not the "liberal media". Every time they get the mike they start in with the crazy talk.  All I want is personal freedom and efficient, succinct government programs/spending. Why is that too much to ask?
I totally agree, I am in no favor what so ever of the 2 party system but I believe the right has always been adamant on personal freedoms. The thing that gives republicans a bad name are these insane social conservatives which I am in no favor of. If Rand Paul were to run as a Libertarian candidate he would never become president so I totally understand if he has to appeal to the not so libertarian republicans in order to win. I'm not advocating lying about what he believes in but he can make compromises which is necessary to be a good politician in my opinion.  
...and is attacked for political incorrectness.
I've just started reading Bush's memoir "Decision Points", a great read so far. As these pics show he's a very down-to-earth person.
I read it during one of my flights to the Philippines. It's a fantastic book.

That's right. Remember green-light was caught numerous times posting to white supremacist web sites. Some others from NLW are open nazi-types, the rest are a mix of closeted Nazs like crackduck or just plain stupid people like BrapAllgood.

I don't understand chief.

If he really wanted to reduce violence, he'd push for our rights to carry. Criminals think twice when a populace is armed. 

http://theacru.org/acru/harvard_study_gun_control_is_counterproductive/
What gets me is he uses a self defense case to promote gun control. 
Why the fuck would we honor that piece of shit. NO_LIMIT_NIGGA attacked a man and was put down like the rabid dog he was. Fuck you Obama. This is absurd. 
If our government knew anything they would shut the fuck up about this trial and not use it as a way to get more support for gun control. Criminals will always get guns or any type of weapon even in they are illegal. Crime and murder rate would skyrocket because criminals would just break in to people's houses or mug people because we have no way of defending our selfs. 
Guns are our last resort to shit like the NSA, the reason they are protected isnt to protect us from ourselves, its to protect us from our government.
[deleted]
Gun vs. weaponinzed tanks, aircraft, and military. Your gun means nothing against the current government. This is why the Constitution needs to be re-written to reflect today.
Oh dear god, and all we got out of it was health coverage for a large portion of Americans.  Barf***
But we didn't...

Healthcare wasn't socialized. If John Doe doesn't purchase his health coverage, he's hit with a fine from the IRS that increases each year.

And these numbers don't even reflect large institutions.  Go ahead and look at what states are doing for their statewide employment system like state colleges.

I can tell you first hand that the college I worked for reduced hours and imposed restrictions for all faculty and staff.  No more course overages (less classes offered), but also not hiring more faculty to take on the needed overages (and tuition still went up).

Then most part-time, those working 37.5 hours a week (considered part-time) were put on a schedule to be reduced to 28 hours this fiscal year and then most positions were being reduced to 21 hours the following fiscal year.

For any position that remained above 30 hours, they were forced to opt into the private health insurance the school offered.  That cost is to be incurred by the employee, which further reduces their pay-wage.

So when you sarcastically lament about getting healthcare coverage, you're not considering all the costs and cuts that a ton of workers are are going to suffer from.

I don't believe it ... Yoder voted to uphold my rights???? That is not like him.
I've been posting similar here, to /r/teaparty, and to several other privacy and security groups.  Wired has a good story up right now as well:
http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/money-nsa-vote/
John McCain...

rejected the Keystone Pipeline deal.

voted against repealing the healthcare law.

stated we should stay in Iraq for 100 years.

Of course he and Rand don't get along.


The Washington Posts Jennifer Rubin (conservative) said..."McCain lost his cool with Rand Paul and sounded like the old man down the street screaming to the new kids on the block, “Get off my lawn!”"

He's a crony capitalist who fears that Rand threatens the establishment(IE. HIM). 

I'm guessing Rand didn't vote for John either.
If John McCain decides he won't support him, then the logical choice is to support him.
Like anyone gives a shit what McCain thinks.
McCain is a joke. 
He is literally the only person who can.
Some people have very short, but politically convenient, memories.
This is only temporary- and for all that capitalists lament implementations like this; the simple fact is- there will be a demand, and businesses will seek to fill it. So yes, short-sighted employers will seek to cull down hours NOW, but when they don't have the workforce to compete with other institutions that are sucking it up and offering a greater breadth of service to it's customers AND attracting the most skilled laborers for the benefits, then either they will die (as capitalists constantly scream they should) or they will adapt and we will stop seeing workers have to go to jobs with tumors in their bodies because otherwise their families can't eat.
I hope the President has a full recovery!
I hope he's all right.
My reaction as a liberal
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMyjXHNq99I
Yes, they have no direction and have become the part of obstructionists. More anti-Democrat than pro-Republican. People get tired of negative messages. Libertarians are proof of that.
Definitely. I was at a bar the other day and two people, obviously republicans, brought up how much they hated Obama. I told them that I don't like Obama either but probably for different reasons and my advice to them was to stop spreading so many untruths about Obama (Kenyan, Socialist, etc) and focus on the legitimate reasons that he's not doing such a great job. I told them that I was socially liberal, pro gay marriage but also pro-gun and pro death penalty and mostly fiscally conservative and that there were a lot of things that we could probably agree on. I was polite and hopeful we could have an intelligent discussion. 

Both of them shut down and said they didn't want to talk about politics and looked at me like I was an asshole, even though it was they who brought the subject up.  Apparently they enjoy hating Obama for what Rush Limbaugh tells them to hate him for rather than wanting to get at any sort of truth. 

This kind of shit is only discrediting the party and making it more likely that Democrats will consolidate their power and slowly become more and more corrupt because absolute power corrupts absolutely. When one of two viable parties in the US turns itself into a joke, the other party can do whatever they want because they know that rational people have nowhere else to go. 
If this was George W getting made fun of he wouldn't have done anything. Why does Obama and the Democrats have to?
I would have thought Democrats would have had a lot of experience with mocking a president by now.  So freedom of speech only applies when protesting a white president?
Its sad that its so true. 

Anything said against obama is immediately considered "racist"


What a great way to pull together as a nation and try to stop this widening bipartisan nonsense. Way to go, they just dug a ditch to bury us in.

Racism and double standards
Someone please find me a real republican / conservative (maybe those 2 can no longer co-exsist) that actually supports Christie?  What a joke.

Rubio, while he is certainty taking a stance that many do not agree with on immigration has a good shot.  I dont know the full details on his plans (does he?) but if he were to ensure border security, a penalty for those here illegally and a pathway for GREEN CARD (NOT CITIZENSHIP) then I would perhaps support him.

On that list though, I am all for Rand Paul.  
&gt;Someone please find me a real republican / conservative (maybe those 2 can no longer co-exsist) that actually supports Christie? 

I'm a conservative and i support Christie.

Then again i'm not a Republican, nor am i a right wing religious anti government Tea Party member who believe Obama secretly born in Kenya.


I hate this bullshit where you have to be a conservative to be considered a "real" Republican. This is so fucking annoying. 
If your not a conservative at your core then what do you identify with as a set of values?  Democrats are mostly liberal in there policies...  honest question, what values as a republican do you have?
Socially progressive and politically Republican. Small government, low taxes, less handouts, less subsidies, and so on. The typical Republican platform.

However, I just don't agree with conservatism. I find it counter productive, religious, and too personally intruding. 

But then again, I may just completely dump the Republican boat, because they seem too keep preaching smaller government, but tend to keep increasing it's size. 
Quite literally "Thanks Obama". 
Because any story that undermines the "America is incurably racist, and only the Democrats can save you" narrative is quickly and efficiently smothered in its' crib.
It's because he was appointed, not elected.

For a government as grossly inefficient and sprawling as this, it seems more likely that it was a simple mistake. Even if it were a deliberately misplaced invitation, who can you blame with misplacing it? I'm not saying you're wrong, but it doesn't add up. Not everything is an attack.

A boy was killed for an expressly racial reason, that is a civil rights issue. That's also irrelevant. It's a PR stunt, and no modern politician has ever been above such things.

What was it the generals used to call Rumsfeld? Oh yes, it was "Donnie Do-Nothing". 

"… the worst style of leadership I witnessed in thirty-eight years of service or have witnessed at the highest levels of the corporate world since then" - [Gen. Hugh Shelton](http://nation.time.com/2010/10/13/top-general-rumsfeld-was-worst-leader-ever/)

"… he has culpability associated with the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and, so, rather than admitting these mistakes, he continually justifies them to the press ... and that really disallows him from moving our strategy forward." - [Maj. Gen. Charles Swannack](http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/13/iraq.rumsfeld/)

"… "incompetent strategically, operationally and tactically", and was "far more than anyone else responsible for what has happened to our important mission in Iraq". - [Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/13/iraq.usa)






and now, his bringing the 'big stick' to the U.N.'s C.W. Conv. seems to have worked.   Donnie, any chance you might think of a new way to paint our president a coward in an effort to pad your bank account?  
There are at least two or three different kinds of republicans.  Currently, the loudest are out of step with America; they get louder because they know this and are afraid.  Watch for more registered republicans to go independent until the noise finally runs its course.
I agree. Good post. 
I agree wholeheartedly with increasing the # of Reps. 

IDK about term limits.

As for reducing their wages, I would be more inclined to pay them far more, millions, so they won't be so easily led astray by lobbyists, and knowing that even if they get fired, they are still loaded.

I am also partial towards returning the election of Senators back to the state representatives.
Since you are posting in a Republican subreddit I was fully prepared to find your post ridiculous at best.  However, you have my respect, my upvote, and my apologies for pre-judging.  Good post with some good ideas!  If it matters, I would classify myself as a Progressive Independent.  I also feel unrepresented in government at every level.
Allowing Senators to be elected by state representatives gives states the direct influence in our government that they deserve and our constitution intended states to have.  It is really crazy that many states basically have to hire lobbyists to get the attention of the federal government.
I was thinking about term limits because it prevents people from becoming career politicians. It prevents our country from being run by a cavalcade of old men who don't represent the interests of everyone in the country.

 It seems like everyone starts out bright eyed and bushy tailed  in politics, ready to help and solve problems, but over time everyone becomes jaded by the process and we all (the common people) lose out. 

The thought on reduction of pay is due to an overwhelming lack of empathy on the part of politicians towards the poor and lower middle class. Our senators and representatives have comprehensive health insurance and salaries that are easy to live on; why should they care about healthcare reform or minimum wage? 

Also, why is it that even though our country is broke and congress has less than a 20% approval rating, we continue to pay them in the face of sequestration? If I barely ever showed up for work and then failed to perform when I did, I would be fired, yet this practice is commonplace for politicians. 

It just doesn't strike me as being fiscally conservative to pay someone [a lot of money] to sit around doing nothing all day while our infrastructure falls apart.  I imagine that paying them less will either motivate them to be replaced by someone who cares about doing the job or at the very least cut the country's costs. 
I appreciate the contribution. Your title put to words what I was thinking and feeling.

Imposing minimum wage is a race to the bottom, though. (It smarts of a quick fix.) Term limits may be applicable but then those few souls who do actually do this as a service to the people, their entire lives, we'd never see that again. That's not to say that the equivalent of "insider trading" that occurs within DC shouldn't be stomped out. (The richest districts in the country do surround DC.) It galls, I know, with this being a very ineffective congress. Any farmer, mechanic, stock broker, or CEO should be able to take up the post equally but the job should pay well enough for him to have a suit and represent. Not have to take on a second and third job to scrape by. (not requiring you to have made a fortune before you get there or to get there).

You cannot legislate how people think so the undertone for me is that culturally we need to grow. Exponentially.  We've lost something. There was a dignity, beyond money and might makes right, that used to define America.

Furthermore: We don't have the capability for 10,000 reps to get together and effectively debate or discuss anything (within a reasonable amount of time), without information technology. Only a closed system would be safe enough for them to use. Then maybe you could expand representation. But the reason so many Majority Speakers and Minority Whips have so much power (state and fed) is because of the sheer amount of 'stuff' to do. To get through it they let representatives of the representatives make the big deals and everyone falls in line... 

There was a rep, I forget which state, who blew up on the floor at a 200 page bill they were handed 15 minutes before a vote. He made a good point about due diligence taking a hit this way.

Edit: clarity; correction
I understand the logic behind paying them more, but I think this is the wrong solution for your correct diagnosis.  I don't think that serving in government should be an automatic step into the aristocracy, instead, we should work to limit lobbyist influence by strengthening campaign finance laws and curbing the easy flow of money to politicians. 
I always appreciate an article that starts by telling me how I feel.
[deleted]
The old GOP is dead. The new GOP is libertarian/constitutionalist and will bring back America from the brink, it won't be easy though.
We have a lot of work to do. I suggest talking to immediate family that are stuck in the old way. That is what I have been doing with my uncle. He went from neo-con to moderate with some libertarian leanings.
I feel like the GOP's issue is that they aren't allowing room for moderate and progressive members on the Republican platform. Which is exactly the problem, especially with a young generation that is much more progressive. 

Also, the party needs to be better at picking its battles. Right now, they are picking a losing fight. For instance, gay rights, climate change, and abortion are subjects that are clearly decided on by the general public and are continuing to grow with support. Trying to fight these issues is a completely losing battle, and it makes them look anti-progressive. 

Also, while all of congress is bought off by big money, the Republicans get a majority of the flack. This has a lot to do with the fact that they come off as a party not doing anything, just impeding and dismantling. For instance, instead of trying to slash food stamps as a solution, they need to offer a system that still offers similar benefits, but at a cheaper price. Slashing these benefits without offering a better solution just make them look like they hate the poor. 

Dunno, I just think the GOP has a terrible brand right now and I don't see any viable future for them. I'm not the only Republican I know that no longer identifies as Republican in many situations simply because of the terrible stigma types attached to the brand at the moment. 
A masked gunman holds a gun up to their hostage's head.  They demand that the negotiator shoot a random person or they will kill their hostage.  The negotiator refuses.  The gunman shoots the hostage.

Who is to blame for the hostage's death, the Gunman or the Negotiator?


The masked gunman.  If you're thinking this is smart allegory, you're wrong.  This is hardly how you can characterize what's going on in Congress.  I invite you to try to help me read between the lines in a reasonable fashion.

It's also non-responsive to the actual point of my post.  My complaint is that offering to fund the government for 2.5 months in exchange for delaying Obama's legacy legislation is a stupid negotiation tactic.  If House Republicans had said instead - "hey, we'll fund the government for the next year and we'll raise the debt ceiling sufficient for the next year's debt in exchange for delaying ObamaCare" - that would be a reasonable offer. 

PS - I tried to put this into your little story but it's impossible because it makes no sense.
It's actually pretty darn good.   It's really hard to come up with a hostage scenario where the hostage taker is the good guy.  That's why this is a good example of bad leadership.  Tea Party Republicans have put the Republican Party in the position of a hostage taker.  Try convincing the public at large that the hostage taker is really the good guy and the negotiator who's asking to put the gun down and talk is the real evil one.  That kind of thinking only exists in people who are radicalized, like the Tea Party.  

So now we are watching Republicans hold the budget hostage.  The news routinely calls hostage takers "cowards".  And now everyone is reminded of the shutdown in the 90's, which was widely blamed on Republicans.  

So, it is far more complicated.  But it doesn't LOOK complicated to voters.  It's these Tea Partiers that are driving moderate Republicans to become moderate Democrats and steering the party further off the cliff.
I'm still confused about your analogy but I apologize for my sharp tongue.  I agree that Tea Partiers are driving the party off the cliff.
I think we're in agreement.  I was posing the analogy as how the current situation appears to the general public.
The GOP is like a suitcase full of toxic waste forever circling on a baggage carousel at some third world airport. It's only attraction would be to someone stupid, angry, or desperate enough to pick it up.

After a year of Obamacare, the flaws will all be visible and the right can say, we told you so and will win most of the 2014 elections so even if the democrats get their way, it's only for now. 
And its completely true, given that the votes for the Senate's clean CR to pass the house exist. The Dems can, and will, wait Boener out.  
My dad works for a big health insurance company and he tells me that all the time, "Obamacare" is going to fail miserably. Premiums are going to be much more expensive than anticipated, etc., etc...
[deleted]
Out of curiosity, what does you dad say in response to the several media reports of cases where premiums were actually much lower? For example, last night on NPR a woman was interviewed who states her high deductible insurance plan went from $600 a month to $100 a month. She stated that she did not have insurance before due the high price of premiums. She will now as the $100 a month is feasible.

He sounds more like a president that had his government shut down through immature and controversial methods.  
I'm ok with this.
Nope. In the '12 elections he said at a debate: "I kind of like that name".
Subsidies?
Well the issue is a question of sustainability. Is obamacare sustainable giving out such low cost health care?
It's very possible. 
Not sure on sustainability to be honest. 
"Low income earner who is getting gov't. subsidy"

Then I asked who's considered a low income earner and he responded

"100% to 400% of federal poverty level"
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0&amp;feature=related

seriously though: the law has been passed. let it implement instead of trying to block it and fucking our economy to hell and gone. if what your dad says is true and comes to pass, won't it be super easy to repeal it?
yea between $11,000 and $46,000 are people who definitely don't need help from the government. You can get a ton of healthcare in that price range, advil is only like $15 a bottle, and that stuff works for literally everything.
Well, if you insist.

After 5 years of Obamacare, when it has a 58% approval rating compared to private insurance and HMOs, the GOP will start referring to it as the AMA again.
You think the "I told you so" of Obamacare is going to turn into Republican advantage? I'm pretty sure shutting down the government is what's going to cause Repubs to *lose* whatever advantage they have just like the last time.
The rest of the developed world has been on a similar system for the last 20 years...
Prove it.

Woah dude, you just divided by zero. Teach me how to do that.
*ACA
Funny, I work for a stop loss provider and they say the same, but only for the short term. It could also mean much better business eventually for everyone and the premiums will most likely stabilize.

Perhaps if the impact was not over-sensationalized, then this wouldn't be an issue.
Why are these graphs all acting like Obama and Reagan had the same exact starting points for each category?  More than a little misleading. 
&gt; Why is it a reasonable negotiating tactic to offer two months in exchange for what Obama sees as his legacy?

Hint:

It's not.
We need a rule like Australia has. Don't want to do your job? Fine. You're fired.
Thank you, phone typing gets me constantly.
Wait what's the overreaction here? The fact that Americans are upset that a public event within our own country turned into a let's stomp the president party. Or is this columnist overreacting by getting worked up that one person near to the administration who is from Missouri simply said it wasn't the states finest day? I mean unreal this columnists outrage is aimed at that tame sentence not a fair that turned into an antiAmerica rally. 
Perhaps we could limit election finances to a public fund and disallow direct private contributions; any contributions would be divided equally among candidates.
GOP continues to amaze us.
The problem is more along the lines of today's GOP can't hold Reagan's jock. 
What does he base this on? 
Of course he does. He's getting credit for the healthcare plan Mitt Romney first implemented in Massachusetts. Why wouldn't he want his legacy cemented with an eponymous title for his signature legislation?
The rest of the world spends less than we do per capita on healthcare already. The ACA will only increase our government healthcare spending above what it is now. I understand there's a huge problem with heathcare cost-structuring in the US, but the ACA isn't the solution...

Yet instead of waiting to see if they're right, they decide to shutdown the government before they actually have any evidence.
A Non-story about nothing
Paying members of congress less, while it sounds good, has an unintended consequence: only men and women of means will be able to enter public service.

Think about it for a minute.  Congressmen make 176,000 per year and have to maintain a residence in their respective districts as well as have a place to live when Congress is in session.  Assume a wife and 2.5 kids at home and you suddenly see that this money doesn't go as far as most of us think.

I love the idea of increasing the number of representatives.  I think that would have the added benefit of decreasing the amount of money each member of Congress would have to raise to compete for office as well as give better representation to the people.
I like how OP was attempting to make a point about how the president is wrong when really the president is right. HA HA CHARADE YOU ARE OP
So... what of all of the people who maintain a house with a wife and kids who are on minimum wage? Are you telling me that people who flip burgers and stock shelves can't be congressmen? 
No. What I'm saying is that we want a system where people who earn minimum wage can be members of congress. 

Unfortunately, I think we haven't had that system for a very long time. It costs roughly a million dollars to run a congressional campaign before we discuss all of the costs I mentioned above and the barriers to entry seem to get higher every cycle. 
Most criticisms of the ACA are about the requirement for everybody to have health insurance, and the requirement for companies with &gt;50 employees to provide health insurance to their full time employees.

The former mandate is seen as a perversion of the free market and a stab at one's liberty to obtain healthcare in any manner they prefer. This is the part that was specifically challenged in Supreme Court.

The prospective negatives of the latter mandate are:

1. A coupling of employment and health insurance, which can create problems when a person loses their job, and can lessen the influence of the consumer on their health insurance choices.

2. Increased burden for small businesses.

3. Splitting up of full time positions into multiple part time positions to avoid having to pay for the employees' healthcare.
There shouldn't BE barriers to entry is the point. 
[deleted]
I am not a Rebuplican. I just do not like the ACA. The ACA is a lot different than single payer, though. I would probably be cool with single payer.
If the requirement is for companies with &gt;50 employees, how is that a burden on small businesses (by my understanding from what you said, it wont affect small businesses).

And to me I guess I look at it kinda like auto insurance. Everyone is required (by law, doesn't mean everyone does) to have auto insurance if they have a car. I guess if you look at it like you can choose *which* place to get your auto insurance then you have more freedom that way, but I also understood ACA/Obamacare to have options for you as well (different deductibles, etc.)

And lastly, some minor complications for some businesses that meet requirements arise, but isn't that worth it if healthcare becomes a viable thing for 15-20 million more people (I'm using that number because I've seen/read/heard it around so that's what I'm going off of).

I just took the time to sign up on the website and everything and looked at some of the costs. They seem to range from as low as $85/mo to $350/mo (based on myself). If I was getting auto insurance, I'd expect that to be just about the same, maybe a little lower, but I haven't had a car in a few years so don't quote me on that.

That doesn't seem like a "huge catastrophic failure worst-thing-that's-ever-happened-to-America" type thing to me. 
As a liberal, I also have complaints about the mandatory health insurance component of the ACA. The law is a blatant handout to the insurance industry instead of a single-payer option, but at least it's a step in the right direction as far as expanding coverage availability goes.
that's not what "bill of goods" means.
Already 300k workers moved from full to part time because of obamacare

This is what I gathered:

It's the law to get on Obamacare

If you don't get on Obamacare, there is a "penalty fee" you have to pay.

And this is the premise of "individual mandate", right? They are saying "Hey, you HAVE TO have this. If you don't get it, you have to pay a penalty."?
[deleted]
[deleted]
&gt;A coupling of employment and health insurance, which can create problems when a person loses their job, and can lessen the influence of the consumer on their health insurance choices.

Wasn't this already the case before the ACA was passed? Most Americans get their insurance through their employer and before the ACA, if you had a 'pre-exiting condition' you had very little chance of getting new insurance on your own if you lost your job.

&gt;Increased burden for small businesses.

96% of small businesses employ fewer than 50 employees and are exempt from the ACA. Moreover, their are tax incentives to employers who do offer insurance for employees.

&gt;Splitting up of full time positions into multiple part time positions to avoid having to pay for the employees' healthcare.

This could happen, but it is really speculation. Here's more random speculation that could be just as true: there are other costs to hiring more employees as part-timers. Scheduling, turnover and training are all costs that might end up outweighing the cost of providing insurance for your employees.

And why should these companies be permitted to shift the burdens of their employees health care to the American taxpayer, either through subsidized emergency room care?
If you blindly follow one party on every issue you are kidding yourself. There is no reason to not only stay right or left on all issues. 

I had an old English teacher who told me this saying, "There's my opinion, your opinion and the actual truth!"


I'm not even a US citizen. So don't worry, I'm not following one party.
Welcome to /r/Republican . Although this is a great subreddit, you will find more activity on /r/Conservative .

I found it funny you say right or left. For the rest of the world the US is right and ridiculous right.
 
The ACA is not a left wing idea. As it stands it is still right wing, just less right wing than what is currently happening.
I think you replied to the wrong person.
I don't know if you are talking to me? But I never brought up the ACA. 
I *try* to examine every issue that comes up from an entirely neutral standpoint. The 4 years I spent studying political science in college pretty much cemented most of the major stuff. 

Also, politics isn't math. There isn't always one solution. You are just deciding whose solution is most effective.
What is your opinion of the US Government shut-down?

I don't have your education insights, however, I do have the following opinions:

* Obama can not yield for any reason otherwise the Republicans will likely make a habit of this;

* Republicans want to undermine Obama-care, however health care was at the core of Obama's election campaign and the American people did vote on it!

What are your thoughts?
You should post in /r/republican.  Much more active.
Review Federalist paper #58
Sure seems like both sides care more about winning and losing these hypothetical games as opposed to actually doing their jobs. 
I dont think a single party can consolidate all the power for long

I think the Death of the GOP will usher in the dominance of the Democratic Party for a few terms but it will eventually break into sub groups
Are you disagreeing that the bill is not Obamas legacy or that he doesn't think that the bill that the media nicknamed after him is his legacy?

Really scraping the bottom of the scandal barrel, aren't ya?
Honestly I don't see how you can look at whats going on right in our government and do anything but be ashamed to be a republican or be a prt of that party.

Its sad that the "logical" party has become the side of the aisle with nothing but personal attacks and emotional biased to hurl as return arguments when presented with the facts.

They were never willing to default on the government's obligations. Dems knew this from the beginning.

[deleted]
Without a serial comma, that makes my opinion the truth.
You do realize the sequester budget was 70 billion under what the senate and house passed.

Democrats have already compromised.

Republicans have a majority in a house where they lost the election by over a million votes. 

That's not representative democracy, and you don't get to hold the economy hostage to refight political battles that you lost explicitly on the campaign trail.

Romney ran on repealing Obamacare and lost, that was our national referendum on it. 
Legalizing marijuana and prostitution. I really don't care what people do to their bodies as long as it's not hurting other people.

I'm really wracking my brain and trying to find something I agree with them on, it's pretty hard. I am against the surveillance state, drone war and such things but I see those as bipartisan issues when you've got Republicans like Rand Paul and Darryl Issa standing against such things.
You might have better luck posting in /r/conservative and /r/politics (basically /r/liberal).
I think the drug war is ill-conceived and counter-productive. I also support gay marriage.
You're probably right, I think I'll ask both questions at same time in /r/politics 
Edit:politics doesn't allow text posts, guess I'll have to divide it up again
I voted for amendment 64 (weed) in Colorado. As did most of my Republican coworkers. I was surprised how many of us did.


That's too bad. I think that's one of the problems with that sub. They insist on links instead of discussion. 
Gay marriage. I just don't care and the faster it's not a hot topic on the news, the better.
Abortion ,legalizing marijuana for medical use, I feel that the current system we have for the medical canabis system is abused easily. I think if we had a better system we could get the people who actually need the medicine the help they need and cut back on the people who take advantage of the system. 
I posted the study cited in the article to a few subs. The only one that was downvoted is r/truereddit. Go figure the one sub that calls itself intellectual is the one that can't handle it. But then they think insightful articles from slanted sources bashing conservatives/republicans/tea party is worthy content. I call them out on it constantly.
Post your question in r/politicaldiscussion. It is a subset of r/politics whereas a conservative view usually gets downvotes, but it is the text version of r/politics.

Now to your question. I don't think it is a matter of what do you agree with so much as what do we all have in common. My current job and my last job I found myself as a minority in the company, me being white. That led to some interesting discussions. What everyone involved found was as people we aren't really that far apart as to what the government should/would do for us. We all found that there is common ground we all share. 

The problem is the divisiveness of the politicians and the whole "team" mentality. The parties work for themselves more than they work for us. The use the divide and conquer method to bend the wills of the electorate to vote in their favor. That will continue and get worse until we, the people, put them in their places and remind them, forcefully if necessary, that they do in fact work for us. Harry Reid was the one who tried to remind the tea party caucus that they work for the government. That's just really fucked up that he thinks that way.

As for things the republicans are supposed to be against according to democrats that I "agree" with are gay marriage (instead of marriage everyone should get civil unions), drug laws, not wanting government spying on us, getting us out of useless wars that do nothing but earn a profit for the military-industrial complex and cutting the DoD budget (there is so much wrong in the country the money could be better spent on if they insist on spending it).
Enviromental issues, because moving forward in technology only makes us stronger

Gay marriage. I see this as a rwligious issue and has no place in our government.
Weed, legalize it. Gay marriage, let them be miserable to. Abortion, it's her body.
Evolution; it happened and is still happening all around the world, at a calculable rate for each species based on particular variables such as known mutation rate and rate of cell division and reproduction. 
No
I see a lot of people posting about the liberal views they have generally being:
gay marriage
legalizing marijuana

but the fact of the matter is, is that those are not liberal ideas...
In fact if you have those ideas you're going even further right, I'm talking about Libertarian (i know that sounds similar to liberal but its the opposite really) because the farther right you go the more individual freedoms you want people to have until you get to anarchy. The farther left you go the more power you're giving the government until you get to communism. The way you decide on wether it is a right idea or a left idea is you think does what that person do effect any of my rights? no, then let them do it!

From the originally posted blog/article "Again, the relationship is trivially small, and can't possibly be contributing in any way to the ferocious conflicts over decision-relevant science that we are experiencing." As well as "These effects are trivially small, &amp; if I sample 2000+ people it's pretty likely any discrepancy I see will be 'statistically significant'--which has precious little to do with 'practically significant.'" Both of these were neglected in the politico article and make me highly suspect of its intent.

With a p value of .05 the result is statistically significant (lower p value means the chance of this result being random are low), but with his sample size it is just not sufficient to make sweeping claims. Also, the correlation coefficient, r, is .05 as well meaning their is little to no strength to the correlation between the "scientific comprehension" test score and party identification. ([Source)](http://www.culturalcognition.net/blog/2013/10/15/some-data-on-education-religiosity-ideology-and-science-comp.html)
I'd also like to announce that at some point we'll begin taking the steps to ensure that the plan that was announced last year, and we'll start to be issued rebates from various foreign policy makers in due time, as well.
Only if we *lose*...
You have to have insurance; doesn't need to be from the ACA exchanges.

At this moment though, for yourself personally, you can stay on your parents plan (if it extends coverage to children) until you are 26.
It was downvoted because the article greatly exaggerates the findings.  In reality the sample size of the study along with the results pretty much make any findings not significant. 
I linked to the study while others linked to a story about the study. The story did well while the study did poorly. I found it very telling that truereddit pretty much rejected the study when they are all about "truth."


Oh I see, yeah that is really stupid of them.  But alas, it is reddit, and reddit loves to hate things. 
How is your Gay marriage position a "liberal view", exactly? The liberal argument is that gay marriage deserves the same protections and rights as straight. That necessitates government intervention in circumstances where gay marriage could be the catalyst for institutional prejudice, etc.
It gets better. There were two major points decided with the supreme court. Whether the mandate deserved to exist for healthcare and whether the government had the right to enforce it. Only the mandate passed but they found it is unconstitutional to enforce the law under penalty. This was put off until people start paying penalties in 2015. Basically a bark with no bite, they cannot legally impose a fine or penalty for not buying into Obama care. This is not something well known to the public left or right and would leave the whole system bankrupt in the red if realized and actuated on. Enjoy.

Health insurance in the US[edit]

In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed in 2010 imposes a health insurance mandate to take effect in 2014. In 2010, a number of states joined litigation in federal court arguing that Congress did not have the power to pass this law and that power to "regulate" commerce does not include an affirmative power to compel commerce by penalizing inaction. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the health insurance mandate as a valid tax, and thus within Congress' tax and spend powers.

In 2011, two of four federal appellate courts upheld the individual mandate; a third declared it unconstitutional, and a fourth said the federal Anti-Injunction Act prevents the issue from being decided until taxpayers begin paying penalties in 2015.[1][2][3] In 1994, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report describing an individual mandate to buy insurance as "an unprecedented form of federal action... The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States."[4]

Here's what [another Republican had to say...](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/10/24/government-secrecy-and-fear-why-edward-snowden-deserves-thanks-every-freedom/)
Judge Nap is a conspiracy nut and an all around lunatic. 
Nice ad hominem attack. Why don't you address the actual issue itself?

*A group of former American intelligence officials and whistleblowers has awarded National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden its top prize.*

*Snowden was presented with the Sam Adams Award from the group, which honors one awardee a year for exhibiting integrity in intelligence.*

Every country spies. The two countries Snowden went to, China and Russia, are huge culprits. China is the #1 country for internet spying. Snowden is a traitor.
I'm not sure how espionage on the part of those two countries would weigh into determining whether or not Snowden is a traitor or a whistle blower.
So you put Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, in the same class as China?
I think it does. Chances are they will either get the info or already have. The world can now single out the US for doing something it'd be insane to not do and which every other country that is capable of doing does to some extent. 
Nope. I never did that.

"Snowden also revealed that the NSA can hack into anyone’s mobile phone, even when it is turned off, and use each phone as a listening device and as a GPS to track whoever possesses it."  How can anyone be cool with this?
Those of us who don't don tin foil hats don't give a shit about what Judge Nap says. 
It was part of Snowden's expose, hate on Judge Nap all you want, he's just a messenger here who wrote an opinion piece relaying the information.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask for a source on this one. This sounds just as goofy as the theory about the [digital converter box](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AOSG-uIzOU). If the phone is on, then sure and quite frankly I have no problem with it. But if the phone's off it's off. 
You are right but: If the battery is out your phone is off. If it isn't it isn't off.
"By September 2004, a new NSA technique enabled the agency to find cellphones even when they were turned off. JSOC troops called this “The Find,” and it gave them thousands of new targets, including members of a burgeoning al-Qaeda-sponsored insurgency in Iraq, according to members of the unit."

And that was a decade ago.

They aren't really turned off, then. They're in a low power mode. 
The only way to fully de-power a modern cell phone is remove the battery.
Actually he's from a Canadian city that elected a muslim for a mayor twice.
And I am pretty sure both the President and Vice President retain the title even when they're not holding the office.
Quote from the article: 

" So,can we finally stop pretending that the left has a positive plan for the United States?Can we stop pretending that the president meant to do anything other than destroy a system he has hated since his socialist-influenced youth?Can we dispense with the unhinged rants about dog whistles and face up to the fact that conservatives have been right about this all along?Can we finally openly discuss that the left's own hatred and bigotry are largely to blame for where we are now,not just regarding ObamaCare?"
&gt; Can we dispense with the unhinged rants

I guess not.

Is the whole article this screechy and spittle flecked?
Ahhhhh.  . . . .truth and facts equal unhinged rants.  

Liberals are really having a tough time with this.

Truth:  Everything conservatives said about Obamacare is true.  That is that. 

In fact all Obama voters owe the rest of us a very humble apology.

Why does the Israel health care system, which is much like Obamacare, work so well?
There are no death panels.
Yes, because it can't be remotely turned on.  Nope, no one in the entire world (especially not a government agency with a large budget) has that technology. 
He could be better, politically, than Romney. But he's not in the same league as Romney leadership skills-wise. Few men are. 

If the 2016 nomination process was starting today it would be a battle between Cruz and Christie. Lots can happen between now and 2016, but I'd guess that those will be the two biggest players in that nomination process. 
Good news. He's not exactly Romney, but he's OK.
Since the republicans have problems with demographics, he would be a wise choice in 2016.
As expected!
I guess so. 

If the primaries were today it'd come down to Christie vs Cruz. 

I still like Romney, that guy was pretty special. We'll see what happens.
Romney was a good guy.
Apparently they were more effective than Ron and Rand Paul, who turned out to support his opponent on the eve of the election.
Ron and Rand tried to siphon off support from that Libertarian guy who wasn't much of a Libertarian anyways. If anything Ron and Rand's support backfired and just reinforced the negative views minorities had after hearing about that "rat" comment from Cuccinelli.
Ron's a has-been. His endorsement is worthless.
The sad thing is that if Cruz wins within the party, he gets smashed nationally. I think that regardless of what you think of Cruz or Christie, Cruz just doesn't have the bipartisan appeal.
The same was said about Reagan. You never know. 

I think Christie's the smarter choice, but anything can happen. 
Really does look like he's our only shot. I'm not looking forward to losing all of my guns in a boating accident.
Not to this Republican.
*I am
I'm a registered republican and I support medical marijuana. I'd even go so far as to support full legalization.

What I won't stand for is huge government spending millions of tax dollars trying to stop people from doing what they want to do if they are not harming anyone.

I'm glad you've been able to have this second shot at doing what you love. I wish everyone were so lucky. Best of luck to you in the future!
Also I'd like to point out you got more supporters in /r/republicans than in trees. Despite what reddit tells you 24/7 republicans are not the enemy. Real republicans just want smaller government and less taxes. If we could end the useless spending on anti marijuana enforcement programs, trials, and incarceration how much money do you think we could save? We could go after the real killers like crack cocaine that destroy entire neighborhoods and have no medical value whatsoever. Also we could stop Americans from funding the genocide in Mexico with the cartels and give those people a shot at life and liberty. If it was legal there'd be no reason to buy it from the cartel.
Is it hunting season now?  Make sure you wear orange if it is!
Quote:

 The Manhattan Institute just published an analysis of the ObamaCare individual policy insurance rates demonstrating the average cost will rise by 41% next year. The results are very similar to the 2009 PriceWaterhouseCoopers analysis that predicted insurance rates would rise by 47%. The biggest hikes will hit the young people,where rates willj ump by an average of 98% for men and 58% for women. Insurance rates will also increase for everyone who is healthy and for all males.
This might be true on /r/republicans but it does not necessarily apply to republicans in the general population. [According to Gallup, only 35% of Republicans support marijuana legalization compared to 65% of democrats and 62% of independants](http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=Politics). 




He's got the numbers to prove it and he's more conservative than the right wing likes to think he is. Christie is proof that Republicans can win the Latino vote and do better than &lt;5% of the black vote. 
He'd make a far better candidate than one of these Tea Party nutjobs.
Most of the tea party is just off their rocker crazy. Not all, but most.

I'm opposed to the pipeline because, at least the way I see it, it's just another stop-gap that's going to give us an excuse not to work as hard on renewable sources of energy. Yes, it would provide a lot of energy, but I feel like that money would be better spent trying to maximize the yield from safer energy that doesn't need to be blasted out of the ground. 

I think the world record for most efficient solar panel is almost 50% which is really amazing for a world dominated by fossil fuels. Think about what we could do if we needed that solar power, if it was a priority. I just don't think it makes more sense to spend all the money on an underground fracking setup, when we could be spending that cash on building super-efficient solar panels that could only be improved in the future.

&gt; Numerically speaking, according to Gallup, only a marginally higher percentage of Republicans reject evolution completely than do Democrats.

But wasn't it 100% of the candidates to the republican primaries? (A bit less if you indulge Ron Paul with some doubts)
This doesn't even scratch the surface of what's wrong with a lot of the party's thinking. You're making absurd assumptions about liberals and immigrants. You're harming the democratic process by ignoring a significant chunk of the population because they may not vote your way.
This is a terrible list. It's very stereotypical and largely inaccurate. You sound unnecessarily pedantic, as if you were previously someone's campaign manager.
100 percent disagree with the abortion one
100 percent disagree with you on that one. 
Are you retarded? 
100 disagree with both of you on that one. Pro-choice, but for very different reasons: a woman who wants to get an abortion is going to get an abortion, legal or not, which is why every third week you hear about dead fetuses in trash cans on the news. Let's at least give them a safe route (not government funded, obviously) so this doesn't happen, since they're doing it anyways. Also, you shouldn't downvote something just because you disagree with it

That's an awesome list.  The derp in here is astounding, lol.
50/50 agree and disagree with you. 

Entirely agree with the first statement, it is a rational and logical argument. Have an upvote. 

Secondly, if you don't downvote those who are wrong, they'll never learn. 


Hmm, fair point. Take an upvote for yourself.
Likewise :D 
1. Complicated. They need to stop trying to appeal only to the older generation. Most people under 30 approve of gay marriage and guaranteeing the basic necessities of life. Don't try to out-liberal the liberals, but don't reflexively do the exact opposite.

2. I think felons should have the option of voting if they are able to go a certain time period without offending and not all felonies should end voting rights. A murderer or a rapist is worse than some college kid who sold an ounce of weed.

3. Agree 100%

4. Soft power has been demonstrated to be far cheaper and more effective than hard power.
(disclaimer: not an American, I would probably qualify as a liberal in the US, but I would like to give my 2 euro-cents as I genuinely wish that the US republican party changes so that it can take a meaningful opposing side in all the things dems do wrong)

The problem with 1. is the same as with 3. To address these two points you will have to abandon the religious base, the base that allowed G.W. Bush to be elected and reelected. The whites support of the republicans has lowered as they became opposed to the religious position on several issues. 

I think that there are two roads for the reps: either stay religiously focused and embrace the minorities (minorities are usually more religious than whites and the trend is continuing) or abandon the religious rhetoric and indeed, focus on whites, especially on female electorate. 

This is however a choice that I fear the current direction will never have the courage to make, preferring to focus on the dwindling white, male and religious electorate.

About 2

&gt; Point out to them that in any other Western country a political party would be too embarrassed to support rule changes that make it easier for criminals to vote for them.

You can try this strategy, but know that this is not true. In France, prisoners are allowed to vote for instance and the latest law to make it easier (in 2009) comes from conservatives (most inmates are right-wing there). For some countries, as well as for the European Court of Human Rights, voting is a human right attached to the citizenship. I won't debate this point (that I consider minor) here, but know that the US opinion is not universal. 


About 4, yes, I consider that obvious and not sure why it is even debated amongst republicans. Some commentators suggest that the army is the only branch of the government that both party accept to fund without question and therefore making war is the thing that US makes the best. Doubling (intelligently) the funding of diplomatic actions would maybe make this change but could a consensus exist on this question for long enough for the skills and networks to build up?
Returns an error on one page one time does not equal website crash. One data point i.e. anecdote. This is what passes for journalism?
Is it cheaper for young people to pay the opt-out price?
It's still too early to tell. The enrollment numbers for Massachusetts spiked right before the deadline date to enroll. I suspect the same will happen once the individual mandate looms closer. 

General procrastination behavior  of humans I guess. 
What a bizarre video. It's conservatives and Republicans such as Rick Santorum who want a Christian theocracy and an America ruled by the Bible. Counter to that, liberals have long pushed to keep America secular, keeping the church and state separate.

Don't want a theocracy? Don't vote Republican, because look at all the theological-based legislation they have pushed for years, especially recently in states such as VA, and all over the Bible belt.

And right here is the GOP's biggest problem. It's basically two (or more) parties in an increasingly awkward coalition. Personally, I would LOVE it if the GOP jettisoned the religious right - but I imagine there are just as many Republicans who would be mortified by the idea.

Still, I'd be interested to see how many votes the party would pick up from independents versus how many it would likely lose in this scenario.
Christie or Rubio... Probably Rubio. I don't think anyone else can win, especially against Clinton (unless *maybe* something new emerges about Benghazi)
Christie, mainly because he's the best bet against Clinton, plus he drops a lot of the weird abortion/gay rights rhetoric that Rick Perry and Rick Santorum have. I don't think Rubio is a viable choice because being Cuban, he isn't a viable choice for 2016 mainly because he doesn't have the governing experience Christie has. Christie can really hammer Clinton over that.
Good point and very valid point, but interesting considering I'm not a Republican. I just find you folks interesting to watch from the outside.


Rand Paul, Christie is like my last choice but I'll vote for him when he wins the nomination eventually.
Christie. Seems like the best blend of govn't knowledge and traditional values.  
Christie is the obvious choice but I'm not sure if it is wise to run another New England governor when the last one was a dud.  That being said I can't really think of anyone else who would be a challenge to Clinton.  I like how he has built an aggressive image of getting things done.

Only until they break a leg and get a $20,000 bill. 
Isn't that about what it costs for people without insurance *now* if they break a leg?
Yes.

And many people get the bill, can't afford it, so don't pay it.

But the hospital already gave them the treatment, and spent a substantial amount of money in the process of giving that treatment. 

So since that person can't pay, the hospital must charge someone else more money for their treatment, to recover that expenditure.

If the person who broke their leg had been insured, that wouldn't have happened, and prices for everybody would have been just a bit cheaper.

Apply this to the more than 40 million Americans who don't have health insurance, and you can see how (*once people who had pre-existing conditions, who now have health insurance, receive treatment*) costs will be lower for everyone, for both healthcare *and* health insurance.

And perhaps there won't be 45,000 Americans dying every year from preventable causes, due directly to a lack of health insurance. 
So, with everyone paying in, wouldn't the bill be cheaper, even if you don't have health insurance? Or will it stay the same amount, because either way, the hospital is guaranteed payment of some kind?
Yes, hospital bills would be cheaper for everyone, including those who don't pay in.

But people not paying in and still using healthcare services would cause prices to be higher than they would be if they paid in.

So the plan only works if everybody had insurance.

Therefore, people must have insurance for the ACA to be successful. 

Hence, the mandate. 
New Jersey isn't New England
Ahh you're right.  "Northeast governor" then.
I don't like Christie and every other major player whose name is being thrown around is a teaparty loon. Are there any true Republicans that aren't brain damaged on the national stage anymore?

You should also point out that republicans shouldn't try to discourage and condescend on others for their political beliefs, and should be diplomatic without being judgmental. Liberals are guilty of this too which is why the credibility of both parties is questioned in the first place... 
Who needs that when we have the tea party?
&gt; At least 72% of Americans are white, and whites are more likely to show up at the ballet box. 

And the number of whites that vote conservative/Republican is *shrinking every year*.

&gt; If it's necessary for you to expand your electorate, don't focus on Hispanics,

Expand to whom?  More whites?  They are a shrinking demographic--you're aware of this, right?

&gt; The confrontational style of American politics means that liberals will support anything that makes it easier for ~~them~~ poor people to ~~win elections~~ vote.  

FTFY
I stumbled across this and can't tell you how grateful I am for your post. I am a liberal but I come from a very conservative family. I'm currently with an uncle of mine who is very conservative and we have been spending the weekend talking about things we have in common politically in an attempt to bridge the divide. There is much we all agree on and if we came together with our similarities it would be easier to move forward together. 
Cool, glad I could give you some support.  My family gets awkward when the party machines really start moving. Its annoying.

It really is. Especially when we agree on so much. It is like agreeing on the same thing but fighting over the spelling. 
This is a really great post. I especially like the point that neither side is inherently malicious. I feel like both parties try to vilify their opposition so much to the point that they try to make you choose between good and evil, rather than between two different sets of policies. 

As a conservative in a very liberal environment, I will try to more openly voice my support of gay rights, cutting military spending, and abortion rights. It's really wild how so many people, including me, allow politics to be a choice between two sides, instead of many choices between many different perspectives on many different, unrelated issues. 

Overall, this post is very refreshing next to the hard-line, fuck-all-democrats-praise-all-republicans attitude that I see a lot of the time on /r/conservative.  
Try being a moderate in an academic environment. 
Are you in college? I can kind of imagine. I spent two weeks at Brown University this summer for an academic program and met more opposition to my political views than anywhere else I've ever been. 
I used to work at a big university.
I've looked at a lot of your posts, as well as a lot of what others said in response to everything. I think what you've posted in many of the subreddits shows a lot of partisanship on both sides. I'm just glad a lot of them are limited to keyboard activism. It's a scary thought when rubes who think a christian theocracy should be implemented, or when a civil war is permissible.

I get downvoted here and other right wing subs when I point out that the only true conservatives in Washington are the tea party faction. This nation is in dire need of conservative leadership. The GOP has bought in to the idea that they need to be democrat lite to be relevant these days. This isn't Europe, our politics aren't the same as Europe and we don't need to follow the failed path Europe took and is now suffering under. Unlimited social spending has dug the hole Europe is in. California is a prime example of what our nation will end up as if we keep going down the road we are traveling.

The US doesn't want or need a left party and a center-left party as the opposition. That center-left party is what I see the GOP as these days, and this is from a person who cast his first presidential vote for Reagan. 
Wait, the California that currently sports a [budget surplus](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-12-11/california-democrats-draw-up-shopping-list-for-budget-surplus)?  

Last I checked the #1 Tea Party priority was reducing the deficit and the debt, and California has been one of the most impressive examples of that post-recession.
Well you need to look deeper into California and what they aren't funded for with the upcoming pensions they are obligated to pay.

Yea! Public unions!!
It doesn't change the fact that California has a budget surplus due to compromises from both parties' ideologies in order to do so.  Isn't this ideal?  Isn't the end goal of a *budget surplus* worth compromise from both sides?  

I still fail to see how California is the worst state model for a nation struggling to get out from mounds of debt.

Yet you didn't address the unfunded liabilities that California will be strapped with in the coming years.

A surplus now means as much as the fake surplus Clinton showed. Basically it doesn't exist in the long run and doesn't matter. Do you really think California can put back hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years to pay the public pensions? L.A. county has liabilities close to a billion dollars that will come due in the nest 10-20 years. A surplus today doesn't mean shit down the road.
No, no it doesn't and I agree with you that the pensions are a concern, as well as California's heavy reliance on the 1%'ers income taxes in lean business years.  Long term is absolutely a concern, but it's a helluva lot better than the $16 billion deficit the state was facing just over a year ago.

And it's also notable that California is doing this while *increasing* education spending.  Regardless of what side of the aisle you sit on regarding minimum wage and tax cuts, economists pretty much universally agree that education spending is a key metric to reducing income inequality.  

There's no "silver bullet" to budget planning, but there's no denying that California is at least on the right track to getting stable (evidenced by their recent credit rating upgrade).  Yes, the long term is still entirely uncertain, but better to build upon a "fake" surplus than a massive deficit.

Again, I still fail to see how California is the worst state model for a nation struggling to get out from mounds of debt.

This is perfect. Please for the love of everything, stop clinging to the lost hope that the GOP establishment sellouts are going to turn things around. We're only making things worse by pretending we're putting people in Washington who care about small government and liberty when in fact they stand for the exact opposite. 
Thanks, exactly correct. Glad someone gets the point of the essay.
I think you're putting the cart before the horse. The GOP hasn't changed to become more like the Democrats, the Democrats have become more like moderate Republicans. 

So now we have a center-right party and a party split between centre-right and far-right constituencies.

It seems to me that your political scale has some skew to it. Try visiting some [centrist subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/centrist+moderatepolitics+NeutralPolitics+peoplesparty) to recalibrate. 
Are you really under the delusion that the democrats are center right? 

Best joke I've heard in a while. 
It's no joke, "Liberal" President Obama passed a healthcare plan almost identical to the [Heritage Foundation plan](http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/assuring-affordable-health-care-for-all-americans) that Republicans proposed as a counter to [Hillarycare in '93-'94](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993). The single-payer option (also known as socialized medicine and favored by Liberals both in the states and abroad) was never even on the table when the Democrats unilaterally approved Obamacare in 2010. 
That tired line again? Really? The individual mandate was proposed by the Heritage Foundation and nothing much else in the ACA even resembles their plan. Their plan also didn't gain much support so it never went anywhere but away. Comparing the ACA with the Heritage plan is apples and oranges and nothing more than a poor excuse to pin a failed plan on republicans. 
I've had this exact argument in this subreddit before. See: http://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/1ov780/dave_ramsey_says_everyone_will_pay_for_obamacare/ccw6l0o 

&gt; Comparing the ACA with the Heritage plan is apples and oranges and nothing more than a poor excuse to pin a failed plan on republicans.

[The author of the Heritage Foundation healthcare plan made that same claim, but was unable to substantiate it.](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-02-03/health-individual-mandate-reform-heritage/52951140/1)

&gt;But the version of the health insurance mandate Heritage and I supported in the 1990s had three critical features. First, it was not primarily intended to push people to obtain protection for their own good, but to protect others. Like auto damage liability insurance required in most states, our requirement focused on "catastrophic" costs — so hospitals and taxpayers would not have to foot the bill for the expensive illness or accident of someone who did not buy insurance.

&gt;Second, we sought to induce people to buy coverage primarily through the carrot of a generous health credit or voucher, financed in part by a fundamental reform of the tax treatment of health coverage, rather than by a stick.

&gt;And third, in the legislation we helped craft that ultimately became a preferred alternative to ClintonCare, the "mandate" was actually the loss of certain tax breaks for those not choosing to buy coverage, not a legal requirement.

All three of these points are distinctions without difference to the Affordable Care Act. 

1. Mandating insurance coverage provides *both* protection for the insured and ensures that they are not a financial burden on the hospitals from which they receive care. They are two halves of the same coin, you don't get one without the other. 

2. The health credits/vouchers described in this plan are more or less indistinguishable from the subsidies offered under Obamacare. If anything, Obamacare is even more conservative as the only persons eligible for the subsidies are those skimming close to the poverty line.  See point 3 for the stick to accompany this carrot 

3. I shouldn't really need to explain this one. The difference between a tax penalty for being uninsured and the loss of a tax break under the same circumstances is purely semantic. 
How about you go argue you liberal bullshit in one of the liberal subs where you belong?

Yep. Just like previous Republican nominees George W Bush and Mitt Romney, only Christie can easily show this side of himself to the public. He's a great political talent.

My main problem with the Tea Party is that is basically acts as a going-out-of-business sale for the baby boomers. In many respects, the platform boils down to "We ran up a huge bill giving ourselves handouts that we can't afford to continue to give our children, now we want to cut everything *except* handouts that go to old people!". 

They're the ones who ran the damn bills up; I for one would like to see them help shoulder the load when it comes to deficit reduction.
You. I like you. 
So Ellis promises to be like the entire rest of Congress. Awesome!
Only that this would mean the end to the Republican party AND the Tea party. Spliting parties means splitting vote, and that means no chance to ever get a majority again...
Blame first-past-the-post voting and the two party system. 
Something that actually hurts every party equally. If you look back a few years democrats had similar problems, it's just that the republicans are dealing with it right now.

But i agree, the voting system desperatly needs an overhaul. 
&gt; But i agree, the voting system desperatly needs an overhaul.

Everyone agrees to this, except those who can change it.
Kick them both out and fill it back up with libertarians and conservatives.
I don't think that's true. I think some people in all brands want to change it. The system and the culture of goverment is just not set up to do so easly.

And then there are also those who purposely hinder any change.
Well thank god you're here, so that way I don't feel alone on this.
Considering that the Tea Party is doing more to hurt the center right, which outnumbers them by far, I'd rather see the Republicans lose a couple of elections nationally than let the Tea Party continue.
The Republican party would be out for good. Not being present in media as often, due to lack of influence and political power/relevance means you loose votes left and right. Combine that with the inablity to do anything against it...

 Another problem with a two party system is that it is very fragile.
It wouldn't be out for good. It would be out for an election cycle. Look to the 1912 election. Republicans then learned that you couldn't have a fractured base. Today's Republicans seem to have forgotten that, from Ted Cruz's no compromise policies to Jim DeMints funding of Tea Party primary upsets. It isn't sustainable to be a minority party AND to refuse to be bipartisan. I think Republicans need to continue to lose elections until either the Tea Party is out, or at least learns to compromise.
&gt; And then there are also those who purposely hinder any change.

Sort of my point. Why would those currently benefiting from the way the system is set up want to change it if they didn't have to.
Ryan would be the most "on the issues" contest. Christie is all personality, Huckabee and Santorum are all side issues, Perry is just try to overcome his goofy campaign. 
And if it's a Fox News poll, you know it's fair and balanced!

Looking at the photo of Eisenhower with George Bush, the man was a spitting image of his father. 
&gt;In March the Republican National Committee published its analysis of why the party lost the 2012 presidential election and what it needed to do in order to win again. “We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people,” it read, but “we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.” 

You see this one everyday on republican and conservative subs.  If you deviate even slightly from the orthodoxy, even just to point out a factual error, you are liberal retard.

I'm sure there will be quite a few running. Cruz and Christie are the more "serious" contenders IMO right now. Potential candidates include Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker. Even Rand Paul seems primed to continue the family tradition of running for President and losing terribly in this upcoming presidential election cycle. 
[deleted]
A lot of redditors probably think I'm crazy but I think Ted Cruz has a chance to win the presidency. Just as good a chance that Obama had in 2006 IMO. 
[deleted]
Lol 
I'm not sold on Jindal's leadership abilities, but his heart is in the right place. He's quite a bit more socially conservative than I am, which puts him over on the right wing. IDK if he'd be electable! 
Christie is the better choice.
Out of those two absolutely. Out of everyone likely to run I would probably choose Jeb Bush over Christie. 

Most of the tea party clowns might as well not bother running. Rand Paul probably is planning to run with no intention to actually win, but Cruz is one to watch out for. His resume, while lacking executive experience, is stronger than Obama's was. Overall he's a very bright guy just about as smart as Romney, but instead of going into business he's focused his career on things related to conservative activism. He's been making moves to solidify his support with the activists, something no Republican has had much of since Bush in 2000. If he's nominated the problem with the Republican voters who stayed home won't happen again. Cruz is the only tea party guy I can see actually having a decent chance to win the nomination, and from there the presidency is in reach. 

Christie has proven he can solve the "demographic problems" the Republicans have been having lately, though. It seems a Christie ticket with Susana Martinez as the VP is a strong possibility. 
 Christie/Bush would be a great ticket.


Since jobs and the economy are recovering significantly I think it's still a good fight. 
He would be best, but the name carries a lot of baggage.
Can you point the articles/news out? I didn't see anything during the election that targeted him specifically.

Not surprising. He's a divisive figure.

People who thought he was an asshole or RINO liberal shill before still do

People who thought he was great before still do.
Cruz is a delusional hypocrite and his retinue of Tea Party bootlickers is too blinded by their self-righteous populist hate to see it. 
Upon migrating to the United States many years ago,I embraced my new home and left the past behind. Never could I imagine that,at some point,that past would become relevant.

But now,I am compelled to talk about it again.

&gt; Now, most American news sources are no different than Pravda and Izvestia.

Holy hyperbole, Batman!

Of course, there are some differences between the UK system and the US systems. The UK has a single-payer system - the government makes the decisions as to what is covered and how treatment will be alloted. Then they pay for it. The consumer's only inputs into the system are to request treatment, and to vote for politicians who push for the level of care the voter wants available. 


In the old US system (prior to Obamacare), private insurance companies providing the coverage were making the policy decisions on what care will be covered, and the insured individual, their families, and their doctors are making the decision on what care will actually be provided.

Under Obamacare, the government mandates a certain minimum level of coverage, but beyond that, the same insurance companies are still making the policy decisions on what to cover and patients, families, and doctors are deciding on care.

Basically, all this crap about death panels? Yeah, the people on those panels don't work for the government. They work for your insurance company. If you don't like a particular company's policies, buy insurance from a different company. 

tl;dr: Yes, socialized medicine sucks ass. Fully agree. Applied to Obamacare, this "socialized medicine" argument is patently absurd. It serves only to demonstrate that the people making it have no clue what they're talking about. Posted here, this argument is nothing more than an embarrassment to Republicans and fodder for Democrats. 
Yes
[deleted]
Yes, I agree, but maybe not in the way you think.

The republican party needs to step away from the social issues. Let gay marriage happen, but it still isn't a federal issue even if the democrats want it to be. They need to move to the personal freedom point of view concerning marijuana. They can't spout off about the NDAA and the NSA but not allow a 10th Amendment issue such as marijuana laws to be left up to the states, same as with abortion. Federal law concerning abortion is already set, let the states has out the rest via the 10th.

The republicans in Congress now have no spine and most of them are democrat lite. The tea party (true conservatives in my book even though I'm not entirely on board) has to be doing something right is they have the republican establishment attacking them too. We don't need a republican party, we need a conservative party who backs up their rhetoric.
In the short term the GOP needs to die, it's going to happen sooner or later and the faster it happens the faster it can return with a new brand of conservatism. 

I'm a centrist Canadian, so you can guess where my meaningless support lies, but I have personal experience with one party government. No matter who is in charge they suck. If the republican party stays on it's current course they are guaranteeing a long and stable democratic dominance.
Specific examples of issues would help, but if you're talking about abortion, I think many Republicans simply don't want to kill babies. 
“If the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control, because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government, then so be it,”

So he's saying that Women have priorities other then birth control, and that the government providing it should not be the central issue for them. Just the way he says it implies that women who are assisted by the government in getting birth control are a bunch or horny sluts who can't keep their legs closed.




And the whole thing about legitimate rape from a few years ago.

It's really just all part of the Republican/conservative mindset of low government interference. It' doesn't just apply to women; some women just happen to have an issue that they feel the government should help them with, while Republicans generally believe that the government should back off as much as possible.   
I understand that, It's the tone I don't get. 

"they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system " is what people hear when what he was trying to get across was "government providing it should not be the central issue for them."

It's not a media distortion that it happened that way. If he hadn't said that last bit it wouldn't have been controversial.

While I sharply contrast on the gay rights issue, being a gay republican myself, I also, being a realist, understand that the Republican Party would prefer not to risk letting the religious right walk out on them and launch a third party bid.

Now I don't know about your accusation about "Democrat lite" and I would be grateful if you would provide an example. I also think it would be wise to consider where these Republicans come from. If they're from Maine or Mass. then clearly they won't be very conservative, but on critical votes they would do wonders. I think the tea party has it's heart in the right place, but primary upsets in battleground states are doing much more damage than the Democrats could ever hope to do. We need a Republican Party the appeals to more than tea party primary invaders. Rhetoric is all well and good, but it won't do us service in places like Ohio, Florida and Virginia. 
They're not.  Married women tend to vote Republican.  It's the single women that vote Democrat, and they're the ones more likely to respond to the "War on Women" crap and care about issues like 'free' birth control and on-demand abortion.  Married women care more about things like providing for their family, so economic issues tend to dominate their voting decisions.

Everybody except straight white wealthy male Christians, sure.
To those who will come in here saying he just doesn't get it, I propose that he knows precisely what he is/has been doing.  More punishment for business means that the wealthy, instead of creating jobs, make their money elsewhere.  They still get wealthier.  A growing number of unemployed people means more people who depend on the government, which means more votes for democrats.  The elimination of the middle class is the ultimate goal, and this president has done more towards this end than has taken place in the past 200 years.

Wow this is what Obama calls affordable? What a lie.
He wants to continue the Bush tradition of sending young Americans overseas to die in pointless, counterproductive excuses to increase military spending. Just the guy we need. Lol
Yeah yeah, Caffe. I know you'd rather have that white supremacist conspiracy nut Ron Paul (or his son, Rand) elected than pretty much any other Republican. Thing is all that white supremacist stuff is enough to disqualify one from winning the Republican primaries. Of course it's an even bigger deal in the national elections. 

Jeb's a smart move. As far as the hard-right goes, Ted Cruz is obviously a far more sensible choice for a nominee than Rand Paul. 
Do you ever wonder why you are so obsessed with race? You are the most racist person I know. 

To most decent people, race just doesn't come into the picture. Of course if you're a Zionist, its all about race. They want to make citizenship dependent on race. Why don't you talk about that?
Don't turn this around on me, pal. Ron Paul is the one with the racist history, not me! 

I have no idea about Israel mandating citizenship based on race. That would surprise me considering they've famously taken in many black Ethiopians. Are you sure that's a serious proposal in Israel and not something bound to go nowhere? 

I'm an American so it makes perfect sense for me to be on the lookout for American racists like Ron Paul. 
Racism is stupid, in the USA it is the refuge of the ignorant, be they black, white, Jewish, Arab or Ainu. It gets a lot of attention because the powers behind government and media like it that way. But please notice that a real responsibility of Americans as regards race and nationalities is ignored by you and your clan. If the Jews deserve their ancestral land, why don't the Lakota people. They were promised the Dakotas by treaty signed by the US Senate. Where is your outrage about the way that native Americans have been disenfranchised. 

Methinks that your race crusade is focused on certain races and therefore is itself very racist. 
If you think racism is so stupid why are you such a strong supporter of Ron Paul? Your bullshit doesn't add up, Caffe. Try it on some ignoramus. I don't buy it. 

The Jews don't have their entire ancestral homeland. They've given much of it up in the name of peace. No one is trying to destroy the Lakota people. This is 21st century America! They still have their reservation and relative autonomy. Of course I'm not defending any of the wrongs which were done by settlers largely in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

Methinks those Lakota tears from you are just a desperate attempt to deflect criticism for you being such a strong supporter of a white supremacist politician. 

BTW I've got something interesting cooking in the anti-racist department. Stay tuned, it's gonna ruffle some feathers. ;)
Ron Paul may be a racist, but I doubt it. If he were it would have no bearing on his economic and military policies. Those are what attracts me and anyone who doesn't have your sick racist obsession to Dr. Paul. 

I am sorry I entered into this conversation. Conversing with you is an unpleasant exercise in futility. 

Ciao
Ron Paul is irrefutably a racist. The fact that he's a huge racist is not up for debate. His economic and military policies are rooted in hate and paranoia. 

If you want to have a more productive conversation I suggest you post honestly next time, Caffe. 

I hope you and your family are enjoying your summertime down there. 
GOP is digging deep because they're scared to death of Rand Paul.
I bet they are scared of him but not for the same reason you think they are. A Rand Paul nomination would essentially be handing the white house to the Democrats in 2016.
&gt; They want to make citizenship dependent on race. Why don't you talk about that?

Because it isn't true.  Citizenship will be dependent on nationality.  Like how a child born in the United States of a father who is a citizen of India and a mother who is a citizen of the United States is automatically entitled upon application to citizenshit in India.  (This holds true for Germany and many other countries).


************

I'm sure you've seen this before &lt; Insert 'Right of Return' module &gt;:

* Right of return - The following countries also have laws relating to dual nationality / right of return for people of the respective ancestry (while not for people born in that country of non-national parentage): Ireland (upon Ireland attaining independence in 1937, its Prime Minister, Eamon de Valera, was a US citizen who had been born in New York), Greece, Russia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland, Poland.

Other countries that allow a right of return for the children of citizens born in a country other than that in which the parent is a citizen include India.

For a list of countries that allow right of return, refer to the Wikipedia entry on "Right of return".


I don't know whether Ron Paul is a racist.  What I do know is that since 2008, almost every racist that I've encountered on the internet has been a strong supporter of Ron Paul, which is not to say that every strong supporter of Ron Paul is a racist.
If Ron were not a racist he would not have defended his newsletters, only to change his position in a national election. That's all you need to know about Ron other than he is a favorite of Stormfront.
The Bush family is a major player in the Republican Party. No digging necessary, he's a natural to be considered as a front runner. A top 3 choice for the nomination.
In the great events and challenges of our day: wars, government abuse of myriad types, stagnant economy destroyed by the Central bank, etc. I really cannot think of anything that could be less important than a couple of newsletters from 15 years ago. 

It is the only thing that you trolls have on Ron Paul, and it is nothing. 

Also I love the way that you support one of the only countries in the world with institutionalize s prejudice against one group of people. You are the world champion hypocrites. 
Isn't that cute?

Nationality means being a citizen of a nation state everywhere in the world... Except Israel, who gives itself the right to redefine nationality as being someone who calls himself a Jew (and is politically acceptable to the Israeli state)

The whole thing is bullshit. 
His ignorance of most issues also turns me off. 

From the election results, a 3 time loser, apparently I am not alone.
His military policy of minding our own business is rooted in hate. Lol!

All of his program is rooted in love and anyone, everyone is welcome 

Now go justify the Israeli murder of 400 unarmed civilians in Cast Lead again. 

He's a conspiracy theorist! He wants to withdraw the military from around the world because he believes that the US military is a major part of the globalists' dastardly plan for eventual one world government. 

Caffe, I don't think you're as stupid as the stuff you've posted today would otherwise suggest. I implore you to post honestly about Ron Paul. 
LBJ was a bit of a nut, but also one hell of a politician. If not for Vietnam, he'd be venerated (at least by the left, although his civil rights legislature should win plaudits across the spectrum)
&gt;Isn't that cute?

Isn't what cute?

&gt; Nationality means being a citizen of a nation state everywhere in the world... Except Israel ...

Not true, caferrell.  I would point to the many people who considered themselves to be Armenians, even during the time that Armenia was not a nation-state.  I point to the Romani people.  I point to the Cherokee.  I point to the Lakota.  I point to the Berber people.  I'll even point to the Palestinian people.  There has never been an independent Palestinian nation-state.  According to the logic of your statement "Nationality means being a citizen of a nation state everywhere in the world... Except Israel..."  There is no such thing as a Palestinian people.  You aren't saying that, are you?

Throughout history, nationality has often been independent of a nation-state.

&gt;The whole thing is bullshit. 

And you are so well spoken. Your mother must be a proud woman.

Is it? Really?  Just because you don't like something, doesn't make it that.

I'm relatively in the same boat as you.  I've voted both ways, god forbid, based on which party is least worse in the current race.  

Consider the below with an open mind.

Both Parties are currently Statist as opposed to Federalist.  I want more efficient and smaller governemnt, but I also believe in entitlements to a certain level.  But the Government has never gotten smaller, it's growth is slower, but never negative.

Both Parties have severe conflicts when it comes to the Power over Life and Death.   Who holds the power over Life and Death?  In practical terms, how is Abortion supported by the same party which is Anti-Gun?  Why aren't individual gun rights supported by the same party which supports the right to choose?  Like wise, why is the party which is Pro-2^nd Amendment anti-Abortion?

Why are the republicans clutching so desparately to the Southern Strategy?  We need immigrants.

Both parties seem to have a collection of positions that have been curated to get votes, and not by a coherent ideology.  The ideology follows the strategy and only as a moral justification, and not in a consistent way.

That said, the acrimony is precisely because the Parties are in fact quite similar.  This is why the differences are hyperbolic, there are so few of them, especially on big issues, that there is no room for compromise, because one slip up will make you seem like the other side.  These wedge issues become a no-man's land where you'll get shot for attempting to cross.

Once anyone leaves the Rank and File, it's impossible to find any kind of satisfaction with either Parties' Establishment, and the Estrablishment candidates (Progressives currently dominate Democratic Party, for example) get the most support, especially at the National level.  With the Republicans, however, one must go as far Right as possible to win the Primaries, but then reverse tack and head back left, mean-while your Pimary run-up will be used against you by the Democrats.  


Addressing corruption and money in politics, I personally agree because I'm a Federalist. I'd love to starve the goverment and make it smaller because it is full of people who are power and money hungry.  That's a massive issue with Government; the people who seek those jobs are the people you don't want in them.  I want them to be administrators, wielding as little power as possible.  but at the same time, it's hard to do that without hurting people who require Government Assistance.  There is no argument that things like unemployment insurance and medical insurance boost the economy.  If people have a safety net, we will have more people taking risks, and that's what we need in the small business sector.


When it comes to campaigh finance reform, i'm for it, because I don't like massive institutions having influence over the individual, be it Government or Business.  This is what a Federalist should believe, which just highlights that neither party is actually for the individual.  But I have otherwise intelligent friends, Democrats specifically, who truly believe what the NSA did was fine, and that the Government must act like a Nanny.  They have every right to that belief, and I think that's the majority.  As long as people believe the Government is always a force of Good (as long as their preferred party is in charge), they'll keep supporting it.  most people want Campaign Finance reform because of the corporate influence, but both parties massively benefit from this, so it's impossibly to get rid of it.  It's the worst moral hazard we have in this country in my opinion.  I'd love to hear more about how to do it if you have plans.  True Federalists will agree with you, so seek them out.  Same with Libertarians, even if it's for a moral justification which is against the reason you are doing it.  

I think what you are doing is the key, find people who have the same goal as you, *for whatever reason*, and reach out to them.  It would be great if we could vote that way.  Can we just get a direct vote on 2^nd Amendment issues?  Abortion?  Gay Marriage?  But that is frought with it's own problems.  

It's frustrating, for sure, but it's something I'm interested in.




I think it's completely possible but it requires millions of people to really look at themselves, and their beliefs, and understand that they aren't going to get everything they want. They have to be comfortable enough with their beliefs, and the beliefs of others to understand that it's not a VS. match, it's a co-op mission. 

I just read [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/02/05/the-media-make-us-think-were-more-polarized-than-we-really-are/) in another subreddit and it's absolutely true. It's not that the things most Americans want are irreconcilable, things don't change because the things that most citizens want are different than the things that Money wants. I'm sure that most Conservatives who have seen the actual numbers on income inequality in this country would agree that something has to change but every media source is able to throw out it's own cherry-picked data to support it's own ideas. 

The problem is that in order to change something like this, you have to get people to realize that they've been duped by a double-crosser whose been fanning flames on both sides for years. I also think it's only a matter of time. We're reaching a point in which the country is struggling to keep it's standard of living up and as soon as it begins really falling, the shit will hit the fan. 
&gt;But if I'm right... then why does it seem like we're 100% opposed to each other?

Because whenever I try to express my beliefs I'm called a racist, homophobic misogynist as the go-to reaction.

I think its both sad and hilarious not one person here on Reddit has taken the time to read this and comment on it, heads are in the sand, if it doesn't support a liberal way of thinking they pretend it doesn't exist...   sad.
No, they wouldn't, because that can't happen. I guarantee that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner happen to be smarter than some twit on Reddit who thinks that his data is valuable/important enough to collect through Obamacare, because apparently the NSA doesn't have enough money to do that already. We're common people in the sense that we can't subscribe to /r/conspiracy with a straight face, nor do we believe that an arbitrary technocratic method of governance that tries uplifting the current human condition is, or ever will be effective. We believe that modern American capitalism, which has been at work for the better part of 150 years, is the way to go. Considering where capitalism has taken us, it is by and large a better system than anything else in the world. I would also like to add, that if you were truly a good parent, you wouldn't plan on having kids while on handouts. But I understand that since you don't really have a moral foundation, being a technocrat, it isn't something the occurs to you naturally.
Who are the "whack jobs" you refer to? The religious? The tea party? RINO's? Who are they?

An interesting read but i feel like this article was poorly written. I understand the point the writer is trying to make, but the comparison feels forced and a bit of a stretch. I commend the princes for helping and they should be an example to public figures all over the world to come together and help. However, instead, I feel that this writer used their hard work, compassion, and charity as a pawn to show how the Obama's can be perceived as selfish. 

I'm not saying I disagree with the facts, I am saying that the article was vague and the point wasn't clear. Even the headline was worded poorly. 
Lol
It's disgusting that the more hatred and ignorance students have, the better their grades in college.

[The Amazon reviews for the book seem to have taken a hit.](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Social-Work-Welfare-Perspectives/dp/0495601683)
I certainly wouldn't characterize Reagan as a champion of gender equality, but I wouldn't applaud his record on that.  In the 80s women's liberation was still somewhat of a new thing for a lot of people, so much of that was just a product of the times.

*“The way it describes conservatives as viewing people as “lazy, corrupt, and incapable of true charity” is extremely offensive and beyond not true, granted the fact that conservatives believe that people are capable of succeeding without government interference,”* 

You had the freakin' *Republican candidate for president*, Mitt Romney, talking about how 47% of the country were takers and moochers.  That conservatives take that view is absolutely true.  Fox News the website apparently is unaware of the opinions that Fox News the TV network spouts on a daily basis.


*In the subsection of the text, titled “Conservatism,” the authors list three concepts as characterizing conservatives:*

* As opposing change and prefer tradition due to the fact that, “They believe change usually produces more negative than positive consequence.”
* As usually having a pessimistic view of human nature.
* That they usually “conceive of people as perfectly capable of taking care of themselves.”

I think all three of those are true, but the article just throws them out there, I suppose to create outrage.  But I don't see any refutation.
I wouldn't necessarily agree with everything said in this article..

However, I would have to agree it does describe the leadership of the recent Republican party quite well. Yet I don't feel it's accurate to whitewash all 'conservatives' as described.

I would have to agree that most people are capable of taking care of themselves, but the reality is that a lot of people can't for various reasons. For instance wounded vets, the disabled, the elderly, no jobs available, etc..

These people seem to get ignored in 'Conservative' arguments about what we should be spending money on as a nation. So even if it isn't a lack of caring, thats what it looks like from the outside.
because a "he said she said" tweet is a credible source? no, i don't think so

Adolf Obama newest crime against humanity.  Take the people's guns.  Use the government (IRS) to punish political enemies. Use the NSA to spy on the people.  Give the NSA even MORE power to spy on regular citizens.   Take total control of the health care system giving the GOVERNMENT complete ability to control who will and will not receive health care. Now the first steps to controlling the press.
I wondered how the Germany allowed Hitler to take such complete control so quickly.  Now I am seeing it happen before my own eyes.
yeah umm how about EVERYTHING
Imagine if Romney had even hinted as something close to this. People would be rioting in the streets.
Maybe it's just me, but I'm not sure what the issue is..

Doing a meta study like this seems like a no-brainer.

Well, the debate on global warming pretty much *has* to be politicized. The government feels as if it needs to be a part of our environment, and part of it is protecting that. 

So, if two parties, or people, can't agree that global warming actually exists, then we get down to a huge debate.

See, one wants to set a specific, usually very large, budget towards the prevention of pollutants, stricter energy and environment regulations, and a heap of other restrictions/regulations.

Now, if one side believes that global warming is real, they will want to create a budget to save the environment. However, if the other side doesn't believe in global warming, they don't want to spend so much money on something that could potentially be false.

There is much more to it, but that is the basis of it. Money is *almost always* the debate.
[deleted]
Because old energy companies have a lot of money to throw at campaigns. And new energy has some money to throw in too.
Yes. It is true, but I didn't come here to argue. I'm just questioning why, if someone is a Republican, they don't generally "believe" in global warming. It's also a popular belief among fundamentalist Christians--the majority of whom are Republicans. I know I'm speaking in generalizations here, but I don't understand the denial of it politically. Obviously, the money part of it makes the most sense, but it's just a silly thing to so vehemently deny when it is such a real phenomena.
That isn't the only science that Republican's don't believe.  Most people don't believe in [evolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/1yqvmw/why_is_global_warming_so_politicized/) for instance.  It is an interesting question.  It probably has something to do with an underlying selection bias.  The personality or type of person that is drawn to the Republican/conservative idealogy don't believe/accept/acknowledge the validity of the scientific method.  If you wanted to overgeneralize, conservatives believe in holding on to some idealized version of the past, in America the 1940's and 1950's (assuming that you were a white dude), while science is about exploring, the future and question assumptions.  If you are drawn to the past that might be scary so you are naturally resistant to science.  Then you can mix in the team sport aspects of current politics and you get the global warming situation.
I think you are missing the point of the question.  The question isn't over what the EPA should or shouldn't do about global warming.  The question is why, if you believe in small government (ie are a Republican) why don't you accept scientific evidence of global warming.  Even if you acknowledge that there is evidence of global warming, as a small government person you can think that an expansion of the EPA is not the answer.  The question is why one team rejects scientific inquiry on a number of issues.  There isn't any inherent principled reason to oppose global warming science.  If you believe in low taxes, you could substitute a carbon tax for payroll taxes on a 1 for 1 basis.  If you believe in a small government just have the tax enforced like sales tax at the point of sale, not a bunch of regulators and inspectors.  Republicans vote for sales, income and property taxes.  There isn't really just one tax that Republicans support and they oppose all the other ones. 
He wants to stay in the "frothy" mix. 
no offense but that is precisely NOT the point, but everyone assumes it is.  Most people tend to think about global warming and the solution to it as one entity and they are distinctly different.

Global warming is not a policy, and it has no business being politicized. Global warming is either scientifically proven or it isn't. What results from that research can be politicized. But the science can't and shouldn't. The policy should be based on the science and the science is pretty uncontrovertible. Theres like 12,999 research papers that say its real and 1 that says it isn't.  Where there is disagreement in science is over how bad it is, how and it will get and fast it will get that way.

Once we agree that global warming is happening and that human activity is in some way contributing, THEN the policy comes in to try to find out best to mitigate it. Is it carbon offsets? is it regulations reducing the permissible levels of pollutants? Do we ban CFC's (the stuff that used to be in aerosol cans) do we prohibit building in flood prone areas?

THIS is where different parties can disagree. On what to do about it. If someone is arguing that its not real, then they think they're smarter than a legion of scientists, researchers and people who went to college and got degrees and know a lot more than they will ever know. They're throwing their lot in the with one lone scientist who says its not true vs the the 12,999 who say it is and thats idiotic considering the stakes.

The right doesn't believe in global warming. they generally dislike science as a whole. The truth is that the right is a) intellectually illiterate, they literally don't understand what they're talking about, b) have a disdain for anyone who is smart and c) believe its some sort of a plot to I-don't-know-what. They  think its going to lead to one world government. or something oh and d) they're against any regulation of business which would almost certainly be part of any proposed solution.
You're not generalizing anything. You're honestly feeding off your hatred for crazy people and projecting your anger towards a group of people who have sensible and justifiable beliefs on what our nation should and shouldn't be.

Ax a republican who knows a SHIT TON of republicans, I only know a handful that actually spew out tea party bullshit. 

You must be hot shit for believing in evolution, global warming, and any other scientifically proven facts right? I'll let you in on a secret, a majority of republicans are actually quite sensible and thinks with reason. 

Your post on this subreddit is outright ignorant with a lack of any weight. Do you think it's right for people to basically typecast middle Easterns into the terrorist group? Oh you don't? Quite hypocritical of you indeed, cause that's what you're exactly doing. 

Again, you're ignorant as fuck, and you're just as bad as the tea party, Fox News advocates out there.
Hahaha...you and your constituents against the world, eh? If the Republicans you surround yourself with are so damn smart, then why is it that they allow themselves to be represented, to be figureheaded, by some of the most impractical people in all of politics?

I didn't come to this thread to get into an argument with a mouthbreathing name-caller, but as a bi-partisan Republican myself whose only real beliefs are "reality," I thought it a reasonable question.

You're attacking me and not answering the question. And what pisses me off the most is that I fought a war so that people like you could live in some paranoid world based on your own fear of everything that doesn't fit your description of what you see in the mirror each day.

Let me tell you this, not all billionaires need go believe in the shit you believe them. As long as they have more money than you and me, they can lobby the shit out of any congressman to reflect their beliefs. 

You'd be a moron to not spew out nonsensical bullshit for a million here and there. He'll, give me 10 million and I'll say that evolution is bullshit. 

It all depends on who controls the party, and what their agenda is. You should know that...

Bobby Jindal is a insignificant, disrespectful hack. It's embarrassing that the GOP can't keep its nasty little internal war in check long enough for a brief White House visit. 

&gt;Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy rose to challenge Jindal immediately after he spoke to reporters, calling his remarks on Obama waving a white flag “the most insane statement I’ve ever heard.”

The next time Bobby J wants to see the inside of the White House, he'll have to buy a ticket like the rest of the tourists. 
He can boost it right down the drain.

You do know that this government isn't the first to be controlled by the wealthy right? 

How can it be disturbing when history is basically repeating and running its course in a predictable fashion? 

Is it wrong? It's relative. Are you on the winning or losing side? If you're losing, then what are you doing to be on the other end? 

This is basically survival of the fittest, but people don't like that idea. 

Do you know what type of government looks the best on PAPER? Communism. The problem is that the government is being run by an ideology with mankind interpreting the rules and manipulating it based on human nature which is basically ruled by the instinct of surviving at a gain to their individual self. Capitalism is actually an ideology that speaks the truth of humanity, which is to basically a nation that runs on an individuals gain over others, whereas communism runs on a utopian world. 

My point with the statement above is that how can you be bothered by repeating history and, most importantly, those who to live a life that allows you to survive longer than others at whatever gain? You need To understand what ideologies your country is run by, and play the game. No point in bitching if you're not gaining anything from it.

ah the republican party. never fails to amaze me.
Because the previous administration's way of dealing with tyrant/bully Saddam worked so well....

He knows this.  That's why he sold out to Iran.
Um, it worked *incredibly* well.  Tyrant/bully is now a tombstone, and his subjects no longer have to worry about being fed feet-first into a paper shredder by his sons for their amusement.  Is it perfect?  No (mostly b/c we've abandoned them), but find me a non-Baathist Iraqi that wishes for the golden age of rule under Saddam.
Find me an Iraqi that is really enjoying their civil war.. 
Gee.  Just like Libya.

Well, except for the 5000 American lives lost in Iraq, the $6 Trillion spent - we could have had colonized the Moon and Mars and had $5.5 Trillion left over, the post-invasion ethnic cleansing and a post occupation civil war.

**edit:**  Trillion, not Billion
That was Bush II / Cheney.
In what universe did Bush/Cheney sell out to Iran?  They were more isolated and ostracized than ever, until our newest 'accord' that basically conceded the bomb to Iran, unless Israel acts unilaterally (which is what it was designed to do so Obama can denounce Israel and endanger our 60+ partnership).
Obama's policy on Iran - and Iran getting the bomb - has **mirrored** Bush's.

C'mon.  All through Bush's Presidency and before, there were headlines about how Iran would have the bomb Real Soon Now.  There were news stories every few weeks with expert opinions on why the invasion of Iran would happen Real Soon Now.  But it never happened, nor has anything changed with the current President.

As for selling out to Iran, back in 2007 there was a lot of tongue-in-cheek speculation that Bush II or Dick Cheney was an Iranian mole.   It was the only theory that fit the evidence;  Iran was the major winner in the Bush Presidency's invasion of Iraq and its later handling of the invasion and occupation.

As War Nerd [put it](http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=8565&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35&amp;phrase_id=57471]Who Won Iraq?):

&gt;...In fact, Iran wins so big in this war that I've already said that Dick Cheney's DNA should be checked out by a reputable lab, because he has to be a Persian mole. My theory is that they took a fiery young Revolutionary Guard from the slums of Tehran, dipped him in a vat of lye to get that pale, pasty Anglo skin, zapped his scalp for that authentic bald CEO look, squirted a quart of cholesterol into his arteries so he'd develop classic American cardiac disease, and parachuted him into the outskirts of some Wyoming town...

&gt; [...]

&gt;...got us to do the Ayatollahs' dirty work for them by taking out Iraq, their only rival for regional power. Iraq is destroyed, and Tehran hasn't lost a single soldier in the process. Our invasion put their natural allies, the Shia, in power; gave their natural enemies, the Iraqi Sunni, a blood-draining feud that will never end; and provided them with a risk-free laboratory to spy on American forces in action. If they feel like trying out a new weapon or tactic to deal with U.S. armor, all they have to do is feed the supplies or diagrams to one of their puppet Shia groups, or even one of the Sunni suicide-commando clans.

&gt; [...]

&gt; All these claims that Iran is helping the insurgents really make my head spin. Of course they're helping. They'd be insane if they weren't...

&gt; [...]

&gt; ...Turkey, America's one real ally in the Middle East, is a huge loser in this war. We slapped them in the face, gave the Kurds a base to destabilize southeastern Turkey, and helped elect the first Islamist president in what used to be a proudly secular country...

Then there's the New York Times: [Iran's Operative in the White House](http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E15FF3C540C738EDDAA0894DF404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fCheney%2c%20Dick]Iran's Operative in the White House)

&gt; "...Consider that the Bush administration's first major military intervention was to overthrow Afghanistan's Taliban regime, Iran's bitter foe to the east. Then the administration toppled Iran's even worse enemy to the west, the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq. ..."

&gt; "...Moreover, consider how our invasion of Iraq went down. The U.S. dismantled Iraq's army, broke the Baath Party and helped install a pro-Iranian government in Baghdad. If Iran's ayatollahs had written the script, they couldn't have done better..."

&gt; "...For six years, the White House vigorously backed Israeli hard-liners and refused to engage seriously in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, thus nurturing anti-Americanism and religious fundamentalism..."

&gt; "...systematically antagonized our former allies in Europe and Asia, undermining chances of a united front to block Iranian development of nuclear weapons. Mr. Cheney may nominally push for sanctions against Iran, but by alienating our allies he makes strong sanctions harder to achieve..."

&gt; "...And by condoning torture and extralegal detentions in Guantánamo, the White House antagonized Muslims around the world and made us look like hypocrites when we criticize Arab or Iranian human rights abuses..."

&gt; "...Iran's hard-liners are hugely unpopular and the regime is wobbly, but Bush administration policies have inflamed Iranian nationalism and given cover to the hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad..."

Four years later, with more hindsight, that speculation hadn't gone away:

Embassy News: [Was George Bush a Sleeper?](http://embassymag.ca/dailyupdate/view/was_george_bush_a_sleeper_09-02-2011) by military historian Gwynne Dyer

&gt; 'Bush’s actions as president did much more for Iran’s interests in the Middle East than for those of the United States.'

&gt; Yet the invasion went ahead anyway, Saddam Hussein was killed, and the United States devoted immense efforts to creating a new government. Almost 5,000 American soldiers died in support of that enterprise (together with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis). Around half a trillion dollars were spent on it. All that to build a government, led by Nouri al-Maliki, that is a close ally of Iran, and Syria’s only supporter in the Arab world.

BTW, the current estimate for the cost of the Iraq occupation is up around [$6 Trillion](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-iraq-war-anniversary-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314).

Sure
I see Bush and Cruz as the top choices of the respective elements in the Republican Party.
At this point I'd have to agree with you regarding Jeb. Rubio is coming on strong, though, and while he did come in with the Tea Party he's now more on the McCain side of things. 2016 should be very interesting. 
I'm looking forward to 2016, even though I don't get involved much in politics.
It's the first cycle in a long while where there isn't a clear-cut establishment frontrunner. I like the shakeup with the primaries that pretty much guarantees no states that shouldn't be early will go early. I also like that it's four smallish states from very different parts of the country. This should help the party pick someone who best suits America. 
With no incumbent president running, it's wide open in both parties 
I wouldn't say that. Hillary Clinton is the clear favorite for the Democrat nomination if she decides to run. 
Can you even imagine the mania a Bush-Clinton race would cause on Reddit? 
Greeny would probably have a stroke. 
Libertarians would be cutting their throats and screaming Ron Paul 2016.
Ron Paul 2020! Rand Paul 2024, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52! 
How many more times and in how many more different ways does Jeb Bush have to say he's not interested before Republicans get it?
How many times have I heard that before from a politician? His Mom is coming around to supporting his run.
&gt;How many times have I heard that before from a politician?

I give up. How many? Personally, I've never heard a politician be as adamant as Jeb has been about not wanting the nomination and then reverse himself. 

&gt;His mom

That's not exactly a groundswell of objective support. 

Besides, Jeb has been labeled as a RINO by the GOP base. He's already a non-starter. 


The tolerance of the left. In other news, Michael Bloomberg was announced as commencement speaker at Harvard and I haven't heard of any complaints. 
Wow. Who knew that all those professors were raging racists?
Or they think that she was intimately involved in starting a war with a country that didn't attack the US and had no weapons of mass destruction. A war that has/will cost trillions of dollars and cost hundreds of thousands of innocent soldiers' and people's lives. In addition, she was  involved in sending detainees to for extra-judicial punishment and interrogation at black sites around the world.

It is either all that, or you know, they disagree on tax and regulatory policy. One of those two.
I've learned two things from liberals:

The first is that any time someone opposes a person who isn't a straight white male, it's because of discrimination.

The second is that they hate being held to same the ridiculous standard to which they hold others.

EDIT: Incidentally, the Wikileaks documents revealed that [Iraq DID have weapons of mass destruction](http://nypost.com/2010/10/25/us-did-find-iraq-wmd/), and that the Democrat-led Congress simply refused to classify them as such.
Quick to throw the race card aren't you, Rev. Sharpton?
Well it is a good thing that you already know the reason for everyone else's actions and easily dismiss any potentially legitimate criticism.

&gt;The second is that they hate being held to same the ridiculous standard to which they hold others.

America hasn't been in that many foreign wars in our history.  At least one of the ones that Rice help start was sold to the public on reasons that turned out to be false.  Even without getting into a fight over whether she lied or was just incorrect, holding her accountable, in the sense of her legacy, reputation and social costs, is not *liberal* or *conservative*, it is what a just society should do.  My college invited a democratic congressmen to speak at commencement.  There was the same faculty and student protest because he had voted for the Iraq War authorization.  It at least could be that she showed very poor judgement on a very important decision and not because she is on the other team.

BTW, you are doing exactly what you are accusing them of doing, attacking a group for being from the other team.
&gt; BTW, you are doing exactly what you are accusing them of doing, attacking a group for being from the other team.

Congratulations! You finally got the point.
And my point is that you are incorrect in your accusations, they have a legitimate reason to oppose her outside of her race or political party.

It nice to know that conservatives are no different than liberals.

I realize that sarcasm and hyperbole don't translate well over the internet, in text, but now that I've explained it to you, it's time to let it go.
ELI5 why the word tolerant (used sarcastically here) is being used. 

Someone who advocated and helped facilitate torture isn't welcome. So if I object to someone based on their past policies and the things they've stood for somehow **I'M** intolerant? How does that work exactly. Am I supposed to be tolerant of people who advocate torture? Thats a bad thing (my "intolerance" of torture and torture apologists)?
It's sarcastic. Because liberals claim to be exceptionally tolerant, and yet are, as demonstrated here and elsewhere, very much not. I would have put quotation marks around the word if I were writing the title, but that's just me.
"Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views." -William F. Buckley
Always.  Always.
Could it perhaps have something to do with what Rice has done rather than what Rice says?
This author is a bisexual man who was raised by a lesbian.  His articles about the homosexual lifestyle has gotten him blacklisted by GLADD.  His opinions are well worth the reading.
This is one woman who is extraordinarily happy to have been set free from the lie of feminism.  These kinds of stories, this kind of extraordinarily stupidity isof why I am so glad I am no long a feminist.

&gt; Planned Parenthood does not seem eager to oppose surrogacy as exploitation of women, largely because it is career-oriented “liberated” women who often need to turn to surrogacy contracts, having aborted too many times in their twenties and then postponed childbearing to focus on their professional ascendancy.  

Just makes the claim. And implies that "aborted too many times" is a common factor and somehow leads to infertility. So basically this guy makes stuff up to support his position.

&gt;My allies are also right not to make this a gay issue, insofar as heterosexuals like Sarah Jessica Parker, Nicole Kidman, Jimmy Fallon, Tagg Romney, and Melissa Harris-Perry have been among the most visible practitioners of surrogacy contracts.

Is this list supposed to mean something to me?

&gt;And regardless of whether the mother consents to losing her child, the child cannot consent.

Same argument for all adoption.

&gt;Homosexuals were deemed an oppressed people despite the flimsiest of historical grievances (even the legendary gay Holocaust involved no more than 15,000 victims, out of the twelve million people placed in Nazi concentration camps).

And so we compare genocides. And then ignore the beatings and killings gay men used to get if they dared admit in public. I sure hope this guy gets the ability to return to the closet or the freedom to be beaten for his sexual desires.

&gt;By casting gay men as powerless, the left sealed their doom.

What powerless?

&gt;Gay men are men – to wit, men who define themselves as men-loving men who refuse to be involved with women. 

Who don't want to have sex with.

Anyway, never did see how the title was supported.

This article seems like a lot of bullshit to me. Can't take anyone seriously who sees Obama as more of an autocrat than Putin.
this is a non article

A) at this point it is nothing more than an accusation

B) even if it's true who cares?
Most of these subs are closed out so no one can show the errors in the article. 

&gt;This is the group of political appointees designed to allow the federal government to use a combination of medical and social criteria to determine the healthcare an individual receives.

No, it does not say a thing about the individual. They are supposed to look at treatments to see if they are effect. You know what? Every single health insurance company does that today. They had treatment limits, they had yearly limits, and they had treatments they would not cover. 

Seriously, if the ACA were that bad you would not need lies to attack it. That you insist on lying shows you are afraid that it will work. 

&gt;Peruse the publications and reports of the thinking of the architects of ObamaCare. Their various scoring systems, their social priorities would have put my wife at the bottom of the list for treatment. Obamacare architects perceive healthcare, as they do income, as a zero-sum game -- every dollar spent on her treatment is a dollar taken away from someone else.

While private insurance companies treat health care as a zero-sum game: every dollar spent on treatment was a dollar not available for executives and shareholders. 

&gt;But centralized control needs to declare medical resources finite, which in turn demands rationing, and rationing needs, of course, a government board to decide who gets treatment and when, who gets to live… and die. My wife, under a fully implemented ObamaCare, would have been among the last in line for treatment. She was a retiree (too old!) with a terminal disease (too expensive with a limited future!), a woman who had chosen to spend most of her adult life raising children (that’s not really societally valued employment, the architects might sniff) and who lived simply and lovingly, taking pride in her family and her role as a homemaker (what --no greater ambitions?)

That is simply made up, no basis in anything at all.

*sigh* Thanks a lot, Professor. Making the rest of RIT look like a bunch of douches. :/
He's not talking about climate change deniers on the whole. He's talking about the people behind the campaign to deliberately misinform people about climate change. From the article: “cases in which science communication is intentionally undermined for political and financial gain.”

Very misleading headline.
i.e. Rush Limbaugh
the article says that liberals believe voter ID requirements repress the vote. Hooray! Voter ID requirements do keep voters that should not vote from voting. Voter ID requirements prevent the dead from voting. They prevent illegal aliens from voting. They prevent people from voting again and again and again. That is the real reason liberals do not like the voter ID. 

people who do not have a valid drivers license should not be allowed to vote.
sounds like this ruling is about providing proof of citizenship to register to vote, doesn't say much about having to provide voter ID at the polling place.

I don't really get the hub bub over this. If I go to the DMV, I need proof of identity. Why not the same for voting? Its not a secret when elections are, people have plenty of time to get that stuff together. 
I wouldn't let this bother me if I were president. After all this is just a terrorist country that will soon have its own necular material to make all the bombs it wants. I am sure there's nothing sinister in this nation building mockups of our aircraft carriers. I am certain they wouldn't bomb any of our aircraft carriers. We have the important things covered in this country. This isn't important. We as a nation can relax because Mr President North End of a Southbound Mule has his basketball bracket all filled in. that nasty little guy is right on top of the important issues of having nation. Now if he would just stop skipping national security meetings to play golf.
The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche described the “inversion of values” -- how deeply envious people can twist good into evil. Obama has now accomplished a perfect inversion of American values. Putin’s thuggery in the Crimea is rewarded by a slap on the wrist so effete that a Russian politician immediately tweeted “Comrade Obama” to laugh at him. Iran was just rewarded for thirty years of murderous aggression --  thirty years of Death to America! Death to Israel! -- by a total surrender “led from behind” by Our Hero and the Eurosocialist welfare states. Even the abject lickspittles of the Washington Post dared to remind the president that a fantasy foreign policy cannot work -- after spending six years celebrating Obama’s fantasies.

Well, two of the biggest bullies in the world just took Obama at his word, Russia and Iran. Bow down to thugs and you will get what you ask for.

To top it all, both Obama and John Kerry just went into a public rage when Israel’s defense minister dared to tell the truth about Obama’s surrender to Iran -- which happens to threaten Israel with nuclear genocide. Our Heroes personally protested to Benjamin Netanyahu for the defense minister’s truth telling. As if Israel is not allowed to defend itself against a clear and present danger to its very existence.
This is called 'Irish Democracy'.

"If you always do what you've always done; you'll always get what you've always got."

A third Bush? The next presidential election is the GOPs to lose. And if we nominate Jeb Bush, we almost definitely will.
GWB won 2 terms.
He lost the popular vote in the first, and only won the second with a narrow margin primarily on post-9/11 patriotism and fear.

We don't need another Bush. We need another Reagan.
Who is this other Reagan?
Obviously, there is not a literal Reagan.
Who would you support? I can't support a Tea Party type. I like Christie.
My dream candidate is Condoleezza Rice. I also like Mitch Daniels and Nikki Haley. Christie is a bit too centrist for my taste.
I'd support Rice from that group.
I agree with Giveryourbesteffort. Out of that group I'd support Rice. Mitch Daniels seems OK. I would rather not see Nikki Haley nominated. Out of the tea party people I would have to pick Cruz. I couldn't vote for most of them, but I would vote for Cruz. Rubio and Jeb Bush also would have my support. 

Rubio/Rice 2016? 
Cruz I would definitely like to see up there. Rubio, maybe. I would definitely go for a Rice/Rubio ticket. The other way? I feel like you're putting the talent on the bottom.
Rubio's got the *political* talent that Rice doesn't have. He's a rare talent in that regard. Rice has the experience. I just don't see Rice doing anything to get back into a white house job unless she gets asked to be VP or a cabinet secretary.
I totally agree, give Rand a chance ... then let another Bush step up after two terms ...
Ouch, why couldn't you support Rand Paul? Christie is begging for defeat ... just like Romney and McCain ... they are way too moderate. We need stark contrast otherwise they vote for charisma and we always lose that because of the media ...
Paul isn't qualified to be president. He's not smart enough to run this country.
Romney's more moderate than Obama is, but that doesn't mean he's a moderate. Romney's a good conservative, one who is happy to work with those he disagrees with to meet common goals. He's really a fantastic talent and it's a shame that he didn't win. 

Cruz is just about Romney's equal intellectually and he's far better than Rand Paul. The right wing would be wise to fall in line behind Cruz and let Rand just do his thing in the Senate. If they don't they're pretty much guaranteeing someone more along the lines of Rubio or Jeb Bush would win the nomination. 
I agree with Rubio on immigration and that's alienated him from the hard line conservatives (that's a fucking shame). I'm as flag waving tea party as you get but I'm married to a Mexican/Chinese woman and both my kids are mixed. Through her I've met a lot of people who came here illegally but took the path to citizenship over the years and have made amazing successes of themselves. We need to seriously rethink immigration. My wife thought Rand was an idiot because of his accent (she judges people a lot). But once she learned his true stance and listened to him defend his positions she was sold. Cruz isn't ready yet, and certainly not in time for 2016 he's an ace in the hole. Part of this strong generation we are cultivating to run for president in the future. Look at the dem's field ... they've got a ton of 'qualified' people while we've got a bunch of 'rising stars'. We need to cultivate what we've got and after 8 years of Obama Americans will be salivating at the mouth for Rand. He's the only one who can get the youth vote as well as peel away libs pissed off at the NSA and drone strikes. He's the complete package, we've just yet to realize it as a party.
Rand Paul is the son of a white supremacist politician with some really crazy policy positions in his own right. Not just that but he reached out to the much of the same kook base that his dad always leaned on when he was running for Senate in 2010. Opposition to civil rights legislation will not help him distance himself from his white supremacist father. He'll alienate several of the Republicans' core constituencies in the primaries and again in the general election. 

Ted Cruz has the relevant education and career experience and has proven to be a real intellectual. He's of course not everyone's cup of tea but most anyone who is OK with Paul should be fine with Cruz. Cruz's positions are more mainstream particularly with regards to foreign policy.  

**tl;dr** Rand Paul's a complete disaster 
I hate to say it but any association with white supremacy the dems make against Rand will not get them any votes. Black people don't vote for republicans and unless it's their sole argument against Rand it most likely won't get out any more black voters against him. People always talk about Rand's crazy politics but never cite any specific examples. Can you? I want to know what makes him crazy (my liberal friends always say the same thing but can never really cite anything specific). I love Cruz, don't get me wrong but I think he's a long shot for popular acceptance in the party. A lot of people think of him as toxic right now due to the government 'shut down'. Don't get me wrong, he's a rising star and his actions during the shut down will be (as they already are starting to be) appreciated more and more as time goes on, you just have to think about whom he is running against. We literally just have to stop Hillary this one time to have an 8 year conservative dynasty. I'm not willing to bet Cruz has enough appeal to do that. Another 8 years with a democrat will absolutely destroy this country as we know it ... at least with Rand he'd take us so far in the opposite direction that it'd take a good long while to undo all of that and I honestly believe it'd lead to a resurgence of conservatism in America.

White people will be turned off by it too. 

&gt;People always talk about Rand's crazy politics but never cite any specific examples. Can you? 

I mentioned one in the previous comment: opposition to civil rights legislation. He's sympathetic towards Edward Snowden. He picks up a lot of his dad's positions. Take a look at [this](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/rand-pauls-plan-to-save-ukraine-completely-nuts.html) article for some recent stuff. In that article he took some stuff that I found to be sensible and just went and did what Pauls do, which is to come out with crazy nonsense. Things like saying he wants us to get back into the game of constructing missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic *but* making the Europeans pay for it, or bringing back the gold standard in the US. 

Cruz *is* a liability after the shut down. He's smart enough that he might manage to win despite that. The shut down helped to make him a hero to the tea party, which I'm sure was his goal. Cruz really is a very sharp guy. He got great grades in top universities pursuing degrees relevant to lawmaking, and he spent his career working up through the courts both clerking for the Supreme Court and later on arguing in front of it.  Rand, on the other hand, didn't have a relevant education or career experience until he became a Senator. He learned from his dad, and adjusted slightly to avoid making some of the same mistakes. Make no mistake, he's just a more sophisticated version of Ron. He still makes boneheaded mistakes like allowing plagiarism to take place in his office, or hiring huge racists and then being forced to fire them. Both are weak on experience (Cruz lacks executive experience but is strong on everything else) but Rand is just plain weak overall. 
Did you actually read that piece? It's a hit piece on Rand. It really does nothing. It's an opinion piece. Maybe I'm an idiot, explain to me why that makes him crazy?
&gt;Did you actually read that piece?

Of course I read it. 

&gt; It's a hit piece on Rand.

Of course... 

&gt;It's an opinion piece
 
And I took issue with the *facts* presented in it. 

The gold standard stuff goes back to his dad's newsletters and all that. They really want to bring it back because they are fearful of the central bankers. They really think that there's a vast global conspiracy to bring about a one world government. It's the same crap his dad pushed. 

The gold standard would, by the way, bring back the days when there was no regulatory authority to make sure that we see nice, managed inflation with the dollar. This inflation encourages investment. It's good for economic and technological progress. Ron and Rand Paul's fiscal policy would encourage the hoarding of wealth and their belief in this policy is rooted in paranoia and not sound economics. 

The stuff about telling Poland and the Czech Republic that we will put *our* missile defense in their back yard and THEY will pay for it is just absurd. 

At least you don't have a retort on the plagiarism, the racist staffers, and the poor qualifications Rand has when compared to Cruz. I'm telling you, as much as Cruz is a liability and turns off some voters Rand is much much worse. He's toxic to various groups within the conservative base such as foreign policy hawks and social conservatives, groups that the Republican party can not win without.

This is something I have always believed. No matter what a President says or promises, in the end he has to do what's best for the country.
[deleted]
My problem with that is Senator Paul is newly elected and has none of the experience that being the leader of the free world requires.  We have had two incompetent presidents in a row and we need someone who can restore the office of the President of the United States to the dignity that it once commended.
Rand is an idealist, i think this nation would be best served with him in the Senate overseeing nominations and holding the floor until the truth is laid bare.
I am concerned that when he meets evil, and im not talking about the follies of the left, he shall not know when or how to chastise those men with Honor.
Jeb may very well be tainted by the legacy of his family, but that family also represents some of the Republican tradition that is needed to stabilize the new Republican party, especially if it has to weather the storm Rand has planned in the future.

In what ways do your political beliefs affect your personality and identity?

You are invited to be in a 5-10 minute survey examining political beliefs, personality and identity.
In the past data on this project, we were able to collect responses from 62 participants who identified themselves as liberal, but from only 14 participants who identified themselves as politically conservative.

Therefore, we would be very interested in hearing about views and opinions from participants who identify themselves as politically conservative so that we gain a more comprehensive understanding of these issues.

The survey is a part of student project in our ethics class. Thank you in advance for participating and sharing your opinions with us!

I've wondered this same thing.


My current theory is that there are multiple factions inside the republic party.  The christian right, who are all about enforcing their brand of family values on the nation; and don't really care about anything else.  Another faction are the actual conservatives, who don't really care about family values.  The politicians need to appeal to both factions and thus incorporate these conflicting views into one platform.


It is possible to function while holding two conflicting ideas in your head at the same time.  
Abortion: while few Republicans package it in these words, it comes down to the nonaggression principle popular among libertarians. If you're not familiar, that principle basically states that the government should allow people to go about their own business (even if harmful to themselves) and only exist to protect a person from someone else's harm. While you may disagree, many Republicans hold steadfast that the embryo/fetus is a human, and that abortion is therefore murder of a human. Many Republicans don't view it as a big government blocking a choice by a woman, but rather a government having to act in a very limited circumstance to prevent someone from killing the baby inside her.

Gay Marriage: again, messaging is bad by Republicans on this one, but I think many Republicans would prefer 1) the government not being involved in marriage, period, and returning it to be an entirely state function, 2) if the government is to stay involved, equalize the tax code so it doesn't benefit you whether you're in a straight or gay marriage (or to go even further, to equalize it to the point there is also no discrimination between the married and unmarried), 3) if neither of these works, leave it to the states, rather than the federal government, to make the decision

So in both instances, while I'm sure there are a huge number of conservative Christians unabashedly just trying to legislate their religious views through a big government, I think with abortion, many Republicans see it as one of very few instances where big government should exist, and with gay marriage, many Republicans are not outright-against civil marriages being offered equally, but think their are better paths for equality than the government stepping in and forcing it upon everyone.
Well aren't you cute.
[deleted]
Still cute!  And it's Mr. Dr. to you.
Limited government intervention means the 10th Amendment. The states are supposed to be the laboratories for the federal government to use for guidance.

The things you noted are all on the state level and they don't necessary reflect the GOP on a national basis. They are also things that are allowed (for now) at the state level. Not a single member of the GOP at the national level are proposing or submitting legislation concerning those things.

So overall the idea of smaller government is on a national level. While you may think it seems hypocritical, in actuality it isn't when using the 10th Amendment as a basis.

Quotes from the article:

"As a gay American I am repeatedly warned throughout the media that my status as a citizen and my constitutionally held rights are at the very mercy of an angry, bigoted and unreasonable mob of Christian authoritarians controlling the country. "
"To be sure, gays experience absolutely no limitation of their natural rights and this includes the right to bear arms, to vote, or the right to free speech, assembly or religion.  Gays are not restricted in legal protections, property ownership, reproduction, education, business creation, taxation, political activism, or any other activity, civil or otherwise, enjoyed by all Americans.  Actually, gays are not intentionally excluded under any law in the land."

"The reality is that Christians, as a general group, are uninterested in discrimination and conservatives are typically focused on curtailing liberal overreach.  Christians are not protesting gay weddings just as Christian bakers did not kick out gay clients preceding the controversy in Arizona.  The issue is on liberal enforcement of their values as an absolute that we, as Conservatives and Libertarians, fight.  We oppose business owners being coerced into participating or associating with events they deeply oppose religiously. I, as a gay Jewish person, have nothing to fear in regards to my rights from Christian interference.  The work of Christians and Conservatives alike is to ensure the natural rights of all citizens are preserved. There simply is no evidence to the contrary."

not surprised there's no comments, reddit hivemind cannot deal with reality....
Didn't take long to find examples of everything that guy said wasn't happening..

That article is full of crap..

I wonder what the republican party's alternative to Mitt Romney's health care program will look like, particularly given that health insurers are pretty excited about 10 million new subscribers. 
I personally don't care, but having the convention in "sin city" does have the potential to alienate a huge chunk of the GOP base. 
Do these people find it easier to complain about possibly having a convention in Las Vegas than to actually act religiously in Las Vegas?

It seems that religious conservatives should be more secure in their religiousity and interact more with the non-religious than sticking to themselves and 'preaching to the converted'.
That's a good point but I wouldn't count on all of them to buy into it. Some could very well just sit at home rather than vote at all. 
&gt; Some could very well just sit at home rather than vote at all. 

That's a foolish argument.  That will only help to elect someone that will be even more 'liberal' than they would like than if they voted for the Republican nominee, even if he or she was selected at a convention in Las Vegas.  That's the attitude 'I would rather have nothing than half-a-loaf'.
It is foolish. That's the attitude that the Paultards have when a non-Paul wins. Some of the rest of the "base", parts of the "base" that unlike the Paul fans actually are willing to vote for other Republicans, stayed home in 2012 too. 

Personally, it's not an issue to me at all. There probably aren't a lot of young Republicans who actually would care about this being in Vegas.
Economist and sociologist Max Weber said something like 'Politics is the art of compromise'.
It most certainly is. 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney would have proven to be great at it, I'm sure. Bill Clinton's a good example of getting shit done by compromising on the Democrat side. Unfortunately, Obama's form of "compromising" is often telling the other side that his initial proposal is a compromise and that he won't budge any further. 
They make a good argument about the potential for video to get out making delegates look bad because of getting drunk or other stupid things that are easy to do in Vegas. With the popularity of cell phones and social media what happens in Vegas no longer has much chance of staying in Vegas.

Other than that I don't see any reason to not have one there. Where are the religious conservatives going to go if they decide they don't like the Republican party. Sometimes you have to say no to people who are trying to hijack the party.

Harry Reid?  That old snake is behind this?  Go figure.

From the article
And now that critical analysts have noticed that Kornze is newly-installed in his job after many years working for Harry Reid, that the Bureau of Land Management wants the water rights to send to Reid’s pals in the casino industry in Vegas, and even that a possible federally-subsidized Chinese-owned solar farm deal involving Harry Reid’s son was at stake, the feds seem to have decided that the necessary bloodshed to continue their course would lead to political embarrassment.

Although all republicans are not Christians, the evangelical block of voters nation wide have conservative/republican views.  The reason they are not pro choice and do not support marriage equality is a purely religious one.  They believe that abortion and homosexuality are sins and thats all there is to it.

But how can this group of conservatives back up their preference of small government when they are bringing religion into our laws? Am I missing a piece of the puzzle that makes this make sense?
Well I am really a libertarian and I do support marriage equality and I am pro-choice. Like MrLewis said, Conservative evangelicals make up a large voting block and provide a lot of funding for the party. Also many of these evangelicals have such strong convictions on these two issues that they disregard the desire for an overall smaller government in order to get rid of a practice they view as evil, such as abortion.  
For gay marriage I agree with you. However, with abortion it has nothing to do with the size of government, but the view of what IS abortion. Abortion (in this case to the pro-life crowd, of which I agree) is murder, and murder is wrong by the rule of law without religion having to play a part. 
You're looking at gay marriage and abortion as political issues while they are looking at them through another lens.  Abortion is viewed as murder and gay marriage is viewed as an abomination against God.  They look at these issue through a MORAL spectrum, not a POLITICAL one. I know it seems like the views conflict but you have to separate moral values from political values to understand the viewpoint. 
Okay. Cool, so abortion is the murder of a human, which is illegal. I understand how that can be a moral and political issue. I have heard the argument, "if abortion is murder, then how can conservatives support the death penalty?" Is that just because the people in death row are being punished, and a zygote hasn't done anything immoral? (Or obviously, hasn't had the opportunity to?)
But how are politicians allowed to bring their
moral, religious issues into a campaign? Shouldn't we be basing our politics on (in the republican lens) limited government involvement in citizens' personal lives and use the moral/religious standpoints for our churches and individual opinions? That's what I'm not understanding: why do conservatives feel it's okay to limit the freedom of citizens based on their own opinions about what is "right"? (I know not all republicans are Christian extremists, and I know I'm generalizing. I'm just trying to understand.)

&gt; Is that just because the people in death row are being punished, and a zygote hasn't done anything immoral? (Or obviously, hasn't had the opportunity to?)


I would say yes. Also, I would like to point out that not all conservatives support the death penalty. I myself am unsure about it. 
First I'd like to say that I don't see anything absurdly wrong with voting for a candidate who happens to have views that he believes in because of religion. I know that for Catholicism and-by extension-Christianity, many beliefs have logical meaning as well as spiritual meaning, so there would be good reason to vote for somebody who shares your beliefs. Church isn't necessarily involved per se because no priests are involved or anything, its just that it all makes sense because your religion should rightfully be an important part of your life.

The conservative viewpoint on abortion has already been explained, and as for marriage equality, a gay person has the right to marry someone of the opposite gender just as much as any straight person does, so they technically do have equal rights. Because of this, conservatives (at least from my viewpoint) see no logical reason to change the way marriage already is legally.

EDIT: Fun fact, I live right outside Cleveland.
For the same reason we outlaw murder.  Yes, they/we/I believe in a limited government (note:  I have no problem with gay marriage.  I dream of a world where happily married gay couples have closets full of 'assault rifles'.  But I also oppose abortion morally (nothing religious about my objection), and favor outlawing it once it's viable outside the womb), however the fundamental job of a government is to protect the rights of its populace, and that includes the right to life.  

I don't think it's possible to remove morals from politics; what you believe is fundamentally right or wrong will ALWAYS color what you think the government should do.
&gt; Is that just because the people in death row are being punished, and a zygote hasn't done anything immoral? 

You hit the nail on the head.  To be on death row, the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt to 12 impartial citizens that someone took a life (SCOTUS rulings have forbid it for any crime that doesn't involve a homicide), usually with some type of aggravating circumstance such as while committing a rape, or killing a child, etc.  I do support the death penalty today and going forward, as well as cases from the 90's and such that include DNA evidence.  Stuff prior to that I'm hinky about and would like to see them reopened or commuted.

Contra abortion, where the only party being punished is the one party that has no culpability in the circumstances that exist.

It seems as if you're taking the words out of Karl Marx's mouth. This is exactly what a Marxist Socialist believes in, and I have to say, you are quite wrong in many ways. 

Not to mention, this country was founded on the constitution, as well as capitalism, and the main failure in our system is the people electing the Socialists into our government. 

I have never seen a country successfully run on Marxism, and none of the people have thrived or been happy how you socialists picture it. 

Big Government = Bad
Could you please expound upon why I am wrong. I'm perfectly accepting of that possibility but you haven't given me decent reasoning. I'll address the points you've made however...
  
I'm not utilizing Marxist's rhetoric, or even to a large extent theory, outside of the critiques presented in Kapital which are accepted academic critique and required reading in almost any economic higher education.  
  
To point of electing socialists, there's only been one elected socialists in modern memory and that's Seattle councilwoman Kshama Sawant. The most recent before that was David Belgum of University Heights, Iowa (mayor from 1976-1987).  
  
As for a country ran on Marxism... well, there hasn't been one yet. So, you wouldn't have seen it be successful. As for successful countries that borrow socialist ideals and have prospered, I would point you to Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Norway.
Thanks Obama, not only is my insurance now more expensive, i have a high deductible now too.  
You're welcome!
I'll build on this a little. Several countries have attempted to implement parts of Marxism within their countries, but have failed. 

What you're wrong about: Your view on Capitalism. It's partially right, but wrong at the same time. Yes, most of the time, the job creators earn revenue. But they are still creating jobs. After-all, Capitalism is all about the capital.

As far as the American Worker goes: Most of today's major Capitalists are pretty big Conservatives; they fit together. As a Conservative, I can tell you we are big patriots, and while yes, we like to up the revenue of our corporations, we also would like to provide work to our fellow Americans. Outsourced labor is by far cheaper, but sometimes, it's not worth it. Outsourced labor to other countries such as China is good for business, but sometimes, the product just isn't as good as it could be, and we provide jobs in America.

As far as elected "Socialists" go, I would say we elect liberals with Socialist ideas, if that is understandable. 

Do you really feel that everyone should be equal, regardless of how hard of a worker they are?
There's a difference between being socially conservative and seeking to legislate social conservatism. I believe the younger generation (millennial) GOPers are more of the belief that we should protect religious freedoms, but not mortgage our economic well being by alienating those who do not want others' religious beliefs written into the rule of law. 
I am a conservative libertarian. Abortion, to me, is not a political issue.  I believe that it is the destruction of a innocent human life which I believe is morally wrong just like robbery and murder.  It has nothing to do with the size of government, the two ideas are separate from each other.

Texas teacher here. If 88% of students are receiving a high school diploma, what is it worth? What did they have to do to earn that degree? Not much.
This is solid, but I'd also want to know exactly what Texas education standards are. If the standards are significantly lower than other states, then it doesn't really say anything.
The graduation rates are closer together than this map leads you to believe. Fox News recently had to apologize for this exact thing. 
In addition to the view on abortion.  A lot of republicans (including myself) are opposed not only based on certain moral values but because abortion clinics are not easily monitored for safety conditions.  Women who seek abortion services, especially those in poorer areas, are more likely to find a clinic run under conditions that could be pose a threat to their health.
They also have the worst SAT scores. What's your point, that the Texas school system has shitty educational standards and pushes kids through the system without them receiving a quality education?
Needs more self pity and victimization. I like for an article to be a bit more whiny.

So deregulation, wholeheartedly and unabashedly supported by Republicans, caused the most recent recession. I'm glad to see conservatives gaining some awareness of how toxic their policies are to the average American. Golf clap, gold clap. 
Kevin Spacey is going to murder this guy in a garage.
From the article which is written by a FORMER homosexual man:

"We now know that Matthew Shepard died in a drug deal with his gay lover that cold October night in Wyoming. We know the drug was crystal meth and we all know the terrible consequences of using that drug.  His death was cruel and unjustified, but it was not a hate crime and it certainly was not a brilliant light shining down upon the ugly realities of a hostile and violent heterosexual population threatening gay people.  Yet why do gays still hold so tightly to this narrative?"


"The liberal mindset seems to be perfectly comfortable with emotionally gratifying lies as long as they serve a purpose.  The incident emboldened the gay left to push for aggressive hate crime laws, and despite being one of a small handful of gay bashing violence in the entire decade, the story has been continuously used as justification for gay fear of violence."
I'm black and republican (conservative), bucking the trend!
but its funny we dont have a national holiday to this guy 
What the hell kind of article was that?? He mentions these minority issues, which are real issues in the minority community. But, instead of actually talking about it, he just saying "We should be having a serious conversation about [these issues], but we won't." I don't understand why people do that. What is even the point of this article? You don't write a piece saying, "I wish we would talk about this, but it's not going to happen." You have a platform to talk about it right there. How can you criticize someone for not talking about an issue, if you're not willing to talk about it, either?
Probably because he wasn't assassinated by a White Supremacist. My family has been Republican since (1) my paternal grandfather immigrated to the United States in the 1940s, and (2) through my maternal grandmother's family, who were originally abolitionists and baptist missionaries in Ohio.

Honestly, I have a far bigger problem with fellow Republicans denigrating Civil Rights; granted I don't agree 100% with every policy initiative (for instance I think that Affirmative Action does little to alleviate intergenerational poverty for blacks, and unfairly alienates poor whites), but I am far more annoyed by so-called Republicans and Conservatives whose only response to these admittedly poor policies is to attack the messenger.

It really casts a shame on the GOP.
Ok, so first I want to give a little background on myself before I ask my question, because I think it's pertinent. I'm a liberal. I only subscribe to conservative subreddits, though, for two reasons. First, I think it's more appropriate to read more about what people with whom you disagree think, because there are benefits to trying to understand the logic of someone who thinks differently where there is none in just a bunch of people agreeing with each other (at least from the perspective of someone who lurks and comments and doesn't post). Secondly, I find conservative subreddits are much more moderate than liberal ones.

So, as a liberal, my question is this: When I clicked on that link, a popup sort of thing came up asking me to sign a petition (which occurs on pretty much any politically biased news website). But the petition was specifically for "Ending ... corporate welfare." I was under the impression that it's more of a liberal perspective to want to reduce government subsidies to large corporations...? Any thoughts?
Usually to conservatives "subsidies" and "welfare" means "giving money to" and to liberals it usually means "not taking money from".

You aren't really on topic.

&gt; Comparing the congressional reactions of the Beirut attacks 30 years ago to the Benghazi attack in 2012 helps reinforce just how severely House Republicans are embarrassing the institution with their ugly schemes.

Why is a hit piece being posted here?

The attacks that happened under Reagan were bombings. Benghazi was a prolonged siege with which calls for help went out and were ignored. Republicans are blamed for cutting the State Dept. budget, but it would have to be the democratic controlled Senate that passed the legislation to be forwarded to Obama to be signed. So once again we see democrats blame republicans for something they must have supported. But when republicans want to get to the bottom of why help wasn't provided they are accused of creating a scandal out of nothing.

Benghazi is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to this administration. Any scandal is met with stonewalling and ignored subpenas. Contempt charges are ignored. Have we finally become a nation that ignores the rule of law?

Of course the republicans hands are tied when they know nothing they do will see the light of day in the Senate under Reid. So any charges brought will be summarily ignored. 
There's now been 11 open hearings in the House of Representatives, already, none of which found anything. The House is now having a "special committee" that's estimated to cost into the tens of millions of dollars. 

What is this "special committee" going to find that the 11 other hearings missed, and how long should the Democrats wait to throw a temper tantrum?  40? 50 hearings?  Should they wait until it costs taxpayers into the hundreds of millions of dollars? Billions?  What is an acceptable amount of waste to start throwing a temper tantrum?
You mean "WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?" Right?

Because you are ok with your government lying to you as long as it's your guy in charge.
&gt;Because you are ok with your government lying to you

And you're ok with wasting tens of millions of dollars on a baseless witch hunt as long as it's against the other team, right?  No, I'm not ok with anyone lying, but after 11 open hearings that turned up absolutely nothing, maybe it's time to admit that maybe they're not lying about this, and maybe your team is playing politics and putting on a show because they have nothing else, right now, to make them look good.

But you seem to be ok with this ten million dollar committee.  They've already had 11 hearings.  Do you honestly think the 12th time's the charm?  Or maybe 13th... 14th?  How many of these "committees" that find nothing are you willing to put up with before you admit that maybe there's nothing to find?  What do you think this 10 million dollars will accomplish that the other 11 hearings didn't?  (you know... other than just making the other guys look bad)
but they did turn up something. The email that was not given over the first time that specifically states that the message we want to put out is that this was a video and not an attack.

I am almost inclined to agree with you that we do not need another committee. We know the truth. We were lied to.
The Democrats are scumbags. 

What kind of person advocates the murder of babies? And the transfer of wealth from honest, hard working providers to self entitled leeches? And the lust! They know that sex sells. It's just a matter of time before this country is the new Amsterdam. They won't be happy until our sons are pushing dope and our daughters are selling their bodies. 

The American dream used to mean something.  Democrats sold it.
A single NGO FOIA request found more than a Congressional subpoena.  How do you think this is a 'waste' considering 4 Americans (including a sitting ambassador) were brutally murdered, and the administration tried to pin it all on a YouTube video I could make in my garage, with a SecState that had the gall to ask "What difference does it make?!?" as to why those Americans were killed?

Wow. I have rarely read such rabid hysteria. Comparing the cancellation of a television show to the Holocaust. A new low.
He's also greatly overestimating the people that see the world the same way he does:

&gt;If over half of this country is pro-smart marriage, pro-life, supports the enforcement of our immigration laws, advocates for limited government, supports wages being determined by a free market not a centralized economy, and opposes Islamic extremism and terrorism, then over half of this country’s working population is dispensable should their employers -- public or private -- discover these personal views and choose to act on it.


 * "half of this country is pro-smart marriage."  --- I don't know what "smart" marriage even is, but I can only assume he's talking about heterosexual marriage (I honestly have no idea what else it would be, Googling only showed some conference talking about some conference or something). 59 percent of Americans now say they support gay marriage according to a March 5 Washington Post/ABC poll. So if that's what it is, he's wrong about "more than half."

 * "supports wages being determined by a free market not a centralized economy"  ---  a Reason-Rupe poll found 72 percent of Americans favor raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10.  And that's for *raising* it.  I can't even find a poll for people who want to repeal it.  If more than 3 quarters want to raise it, I have to think the people who want to actually repeal it is almost in single digits.



 * "advocates for limited government"  -- This is just so vague it's useless. 100% of people say the government should have some limitations.  The argument is not if it's a limited government, the question is what are those limits.

 * "and opposes Islamic extremism and terrorism" -- No one is *for* terrorism.  No "pro Islamic terrorism" person will ever organize a public boycott because you opposed terrorism.

My wife is a teacher at a low-income school in Southern California, so perhaps this is anecdotal but I think it rings true.  The problem with our nation's schools is not the curriculum, bad teachers, or lack of funding.  It's the complete and utter disinterest these kids have in learning.  I mean absolutely zero-fucks are given. Their parent's don't care, their friends don't care, and their community doesn't care.  How do you fix it?

One of the things not touched upon in the article is marijuana/hemp.

Any person worth their salt know of the hundreds, if not thousands, of uses of hemp. By just allowing the use of hemp (leaving out marijuana for the moment) would open the doors to an industry not seen in almost a century. One has to question why hemp products are legal to sell, but not legal to produce in America. From paper to oils to food to clothing, hemp would open the doors a a huge market filled with innovation. Now as far as marijuana as a medical/recreational product, the right should be embracing it. Unless they have shunned research and have buried their heads in the sand they should know that it is far less harmful than alcohol and tobacco. But they can't get PAC donations from marijuana lobbies (imagine if it was found out that a republican was discovered accepting donations from pro pot lobbies). 

On top of that they would have a reason to back off the war on drugs. That alone could lead them to changing the hearts and minds (and votes) of a massive number of voters.

Well those are just a few of my thoughts on this article.

Article is pure correlative with no causative.   It would be easy to flip and list the achievements that occurred during the opposing party's term.
There are plenty of studies that show that everyone (black, white, asian, women, men, ...) has a bias toward white males.

The most recent study that I saw sent identical emails to "6,500 professors at top U.S. universities drawn from 89 disciplines and 259 institutions...seeking to discuss research opportunities prior to applying to a doctoral program." Only the names of the students were changed to signal gender/race (Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, Indian, Chinese). The study showed a clear systematic bias toward white males.

Ronald Reagan is dead. He doesn't tell jokes anymore. He told jokes in the past, my favorite being 

"A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not."

ha ha ha.
Here's one I learned from Lt. Col. Oliver North, USMC:

"Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, and thank you Mr. Sullivan. I am anxious, as I know that you are, to put this matter behind us and to facilitate the important business of protecting the national security interests of the United States. I share your desire to put this issue to rest quickly and fully, and to further that end, I want to be able to provide a full exposition of the facts as I know them on this matter. In that regard, you know that I am and have been since June of 1968 an officer of the United States Marine Corps. As such, I have taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I have tried to do so honorably. In the course of investigating this matter, members of this body, others have suggested that statutes may have been violated and an independent counsel has been requested by the Attorney General. Despite my very strong desire to provide Congress with my recollection of the facts pertaining to this matter, counsel has advised me that I should avail myself of the protections provided by that same Constitution that I have fought to support and defend. I intend to follow that advise exactly. And what's the deal with airline food?"

Hahaha! Woo. 
Sorry, changed my grammar.
If this party wants to continue and hold this upcoming generation, they are going to have to drop the gay issue. Not only does it have nothing to do with politics, but it just makes this party seem no worse than fundies who try hard as they can to cherry pick data and opinions to rationalize their insecurities. 
That really has nothing to do with this article.  

It us also incorrect.  People are being punished for stating that homosexual marriage is wrong or that homosexuals are not born homosexual.  This is veryvmuch a political issue that needs to be addressed. 




This is a social issue, that doesn't need political involvement. 

I really wish the party would just drop it, and deal with it through their own means and stop dragging politics into. The Republican Party stands for limited government, low taxes, less regulation, and a government not telling us as people what we should do (This includes where we put our consenting cocks). 

Until then the Republican Party is going to scare off every young person. On one hand Republicans want deregulation, but only when it's convenient for corporations, then they want to regulate when it's convenient for corporations by making it harder for competition. On one hand the party says, "The government needs to mind it's own business and stay out of my personal life," then on the other, "Except for gays. Gays are gross and we need to pass laws that stop them." Or, "I want a government that's small and limited, which focuses only on critical functions... so long as this small limited government is painted end-to-end with Christianity."

The whole party is a mess, and it really needs to get back to its roots. 
Exactly, why the party of the "small government" wants the government in people's bedrooms?

I am going to post a couple of articles on this topic over the coming week.  It is extremely important.  

I know it is not news, but I am STILL going to post it.  Hopefully the more people who read this the less real news about a child who is dead by drowning we will have.  That is the whole point.  


No!
Some days I am so shocked at the great evil of Obama that I have difficulty expressing it. Evil. Horrible disgusting man. Look at what this idiot said.
From the article:
"At a Democratic fundraiser in Chicago Thursday night, Mr. Obama told a small group of wealthy supporters that there are several hurdles to keeping Democrats in control of the Senate and recapturing the House. One of those problems, he said, is the apportionment of two Senate seats to each state regardless of population.
"'Obviously, the nature of the Senate means that California has the same number of Senate seats as Wyoming. That puts us at a disadvantage,' Mr. Obama said.
"Of course, Wyoming has the same Senate representation as California specifically to prevent individuals like Barack Obama, and his constituency of urban parasites, from imposing their will on the less populous states. This 'Great Compromise' of 1787 was a condition of these states' willingness to join the United States in the first place."
Two points:
This is why people should be required to pass a test on government and the Constitution before being allowed to vote. I am serious about this. People who did not know why the Senate is structured the way it is and why the House of Representatives is structured the it is should not be allowed to vote. That goes for those of you who do not know why there are three branches of Government and why we have an Electoral College too.
This is just another moment when I finally do understand how Hitler and his Nazis party were allowed to come to power. It is happening here. Think about it. This evil man says things like this and the mainstream media ignores it. This evil man says things like this and always has and there are people who not only voted for this trash once but TWICE. And STILL SUPPORT HIM.
Talk about immoral!
This article reads like fear mongering propaganda. Also It seems Obama was just stating facts in his statement 
&gt;Obviously, the nature of the Senate means that California has the same number of Senate seats as Wyoming. That puts us at a disadvantage.

I don't see what's so wrong with that statement? He never said oh lets find a way to change the Senate count or anything. I'm sure many others here would agree this is the shit that gives down to earth Republicans a bad name.

We can't isolated ourselves from a complex world.
*isolate

I never said isolate ourselves, I said stop spending our tax dollars to support foreign nations. Each nation is sovereign. If they fail or succeed it is their responsibility to take care of themselves. We should practice good diplomacy, but should not be their cushion.

Facts are facts. Every nation who has attempted to police/manage the world's problems for good or I'll has failed miserably. (England, Rome, China, etc). Nations who mind their own business are immensely successful.
So you're saying that Canadian troops should not have been sent to the U.S. to evacuate hospitals ahead of Hurricane Gustav in 2008, or to clean up after Hurricane Andrew in 1992?

What about "[Operation UNISON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unison)" - the Canadian response to hurricane Katrina?

The Canadian military sent four ships, a bunch of helicopters and over a thousand personnel. In some places Canadian rescue teams were the first to arrive after the storm.

They relocated people and delivered things like tents, cots, water containers, men's and women's toiletries, sun screen and insect repellent. 35 military divers cleared navigational hazards like sunken vessels and debris, inspected flood-damaged levees, and repaired weather buoys.

There were also plenty of non-military personnel - Red Cross folks, repair crews for the electrical services, etc.

Over 1200 American evacuees were hosted in Canada, with room and board and in some cases full tuition scholarships for university students.

Canadian power line crews are often sent to the US to restore power after hurricanes and ice storms.  Full hydro crews came from as far away as British Columbia to help out in New York after Hurricane Sandy.

Firefighting crews and aircraft are often sent down to the US.

During the Gulf oil spill a couple years back, 2400 Canadian Soldiers and the 1 Combat Engineer Regiment based in Edmonton Alberta were on a 72 Hour notice for deployment to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

You think that this is all the wrong thing to do?

We needs friends around the globe. At points in time we will need ports to use, air space to travel in, etc. It's in our best interests to give foreign aid.
So if we stop giving Israel/other nations foreign aid they will close their ports and airspace to us? No. Do they close their ports and airspace to other nations who do not give them foreign aid? They do not. 


I on the other hand, am a fan of civilization.

They can close them to whoever they want, especially in time of war. 

You won't see an isolationist like Rand Paul in the WH.
I didn't say they *couldn't* I said that they *won't*. They would have no good reason to close them just because we stopped foreign aid. It has never happened before and it doesn't happen now.

I won't? Republicans have a long history of non-interventionism. Cleveland, Taft, etc. Only recently have we decided to meddle in the worlds business. 
Not in the future you won't. The world has changed since  Cleveland/Taft. 
[deleted]
No it hasn't. We like to pretend that so we can justify our statist pseudo-republicanism and pretend we're different than the dems. 
Isolationism did't play for Ron, it won't play for Rand. Foreign aid will continue.
It didn't play for Ron or Rand because Americans buy everything Washington tells them and are all to eager to waste away our tax dollars and soldiers lives for absolutely no purpose.
I don't need Washington to tell me anything. You have  a lot to learn about the world. You are quite naive.
I've seen the world guy. I've been on multiple combat tours. I know what the cost of interventionism is. That cost is far too great for me to justify. I've lost to many friends because the government wants to meddle in other nations affairs.

I'm far from naive. I'm sure I've seen more firsthand than you have.
NO, I've been tons of places with the military. You haven't begun to see the loss of life I saw in Vietnam, etc.

Some times the cost of interventionism is much lower than the cost of isolationism.

The reason US forces are in Japan and Korea is has been to persuade them that the US is serious about its nuclear guarantees to them.  Otherwise Japan - with nuclear powers North Korea, the Soviet Union and China next door - would have had little choice but to rebuild its military.  With nuclear weapons.

Only the US presence prevents South Korea from going nuclear to protect itself against North Korea. If South Korea did go nuclear, again, Japan would have little choice but to follow.

For US national security, preventing a five-way nuclear arms race makes a few bases look like a good deal.

It was the same story in Europe.  Without the American presence - and it's ability to use nuclear weapons if necessary to stop the Soviets from invading, West Germany would have acquired its own nuclear weapons. Later it was the continued US presence in Germany that convinced Gorbachov he could allow the fall of the Berlin Wall and the uniting of the two Germanys. The US acted - and still acts - as a guarantor for the Russians against the Germans doing something silly.

Way to stick with your guns. On the other hand, minus points for being completely unreasonable and unrealistic. 
Yikes. Can you honestly not think of one time the United States has gotten involved in a foreign conflict, or influenced foreign governments? 
Israel is indeed the largest receiver of foreign aid. Any aid they receive bilaterally are funds slotted for military development. They in turn provide strength as an ally in a region dangerous to the US, and huge contracts in weapons manufacturing and R&amp;amp;D.
Honest question - in taking on the Axis powers should every nation considered 'allied' have instead just fended for themselves? 
This presumes Israel to be friendly to the United States, and I'm not convinced that's true.
So republicans are getting interested in this issue now? Where the hell was all this concern while the NSA was getting tons of funding to snoop on us, or Bush created the department of homeland security?

Also, the washington times is hack journalism, by any standard, owned by a cultist.
I think that President Obama may be a bit overconfident in the military's loyalty to him over other citizens.
Way to fuck up the link, OP.
Wow, Ted Cruz and Ben Carson. They must really want Clinton to win.
I feel like a Duck Dynasty guy living in a Miley Cyrus world. And to be perfectly honest with you, I feel like I'm getting twerked on by Washington DC.

It's really no surprise that I identify with Mr. Phil and Miss Kay and Uncle Si. We're all Southern. And like the Robertsons, I'm proud to call myself a gun-toting, sweet-tea drinking, Bible clinging American.

President Obama calls us bitter, but I prefer to be called blessed. Besides, the only reason we're clinging to our guns and our Bibles and our jugs of sweet tea is because we're afraid he's going to take them away from us.
We're a peculiar people. That's how the Bible describes us. My Uncle Jerry, from Coldwater, Mississippi, fancies himself to be an armchair theologian. He said the literal interpretation of the passage means, "I'm an odd duck."

Well, quack, quack, quack, baby.

I grew up in a much simpler time - when blackberry was a pie and dirty dancing meant somebody forgot to clean out the barn for the square dance. It was a time when father still knew best - when the girls were girls and the men were men. I grew up in a time when a rainbow was a sign of God's promise, not gay rights.

When I grew up, spam was something you ate and a hard drive was the twelve-hour trip to grandma's house without any bathroom breaks. It was a time when a virus was cleared up with a bowl of chicken soup.
A-   Great job, but a touch too on-the-nose.

I wonder:  can this sub handle criticism?
It's astonishing how much BS is in that article. I could poke about 50 holes in it but the bit at the end where he calls out FDR for taking us into a war we were unprepared for. Are you kidding me? Are you being serious or have you taken up smoking weed? Should we have just yawned and let Pearl Harbor go unpunished? Should we have ignored Hitler's aggression in Germany and the Holocaust? You, a Jew, proudly talk about Nixon's support for Israel but slam FDR? You are an embarassement.

I think what you are describing is big government with a small amount of people, just with more computers and programs. Big government isn't really about the amount of people in the government it's about the restrictions &amp; authority the government can/does do.

Obviously for some stuff it would be great, like if the DMV used technology wisely you could be in and out in 5 min and you would need less workers and save money that way.
What I'm thinking of is much bigger government.  It would be that the economy, for instance, is guided by the invisible hand of the free market *and* the invisible hand of the algorithm.  Voters would decide priorities (do we want the algorithm to maximize employment or to increase the mean wage).  I think this type of market might work better than a standard free market and this type of governance might be a better way to maximize economic success and even personal freedoms.
Besides the fact that the algorithm would be crazy and likely not possible that sounds kinda like fascism except the leader is a computer.
It's a lot like fascism (although you could put personal liberties as a high priority for the algorithm) and the tech is probably not there yet, but might emerge in the coming decades.  This also raises the question, would you rather live in a society which is more top-down controlled if that meant, in practice, a better economy and more personal freedoms?  Do we want freedom for freedom's sake or do we like freedom because it is the most effective model?
That's a good point, and easily arguable that the computer would be more fair and less susceptible to corruption than humans, but it would be tough to argue against a programmers' biases so people would be sure to complain about that.

&gt;top-down controlled if that meant, in practice, a better economy and more personal freedoms

I can't really imagine many people having a problem with that but I think it wouldn't work that way and we would have to sacrifice personal freedoms for a more top-down controlled society to be successful. The main argument with big government is them taking away freedoms and interfering with everyday life which I think is sorta a requirement if this computer would work. 

I think it would be a little tough to argue that freedom is the best model since it probably isn't, many people are stupid and go hard against poorly researched causes (e.g. anti-vaxers) but rather we should have freedoms as a basic human right. I know I and many other would agree with Emiliano Zapata when he said "I would rather die on my feet than live upon my knees". But I am also sure lot's of people would rather live in a "better" society if it meant sacrificing freedoms.

Yeah I think the main question is how feasible this would be.  If we could have the system I described than most people would be behind it.  With the crazy advance of technology it might become doable but right now it's just speculation.

I also think that personal liberties and government control might not have a directly inverse relationship.  There might be a system where we have less control over the government (so less political freedom) but still maintain personal liberties.  It's too complicated for me to determine how, but the quantum computers might be able to do it.
Republicans just love the idea of buying black people, don't they?
This is stupid, why bring race into anything at all? (referring to original post)
Which is of course why they abolish slavery...
Abraham Lincoln today would be considered a liberal Democrat. 
Um, no he would not. The Republican Party of the 1850s was strongly based around Evangelical Christianity which supported Abolitionism, Prohibition/Temperance, Prison Reform, limited government, Liberal Conservativism, and Free Trade. It may come as a shock to some people but not all Conservatives supported, at all, the institution of Slavery. Many religious Conservatives in the North, and Classical Liberals, opposed Slavery, and they made up the core of the Republican Party and still have a predominant influence in it. Classical Liberalism is mostly analogous to Libertarianism today.

John C. Fremont, the first Republican Presidential Candidate, ran on a campaign of "Free Labor, Free Land, and Free Men." It also ran as the Party of pro-Business, implementing laissez-faire policies. It has consistently been the party of Liberal Conservativism, which has been in contrast to the National Conservativism of the Conservative Democrats and the Third Way Economics/New Deal/Social Liberalism of the Democratic Party.

Lincoln was opposed to Socialism and wealth redistribution. “Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another; but let him labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built,” he said in 1864. In 1860, he said, “It is best for all to leave each man to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I don’t believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So while we do not propose any war on capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else.”

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/15/1162020/-Lincoln-Would-Be-a-Democrat-Today-Say-Doris-Kearns-Goodwin-and-Tony-Kushner


I'm sorry, did you actually read any of those articles or did you attempt a quick google search dump?

Daily Caller has an article about an Eastern Illinois University that erroneously describes Lincoln as a democrat on a plaque "because he championed democracy" (?). Actually, no, he championed Republicanism which revolves around individual responsibility, self-sufficiency, and civic duty. It's anathema to creating a system of dependence upon the state, or creating a tiered caste system, which places it firmly against Paternalism and Statism.

Daily Kos says that to be a Republican, you need to read Ayn Rand (?). Says who? My family has been Republicans since the founding of the Party, and joined as Abolitionists. They stayed because the Republican Party championed Federalism, Liberal Conservativism, and Pro-Growth policies, while the Democratic Party morphed from Protectionism to New Deal Corporatism to Third Way Economics.

Hollywood Reporter cites the original argument for Daily Kos, but neither the Screenwriter, nor the reporter, nor the website are any authorities on Political Science or American history.

This claim:
&gt;"Oh, there’s no question," Kushner asserts. "He was a progressive, centrist candidate who believed in government, taxation, created the federal income tax, created the federal bank, created the draft, believed in a strong federal government and believed in equality, believed that the government had a role to play in protecting in minorities from the majority and tyranny."

Flies right in the face of facts. The First and Second National Banks were created by the Whigs and Federalists and killed by populists and Andrew Jackson, the founder of the Democratic Party. The Federal Reserve wouldn't be recreated until the 1913 under Democrat Woodrow Wilson. It was harshly criticized during the Great Depression, largely because it was viewed as being responsible for the crisis (and this was later confirmed by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in their mangum opus, A Monetary History of the United States: 1867-1960).

As for the Income Tax, Abraham Lincoln did that in a time of war, and also implemented the policies of draft, which are allowed during times of war. It has nothing to do with the explosion of a governmental bureaucracy, or the co-option of the Commerce Clause, or the Supremacy Clause to justify enormous amounts of economic and political consolidation in Washington DC. Simply put, its impossible to compare the Political situation of the current day to that of the 1860s. But what is possible is to trace the intellectual heritage of the Party System, where you quite clearly find the antecedents of the Modern Republican Party within its founding in the 1850s. Ohio, which was a stronghold of the Union and the of the Republican Base, is still strongly supported by the Republican Party, and its the seat of Speaker of the House John Boehner.

Moreover, the articles both seem to assume that the Modern Democratic Party has 1) a monopoly on Civil Rights, denying of course that the Southern Democratic Coalition that had existed since the Civil War and strongly supported by Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, was staunchly opposed to the Civil Rights Act, while Republicans like Bill McCulloh were vital to its passage. Moreover, it fails to acknowledge the vital role that the Republican absorption of the South in the 1970s and 1980s played in ending segregation. It fails to mention Republican attempts to pass through Immigration Reforms (notably by George W. Bush), and 2) always does what is in the best interest in minorities. Quite a few Economists, from Gary Becker to Thomas Sowell, have criticized Democratic Policies with respect to racial inqualities such as Affirmative Action, Social Security, and most forms of Welfare as being woefully ineffective and counter-productive. Moreover, Republicans generally support serious welfare reform and the expansion of far more efficient welfare programs; Congressman Paul Ryan openly praised the Earned Income Tax Credit, which was originally proposed by Milton Friedman (also a Republican) as a highly effective strategy towards eliminating poverty. However, Milton Friedman, and also Paul Ryan to a lesser extent, strongly supported the complete elimination of Welfare, Social Security and Medicaid and the replacement of a Guaranteed Minimum Income based on the Negative Income Tax. Most Republicans are more moderate (though, as an econ major I think that Milton Friedman is far more correct) and instead argue in favor of transferring most government agencies into voucher programs.

So please, don't to this subreddit with caricatures and half-backed truths. Anything that you assert without any evidence (even specious evidence such as this) can and will be dismissed without needing any evidence. Its simply nonsense.
Yeah I didn't read them, I don't want to waste my time on something pointless.
I'm curious if anyone is aware that the Taliban has never attacked the US, nor were they part of Al Qaeda. In fact, the only time the Taliban attacked Americans is when the US invaded Afghanistan and attacked them. Heck in October of 2001, they actually offered to give Bush Osama bin Laden. 

And now people are freaking out about us releasing them, especially when you realize that we are pulling most all of our troops out of Afghanistan. How will they be a threat?  Do you really think that they have the resources and the desire to attack mainland America?
Iraq didn't have the resources to attack the US either.  It's called fear mongering and it's the new GOP (since  2001).  Instead of coming up with good ideas the GOP just wants to scare everyone.  Forget the fact that the Taliban was there because the U.S. put them there. 
Especially when the voters are already conservative.
1.It's a Pentagon report, not something Obama came up with.
2.It's about using the military to provide support for citizens.
3.It mentions using UNARMED drones during times of public unrest. 
4.The article mentions using the military as a defense force only in dire circumstances.
This is a non-story.  Try reading the article next time OP.
How can someone compare the killings by one man and the killings by a huge religion?  That's not apples to apples.
I agree.  The GOP is nothing but a bunch of fear mongers since 9/11.  They don't have any ideas, the just know that they hate the left.  I didn't go as far as voting for Obama, but I refused to vote for the GOP, either.

Seriously? This is what you're gonna judge them over? I'm no Democrat, but I find valid reasons to critique them (the issues) not what their damn twitter picture is. I couldn't give a damn what their twitter picture is, it doesn't have any bearing on the differences.

This kind of stuff is what makes us look like morons. Instead of valid scholarly debate over the issues, we sit in our circle and critique their twitter pictures.
This is an issue.  How hard is it to find a picture of the US flag?  I would submit that it is not very difficult, even for a democrat.  This was deliberately disrespectful.  Not sure how you figure that pointing this out makes "us" look like morons.
It wasn't deliberately disrespectful. It is American flag bunting. Completely acceptable.

This makes us look like folks who attack every little thing out opponents do instead of focusing on the issues with discernment and competence.

This picture has *no* effect on policy, lawmaking, etc. Therefore is just a "we hate democrats" post.
This is some nutty shit

The lesson of Eric Cantor: nobody really liked Eric Cantor. 


I like how being a democrat is strictly a US thing now.
So Republicans have nothing better to talk about than who has the best flag picture on Twitter?  
Imagine a Cruz/Carson ticket. Hahahaha.

The debates would be fucking amazing. Imagine the comic gold that could be mined from just putting a microphone in front of either of them. 
While there may be something to that -- part of it is that Cantor was always trying to rebrand the party into something more palatable to moderates (to try and broaden the reach of the party)...

...and that was probably the biggest reason why Republicans who were more conservative didn't like him.
I keep hearing people say Brat won because he's "more conservative" than Cantor but he's never held office and all of his conservative rhetoric has come from a Koch funded professorship. I fail to see how "even more hostile to compromise than current representation" equals "more conservative". 
&gt; I fail to see how "even more hostile to compromise than current representation" equals "more conservative". 

Isn't that almost the textbook definition of "more conservative" in this day and age?  (And I don't mean that simply as snark.)

But what I mean is that the 'brand' of "conservative" as it's often (currently) bandied about, means sticking to principles and not backing down.  Compromise (or even demonstrating any potential willingness to compromise) is in direct opposition to this principle.

Hence being "even more hostile to compromise" is "more conservative" -- by one definition.  Of course this is irrespective of whether actual positions are in any way conservative (or not), and rewards opposition for the sake of opposition.
It would be great to have a Congress that actually works together to get things done to benefit America, but if that's not in the GOP/Tea Party platform I guess we won't see that for a long time. 
Dwelling on the past is the best way to be left behind in the future.

McCarthy seems to have much of the same views and same beliefs as Cantor, mainly his pro-immigrant. Which caused Cantor to lose his job. So why replace Cantor with McCarthy who is pro-immigrant and is for amnesty? The district he is in depends heavily on illegal immigrants to work on farmland.
So the worst dirt you guys have on Hillary was that she was a good lawyer? It's gonna be a long couple years...

This is a silly article. The GOP isn't spending money against Democrats because the data it is looking at is during primary season. The season Republicans aren't running against Democrats.

I'm sure if you looked at Tea Party data you'd find similar, if not greater, disparities in spending against Republicans vs against Democrats.

Democratic groups haven't done the same because there are few, if any, significant primary battles.

If anything this article only shows that the Tea Party is an enemy of the GOP and not a friend. Why would a friend distort the truth to make the GOP look bad?
The GOP spent money to attack **Republicans** in the primaries.   

Spin it any way you want but the GOP is working against the Conservative grassroots.  The GOP is working to protect candidates who are moderate.
Non-story.

Why would they even spend any money attacking democrats when in the primary season, all of their opponents are republicans?
The article isn't talking about the GOP it's talking about Republican PACs and outside groups. And of course they are attacking Republicans in the primaries. The primary contests are Republican vs Republican so any Republican group that is supporting a candidate is going to be against the person that is running against them.

I'm not the one spinning things.
Mind boggling stupid leap from the results of that poll to his conclusion. 
I think we found the dumbest blog on the Internet.

It was Republican leadership behind the ads as well as the calls for Democrats to vote in the Republican primary.    

Go ahead and try to provide a link where MS GOP leadership condemned the actions of those PACs.   You won't find one because they would be condemning their own actions.
Are you being insincere or are you completely clueless on what is actually going on?

The Republicans that the money is being spent against are Republicans who are actively opposing Republicans. Not just opposing them with vocal disagreements but actively running against them to try and get them out of office. Of course Republicans are going to spend money to fight these people. What do you expect them to do? Just sit there and let people run against elected Republicans and never spend any money to fight them?

What do you expect? You can't support people actively opposing elected Republicans and then at the same time complain that the Republican party is fighting them. 
Trying to get votes for their candidate is the worst treachery? 

[Far worse things were done in this election](http://www.wjla.com/articles/2014/06/tea-party-leader-accused-of-dirty-tricks-in-mississippi-senate-race-commits-suicide-104574.html)

They were primarying incumbent Republicans who vote like Democrats for things like Obamacare.  They need to be sent home.  They are RINOS.

But since you seem to have a problem with Republicans who primary other Republicans then I'm sure you're also upset with the GOP leadership who tried unsuccessfully to primary non-interventionist Congressman Walter Jones.   Republican leadership is also backing primary opponents for Congressman Massie.  Republican leadership hates them because they are consistent Conservatives who call out the leadership for going along with the Democrats to pass Progressive bills.


I'm not upset about Republicans running against Republicans. I find it shameful when people support Republicans running against Republicans and then complain those Republicans spend money against their opponents. It's disingenuous at best.
I am so happy about the Supreme Court's ruling today.

The Hobby Lobby ruling has made me very happy. **Manybthink this ruling is about denying birth control to Hobby Lobby's employees. That is not the truth. Hobby Lobby does provide birth control to its employees. It does not provide abortion to its employees. It does not provide the abortion pills to its employee. Hobby Lobby has chosen not to pay for a woman to murder her unborn child because it is against their religious beliefs.** They have a right to those religious beliefs.

  Most Christians do not mind who does and does not have birth control. Most Christians use birth control.  True Christians hate abortion. We believe it is the murder of a human being.

From the article:

O’Brien, about as fair and generous an employer as one could ever hope to work for, hassaid this about the Mandate, in words that sum up what all of our clients have been thinking: “I don’t want to know what my employees do in the privacy of their bedrooms; but when I’m forced to pay for what they do there, I am brought into their bedroom.”  O’Brien’s never tried to keep his employees from doing what they want with their paychecks. He just doesn’t want the government dragooning him and his family – in violation of their beliefs - into paying for other people’s “lifestyle choices.”
no
From the article:
Imagine that a woman starts work at Hobby Lobby tomorrow morning — July 1. She joins Hobby Lobby’s health care plan. It includes access, copay-free, to the following categories of FDA-approved birth-control:

Male condoms
Female condoms
Diaphragms with spermicide
Sponges with spermicide
Cervical caps with spermicide
Spermicide alone
Birth-control pills with estrogen and progestin (“Combined Pill)
Birth-control pills with progestin alone (“The Mini Pill)
Birth control pills (extended/continuous use)
Contraceptive patches
Contraceptive rings
Progestin injections
Implantable rods
Vasectomies
Female sterilization surgeries
Female sterilization implants
(This new woman at Hobby Lobby cannot use male condoms or a vasectomy, at least not directly. However, if she chose either contraceptive method, in conjunction with her husband, she would have access to it.)

Further, not only would she have access to these medicines and devices, but Hobby Lobby would fund them. That’s right: while White House press secretary Josh Earnest claims that it “jeopardizes the health of women,” Hobby Lobby’s health plan pays for 16 different kinds of contraceptives for its female employees!

In the Left’s fantasy world, the militant Christians at Hobby Lobby police single female employees to assure that they have not engaged in sinful, pre-marital sex. As for married women, Hobby Lobby deprives them of birth control so that each can deliver a new baby every nine months, for God’s glory, just like in the Old Testament.

Liberals are living in a cartoon of their own making.

Again, Hobby Lobby’s health plan pays for birth-control pills, vaginal rings, contraceptive patches, and other items to help female employees plan their pregnancies. The Left’s arguments to the contrary are — surprise, surprise — lies.

What Hobby Lobby will not cover are four contraceptive methods that its owners fear are abortifacients:

Plan B (“The Morning After Pill”)
Ella (a similar type of “emergency contraception”)
Copper Intra-Uterine Device
IUD with progestin
No. We need new blood. Time to move to the right. 
No we need someone competent. If we win in 2016 we need someone who can get the job done.
Moving to the right and having someone competent are not mutually exclusive. Plus if Romney was competent he wouldn't have ran such a shit campaign. I witnessed first-hand how bad his campaign was in Ohio. 
I'm talking running the country, not running a campaign. I don't see anyone else with Romney's experience and expertise, especially in economics.
I agree with Mr GiveYourBestEffort. 

There is no one running on either side with Romney's qualifications. Romney's one of the best nominees, perhaps *the* best, in my lifetime. His weakness is campaigning, but his other attributes are as good as it gets. 

Obama is a poor leader but a good campaigner. 

Right now I see the top contenders for the Republican nomination being Jeb Bush from the middle, and Ted Cruz from the right wing. Both are intelligent, capable men but neither have Romney's level of qualifications. 
I'd vote for this man in a heartbeat. He would be a fantastic president.

Romney is the great grandfather of Obamacare. We need a better choice. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, John Kasich....the list goes on of guys I would rather have than a twice loser. 
Rand Paul is completely unacceptable. Walkers lack of a degree bothers me. 
That sounds pretty elitist. 
It's not elitist, it's common sense. Out of all the people you listed Cruz is by far the best choice. 
Just informing you that it comes off as elitist. We are all friends here (trolls not included of course). 
Fuck elitist. Rand Paul is the son of the racist kook Ron Paul and it's clear that the apple didn't fall far from the tree, he's just more sophisticated about these things. Walker has no degree. Credentials are important, so is experience, and so is character. Romney has all three. 
Yeah he just can't win an election in the last decade. 
And Ron Paul, Rand's dad, couldn't win a single primary. He didn't even win the POTUS primary vote in his own district! 

These guys are all more polarizing and not as experienced as Romney. Or Jeb Bush for that matter. If you are going to go with one of those guys, Ted Cruz is the best and by a long shot. 
We are not talking about Ron Paul so bringing him into the argument is pretty stawmanning. And Jeb Bush has no chance. He is on the wrong side of so many issues that the party faithful are concerned about right now it is laughable. 
If we nominate Romney we will deserve to lose.
You brought up Rand Paul. Ron is a white supremacist and a total conspiracy nut. Rand has demonstrated that he's likely very much in line with Ron's views. The Civil Rights Act stuff alone is enough to tie Rand to Ron's horrible record, and Rand's appearances on conspiracy radio will solidify it.  Under the scrutiny of a national race Rand Paul is guaranteed to crumble. I'm sure the Democrats would be delighted if he was on the Republican ticket. 

Walker has no college degree and is light on experience prior to becoming governor. He's not exactly a Reagan with regards to political skills either. Another loser candidate. 

Kasich seems OK, but nothing about him impresses me. 

Ted Cruz, however, DOES impress me. He has the education, he has an impressive career, he has superior debating skills, and he can electrify a crowd. He's lacking executive skills and he has already been defined as a divisive nut in the minds of millions of Americans so he too has a hill to climb. 

None of these guys are better than Romney as a candidate. None of them. Ted Cruz comes the closest. 
Yup, right along with voters seeing Congress as the worst Congress in modern times (comparing polling #'s is useless when you skip generations). 

Funny also to see how the polling goes for the past 12 generations and the [partisan differentials](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-best-and-worst-modern-presidents) .  IE: headline should read "Partisan differential for Obama the greatest in modern times".   Headline would be the same for Reagan during/post his term.


Too bad an outside observer is attributing views contrary to what the individual has already stated as their views.     Does anyone really think Priebus know's Obama's views better than Obama knows Obama's views?

&gt;On Obama’s use of executive power versus past presidents, Priebus said, “He takes the blue ribbon.”

Not in quantity as has been mentioned far too many times, but maybe in  some qualitative sense that we are not privy to further explanation/justification.

&gt; Manybthink this ruling is about denying birth control to Hobby Lobby's employees. That is not the truth.

Check out the court's "next day" request to reverse lower court decisions in other cases where both abortive and **contraceptive measures** can be defunded for corporations.   This was not simply a 16/20 contraceptive measures ruling, but a 0/20 contraceptive measures ruling.  

FYI  - take a look at the "1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act" as it has been on the books for 20+ years, but those I've discussed this with have had no realization that the majority of what they are fighting for is actually already in effect.

I have never had that happen to me or seen anyone actually care too much, beyond arguing a little about issues.
Honestly I think it can really depend on the demographics of your area. I live in a fairly conservative part of the country and it tends to be the Republicans who are suprised and incredulous to find a liberal in their midst.
I'm confused about how Obama thinks he's a king, or anyone can be fool enough to believe that's how he's been making policy. Here's why. Let's talk executive actions. 

Number of executive actions taken per president? 

&gt;Richard Nixon 	Total 	346 	

&gt;First Term: 247   /    Second Term: 99

&gt;Gerald R. Ford   Total 169

&gt;Jimmy Carter 	Total 	320

&gt;Ronald Reagan 	Total 381 

&gt;First term: 213   /  Second Term: 168

&gt;George Bush 	Total 	166

&gt;William J. Clinton  Total 364

&gt;First Term: 200   /   Second Term: 164

&gt;George W. Bush 	Total  291 

&gt;First term: 173   /  Second term: 118

&gt;Barack Obama 	Total 182

&gt;First term: 147   /   Second term: 35

Source: http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php

So, President Obama has had less executive orders to date than any sitting president since Grover Cleveland. Or in other words, since 1889. Meanwhile, Reagan comes in at 381, one of the highest ever of any president. 

I fail to see how this is in anyway a valid criticism of Obama. As an independent, I'll let you know that if you run anyone with that kind of argument in 2016, Republicans are going to be in for another loss. 
Probably not. 
The GOP is headed by morons if they believe that running a moderate gives them a chance at winning. Looks like they're already conceding the Presidency again, for the third consecutive time.
Wall Street is determined to put their show pony on the pedestal. These jackasses have ruined our party.
Don't confuse what you *hope* the GOP will do, or what the GOP *should* do to give them their best shot, with what the GOP will *actually do.*

I'd bet money they find another moderate, or another old guy that has run multiple times for the nomination that they want to shut up and "give 'em their chance," or both (like McCain), to run.
[deleted]
Republicans have a decent chance in 2016 so I expect we'll end up with a decent candidate. There was zero chance we'd win in 2008 and not much more than that in 2012 so first tier candidates didn't get too involved. Hopefully one will step up now.
GOP had zero chance because McCain.

Not "GOP has zero chance, send in McCain."

The horse goes BEFORE the cart.
There was zero chance a Republican could have won in 2008. We were in a recession, dealing with an economic crisis, still fighting 2 wars most Americans no longer cared about, and Bush's approval rating was at 25%. Then add the fact that Obama was running an almost flawless campaign. No way a Republican wins in 2008 I don't care who it is.
So what your saying is Mitt Romney is human
While the attacks seem to be way overboard the comparison to terrorists is pretty apt. I'm sure she didn't mean it to come off that way but I can see it being pretty scary to see her doing the same pose as terrorists. 

Even still I don't get all the hate she's getting. Wishing death on her baby is just odd and disheartening. So much hate.
Why would an attack on one woman be a war on all women? Particularly when she took the picture hoping to outrage people and be attacked?
You have some fair points and counterfactuals about what past political leaders would be today tend to be exercises in bad history. But there are some problems with your response that should be pointed out.

* The GOP was originally the party of protectionism and tariffs. Being pro-business meant supporting economic nationalism for much of US history. The laissez-faire view you associate with the GOP didn't emerge at all until the New Deal, and even then it was not the dominant view. You mention Friedman, well in his economic history, he harps on the idiocy of Smoot-Hawley at one point, which was passed largely on the Republican vote.

* Re economics, Lincoln was the president whose administration first sought to move federal revenue away from dependency on tariffs and duties. He did create the Bureau of Internal Revenue, decried as bureaucratic encroachment. And though taxes weren't expanded greatly, one of the next major party leaders (Sherman) took up the task of arguing in favor of more taxes and less duties (not successful until the 1908 election forced leaders' hands). Monetarily he did push for a national banking act during his first year, which failed due to southern opposition in the senate. Eventually the OCC was established however and he began a program that arguably contributed to the slow death of state banks.

* The temperance movement was not a major part of the Republican party's concerns until after the war (despite what Democratic campaigns tried to imply). And even then, some temperance activists broke away to form their own party. The big takeaway for many US historians is that the temperance movement was so successful because it could cut across party lines, appealing to religious conservatives in both parties as well as former Whigs who saw it as a necessary step for progress. 

* [Evangelicals](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/evangelicals-republicans-and-the-civil-war) played a role, absolutely. But it should be mentioned this was before evangelicalism was heavily associated with things like dispensationalism and inerrancy. Many Republican supporters were northern congregationalists who weren't associated with evangelical churches like the ME Church.

* In general, I feel you're projecting a lot concerns backwards. Kansas mattered, westward expansion mattered, Polk breaking promises mattered, railroad expansion mattered, the threat of "disunion" mattered, slavery mattered, protecting duties mattered. Why mention the free-homesteading promises, but not the rest of what Fremont essentially stood for? 

* You seem to think the parties have always been completely opposed (look at voteview, this couldn't be further from the truth). Plus, left-liberalism is not third-way social democracy is not socialism. Lincoln rejecting socialism doesn't mean he wouldn't have been out of place in the Democratic party, esp. when you read the rest of the New Haven speech and its emphasis on combating laws that would diminish equality of opportunity.

Some notes on your other comment:

* The "best interests" comment is paternalistic and goes against the spirit of the rest of your comments.

* Pet peeve: Sowell hasn't published anything in economics in over twenty (twenty-five?) years, whether working papers or peer-reviewed studies. Unlike the late Becker, he's exclusively a political commentator and has been for a long time. My understanding is that he isn't the last word on the economics of discrimination either. See Schelling, Heckman, Loury, etc.

* For the record, Ohio is not the Republican stronghold it was for so long. The Cook PVI is barely short of being dead even and has been so for not a short span either. It's a swing state for a reason, and there is a lot of division within the GOP there as well, in part due to Boehner's image.

* Filibuster breaking in 64 as well as the VRA vote was bipartisan and northern (also true of the 60 CRA to a lesser extent). Dirksen &amp; Humphrey played valuable roles in steering the CRA in the Senate for example. LBJ's own rocky history in trying to both preserve party unity and provide for legislation is something that can't be summed up in a small space and is better served by reading through Caro's exhaustive research. I think you're also neglecting the persistence of de facto segregation and the ideological commitments of the post-64 southern order (see *The Rise of the Southern Republicans*).
Yeah, that's pretty much my point. Modern liberalism and modern conservativism didn't exist, but the GOP is the descendent of Abraham Lincoln's party.
&gt; There was zero chance we'd win in 2008 and not much more than that in 2012..

We were told both times that Obama was a terrible candidate and if we gave $500,000,000 to political consultants and stifle those rabble rousing grassroots people then we WOULD WIN.

Those same political consultants are telling us Romney can WIN...  but it will be costly...  they hope.
Ron Paul 2016
Except terrorists pose because they're proud of murdering infidels, murdering Americans, oppressing women, suicide bombings, and marrying off 6 year old girls to 50 year old men.

Wow. It's bizarre to hear people try to compare the two.
Terrorists pose this way because they believe they are protecting their religion and their freedoms. Same reason she is. The difference is America is a superpower and we can use our military to get our way while they have to fight in very bad ways. 

I'm not defending the terrorists at all. I think they're scum. I just think she is acting very similar to them and I can understand why people who don't have the same beliefs as her would find it scary when she posts something like that.
Those terrorists protect their religion by suicide bombing discos and markets and beheading journalists. This woman is protecting her religion by sitting around at home having cupcake sale fundraisers.
  
You honestly don't see a difference?  
  
This is like a mobster and a Little Leaguer posing with a baseball bat, and you say they're doing the same thing.
A mobster and a little leaguer use their bats for different reasons. These two women do not. Both use their guns to protect their land and their books to show they are doing god's work. 
fuck who's gonna pick our tomatoes
Great use of time is to make a law against something that was just ruled  legal.

The cease fire was rejected because it required things from Hamas while not requiring any concessions from Israel.  Mainly, Hamas was going to have to give up their weapons while Israel got to keep all of theirs. 

If they want a cease-fire that Hamas will agree to, they're going to have to actually include them in the talks next time.

From the article:

Hamas could protect Palestinian lives by ceasing its current campaign to end Israeli lives. The decision is Hamas’s. As the secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, said earlier this week, "We face the risk of an all-out escalation in Israel and Gaza, with the threat of a ground offensive still palpable—and preventable only if Hamas stops rocket firing."

Regardless of your politics, how is this acceptable?
well.... according to every version of driver laws I've read about, driving is a privilege.  Therefor its a privilege that can be taken away, the person also forgoes certain basic legal procedures while driving (most states now will suspend your license if you refuse a sobriety test pending a court hearing, some will just assume your guilty and suspend you indefinite).

I am not defending the practice, but that is how it plays out in most states, or at least the ones near NY.

Government does what every government will do, push the limits to its power to control the population.  


And at some point, like issues like this, We The People need to ignore our differences and come together to say "No, that is not allowed".

The economist had a pretty good Marco Rubio article this month. Good read.
I agree with you but solely on the basis that it is very easy to take the lives of others and destruction of property, which much more likely than guns. Driving is a privilege and guns and are a right (at least as defined by the Constitution). 

I also believe that procedures should be put into place that make the requirements of driving rigorous in order to reduce the chances of an inexperienced driver on the road causing am otherwise preventable accident. 

When you look at the requirements for driving in Norway and other European nations, they have very tough standards of driving that help reduce the margin of error. 

 Now, no system is perfect. 

However, is fingerprinting necessary? I could understand this in case of accident and they can't identify bodies... But perhaps that should be the job of a medical department? This is interesting to consider. Nonetheless, even in the event of unidentifiable bodies, it's a stretch on it's own. 
&gt;heavy police presence 

&gt;Two homeland security SUVs 

Not really. There are at least 7 less than a mile from my house. All they do is check customs and eat a Cuban diner at any odd hour of the day. 
Well, this administration has to contend with a) ruined international standing brought on by two wars (other countries don't like that), b) a terrible financial crash and c) various geopolitical conflicts throughout the world. 

It's nowhere near perfect or good, but it could sure be a lot worse than it is now.

From the article:
Had thugs not brutally murdered three young men in Israel, the Israelis would not have stepped up efforts to find those responsible. Had the Israelis not done so Hamas would not have begun the rocket barrage into Israel. Had the rocket barrage not occurred and not ceased, the Israelis would not have entered Gaza, **Had the Israelis not entered Gaza they would not have found the tunnel system, or the storage there of fake IDF uniforms, sedatives, handcuffs, and ropes, nor learned of the long- planned Hamas effort to send thousands of their troops deep into lightly guarded Israeli communities on the holiest of days, Rosh Hashanah, to murder thousands and capture and hold as hostages countless more.** 

The murder of the three young men set in motion something that may have saved Israel from unthinkable disaster.


I've been depressed for 3 years
I doubt that.
well of course its going to reflect that.

youre asking people to compare 2 people.

on one hand candidate a is a person you know a lot more about (based on observing their actions for the past 8 years (good or bad))

and on the other side, someone who youve projected your "what could have been" image on to.

essentially apples and oranges.

im not pro-obama. but ive also lost faith in the way the GOP has handled americas needs.
well of course they arent going to.

israel does this to them on a regular basis.

i wouldnt trust them a second time either.
I thought Jon Huntsman would have made a great candidate that people across both parties could view favorably. 
no cross over votes needed if we select a conservative **AND** the slugs go vote
Well, as a moderate that may or may not be the case. Many people may not go for a conservative if the conservatives keep racing for the bottom. Every time I see a conservative try to out-conservatise each other, I hesitate to like them. That's why I didn't like any of the candidates last election cycle other than Huntsman. 

Huntsman has great global and economic understanding, speaks Chinese, understands diplomacy, and understands our country's needs. Unfortunately, all of the "true blue" conservatives spent and entire debate making fun of Huntsman for being intelligent and for being able to speak Chinese. At that point, I lost all respect for every Republican candidate. 
It's become a circle jerk of trying to be the most conservative and not being the candidate America needs. After all the ridicule Jon Huntsman received for speaking Chinese and being diplomatic, I lost all respect for the other Republican candidates in 2012. It was a damn shame too. 
Legal citizens would do it, but the people who own those companies would rather pay illegal aliens unfair wages to do it. Need to secure the border and crack down on shady companies.

The whole "Driving is a Privilege" is one of the larger lies the people are accustomed too.  When a society has adopted the rights to travel doctrine, then bars someone from that travel by calling it a "privilege" seems illogical. 

I can understand if there are restrictions due to criminal behavior, but nobody is riding horses or allowed to walk on freeways across this nation. Cars are the modern day transportation method. 


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_travel

From the article:

Although Hamas rejects the peace process, its charter, written in 1988, proposes an acceptable alternative solution to the conflict: **“There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad. The initiatives, proposals and International Conferences are but a waste of time, an exercise in futility.” **

Hamas’s enmity toward Israel is not because of Israel’s policies or actions.  It is because of Israel’s identity and existence.  **The charter continues, “Israel, by virtue of its being Jewish and of having a Jewish population, defies Islam and the Muslims.”**

**The charter is not vague about how it will deal with the Jews or the state of Israel.  It further states, “The prophet, prayer and peace be upon him, said: The time will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill them); until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: O Muslim! there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him!”**

It adds,** “I swear by that who holds in His Hands the Soul of Muhammad! I indeed wish to go to war for the sake of Allah! I will assault and kill, assault and kill, assault and kill (told by Bukhari and Muslim).”**

In the recent conflict in Israel and Palestine, Hamas stands as the organization committed to the destruction of its neighboring state.  Hamas launched rockets toward Israeli population centers, aiming for civilians rather than military targets.  Hamas continued to launch rockets toward Israel during a humanitarian ceasefire, and Hamas rejected the opportunity for a truce.

**Only after ten days of being bombarded by Hamas, and responding through missile defense systems and air strikes, did Israel finally respond with a ground offensive.**

How can the GOP leadership honestly think Romney can defeat Hilary Clinton in the next election..how
About Bobby Jindal who is trying to eliminate income taxes in Louisiana and basically brought the film industry there, he's the most electable candidate or Pat McCrory. Others like Justin Amash and Darrell Issa would be great VP choices.
Tell me why Gaza or Hamas is considered Terrorists while the IDF and Mossad is not? why because they have a crony government backing them or the fact they recruit American Jews...both sides are terrorists inciting terror to each other saying one side is right is just idiocracy
[deleted]
Is this the part where the right starts a witch hunt for a truth that doesn't exist just to further divide the country for their own political ends instead of doing anything useful for the country, just like Benghazi? Demand the truth about ISIS! Right?
Bush invaded a country that was controlled by a dictator, fired the military and disbanded the government which left a power vacuum filled by terrorist groups. 

And there's only one president who actually let the growing problem of terrorism result in an actual terrorist attack on US soil. The one Clinton warned him about which he promptly ignored because a democrat told him. 
That a forum calling itself "conservative" has only 50% of voters stating that existing laws should actually be enforced, is a an indictment of that forum.
Sounds short term: "includes recently arrived unaccompanied children, who are in immigration proceedings while residing in local communities"
This is why this subreddit sucks. 
Or maybe many recognise the fact that the current law is hopelessly broken and needs to be reformed?
They have us arguing about stupid things like guns  and abortions. Let other people do what ever the hell they want, and stop going to war unless they come here.
And here is a huge problem for Republicans. We know who these people are, but that's because we pay attention,,, actually look for our news. 

Most Americans have no idea who these people are and so they have to be "introduced" to America. 


Hillary, Biden, and many others are talked about daily on the news,,, their names are known without even knowing what they stand for so that automatically makes them the safe choice.

Look at this!!

From the article:

**In 2012, according to the Census Bureau, there were 103,087,000 full-time year-round workers in the United States (including 16,606,000 full-time year-round government workers). Thus, the welfare-takers outnumbered full-time year-round workers by 6,544,000.**

This is also shocking!!

From the article:

"California, the nation's most-populated state, contained an estimated 38,332,521 people in 2013, says the Census Bureau. Texas had 26,448,193 people, New York had 19,651,127, and Florida had 19,552,860. But the combined 103,984,701 people in these four massive states still fell about 5,646,299 short of the 109,631,000 people on welfare."

Read that again.  

**There are more people on welfare than the entire populations of California, Texas, New York, and Florida combined."**


Now let's make this point clear.  These are NOT people who receive any kind of veterans benefits.  

This number doesn't include those who only take some benefits to  help.  Those people raise the number to 150,026,000.  

**Now just how long do you think this can last?**


&gt; Now just how long do you think this can last?

no worries, Obama and Yellen have it handled.  all is well


I heard that Rand Paul once said the word "compromise" without sneering and spitting at a liberal one time. *coughRINOcough*

Even if the democrats are exaggerating things for their own benefit..

There does seem to be a number of republicans promoting weird ass laws which primarily affect women and their personal rights. Not to mention the seeming dislike of making it easier for people to vote.

I don't see how someone can pretend to be for small government while trying to get the government involved in an individuals medical concerns or by blocking a persons right to vote.
[deleted]
I call myself an independent because I find both sides much too extreme. Yet, there are things I agree with in both.

I think that because the north won the civil war more emphasis has been placed on federal control rather than state control. I think overall its good, but nothing is ever perfect. I would promote more of a balance between the two.

I was just giving my perspective on the issues you brought up. There seems to be more too it than just rhetoric from democrats.

It may not be a general belief of republicans but many of the ones trying to make laws seem to promote these seemingly anti Individual rights laws. Or laws that just seem to want to shame women.

If i don't like government control why would I support a government controlled ID system, when there isn't an issue with fraud?
[deleted]
&gt; What? I don't get what you"re saying here. Who is"shaming" women?

You haven't heard of 'Governor Ultrasound' and others like him? Kinda disturbing even without the political exaggeration from the sides.

&gt; Show me where there has been a push for a national ID that hasn't come from the left.

Not sure why this is relevant. I'm not trying to push national ID cards or either sides agenda. I don't really see there being much difference between a state controlled ID system or a fed controlled one. Either would be way too easy to abuse on a large scale.

&gt; Explain to me why showing an ID is deterrent to voting.

It just adds an unneeded step and makes it harder for the people who wish to participate in the system. 

Also seems to strike me as 'guilty until proven innocent'..

Not to mention the massive government controlled databases it would result in. Don't care if its state or fed controlled. It just seems like a bad idea to me.

&gt; One instance of voter fraud is one too many.

I don't see how a voter ID would make it less likely to happen.. Fake IDs seem to be pretty common as it is and voter fraud doesn't seem to be common at all. It's illegal, can't we just leave it at that?

&gt; There are too many illegals in this country who have state issued ID's who may also be registered to vote, and are voting.

I'd give anyone whos been here and worked here for 10 years the right to vote with the option of citizenship 5 years later. Within that time, felonies would get you arrested then deported after time served. etc..

Other than that I'd pretty much open it up to everyone. It's supposed to be 'The hope of a better future' and I think it's better to give people the benefit of the doubt until they prove otherwise.

&gt; You are only giving the same reasons of opposing things the left gives.

I did say I agree with parts of both sides.. This time I think they are mostly correct once you disregard the exaggerations.

&gt; Smaller government doesn't mean what you think it means.

Well then it seems to mean different things to different people. I get the impression that many people use it to mean 'wasteful government' or 'interference' rather than the state/fed argument you use.

Which is a different issue altogether and I think it needs to be balanced between the two regardless of what a piece of paper says.
[deleted]
&gt; And once again, that should be within a states rights, not federal.

Why do you keep trying to deflect this into a state vs fed debate?

Individual rights are what we are talking about here and they are being infringed upon by people like him. Neither the state or the feds have the right to try and shame women with unneeded medical procedures.

&gt; One wrong doesn't justify the whole system? 

You really don't see the difference between almost insignificant amounts of voting fraud and lots of accidently killing innocent people?

&gt; Allow someone to vote due to residency rather than citizenship is asking for anyone who has a green card be allowed to vote in the future.

Yep.. I think if this is your home you should have the right to be heard. Though not run for office unless you were born here etc.

&gt; Then you need to decide which side of the fence you are on. Some policies don't allow for a middle of the road approach.

Nope, I'm not becoming part of the problem. There are enough people to do that for me. I make up my own mind.

&gt; it does mean wasteful government and interference

Well then maybe you should be more specific when you try and talk about these different issues.

You seem to be assuming that just because its federal gov it will be wasteful and interfering. I don't see state gov being any better. Hense why I promote a balance. Both are necessary evils.

&gt; You should be ashamed of calling it merely a "Piece of paper."

I think people should be ashamed of themselves for needing a 200 year old piece of paper to tell them how to live together.

We should be able to think for ourselves and change it as we see fit, without the 'hero worship' of it.

I never claimed to be a republican..

Thanks for making it pretty obvious I'm wasting my time trying to have a rational discussion with you.

I would suggest this exact attitude is why the republican party is slowly imploding. Unless people agree with everything you do, people like you attack them and force them out of the party.

Good luck winning any national elections like that.

Games are fun.. Sorry you seem to have such a huge stick up your ass, that you cant enjoy them.

Saying that we shouldn't idolize a piece of paper isn't disrespect of the law or our history.

Seeing value in the constitution isn't whats hurting republicans and I never said it was.

It's this distortion of what people actually say, It's the laws that impinge on female rights, It's the attitude where you think I'm a Troll for honestly trying to discuss things, It's trying to undermine my credibility with personal attacks rather than making a real argument.

Is that clear enough for you?


[deleted]
You already lost the argument the moment you started looking through my comment history to try and undermine my character.

Being called a fool by people like you isn't much of an insult.

Why don't you actually try addressing the things I say rather than distorting them so I fit into your little box of biases.
There is also this new story that says the above might not be credibl.

There are other numbers out there

All total 139 million. 

Not even close to the waste we spend on corporate welfare to just one company. 
Really. 
Admittedly, I am not a republican, but I do subscribe to this subreddit to get exposure to opinions that differ from my own, but this is an issue I will never understand.

I'm a teacher at an urban, low-income, inner city school in Houston.  We just started the school year, and have a large number of newly immigrated students as well, primarily from Honduras, who, understandably, do not speak English.

I've talked to a few of them (in Spanish) about when they moved here, and why.  One of them was comfortable enough to give me the complete picture.  They moved here a month ago, because his father was murdered.  The kid is 11.  I had students last year who came here because of the exact same situation.

What, exactly, do you expect these people to do?  Stay in a country where there lives are literally at risk day in and day out?  How is it a moral position to insist that, since this kid happened to be born in a different country, that he doesn't have the right to live here like I do and not have to fear being gunned down in the street whenever he steps out of his home?

If I have a slightly higher tax burden because of that, so be it.  No person should have to live with that fear, and if they can get out, they should.

Edit: Thought I should add, I'm not trying to be combative or abrasive, but this is an issue where I really have a tough time appreciating the perspective of the political 'other side.'
I expect them to come here by legal means only and to learn the language once they are here. 
Upvote for this. 

It's not feminism though, is it? 

It is just "we want to be on the latest fad before everyone else" thing. The thing has just been co-opted by feminists. 

Like,. take that woman sarkeesian. 

We know that tactic. You wanna make some quick money? Hire some people to protest your own shit. works like a charm in the age of social media. 

The problem is, the feminist commenters are reading it like the fliues, and are catapulting it up. Same with zoe quinn. Articles about that allmost exclusively have a packaged deal of more views then you can handle incoming. 

See, the problem is, literally, if this was a dude, you would not give two fucks. Literally, you would go "So, you the bloke that wrote this game? did it sell well? You plan to write some more? You good like that? ". Bam, done. 

Now, with a woman, you automatically want to commit the mortal sin of video game journalism. Talk about non video game related stuff. On the one side, you will piss off your entire readership.
 
On the other side, it is morally right covering that article, plus, you get the covered views package. 

So yea. In total, Shut the fuck up about feminism already and finally talk about playing video games.

And to point out, no one school or district is taking on 1400 students.
Schools are paid by butts in seats, so many districts would see this as a windfall. 
it should be "pled guilty" not "pleaded guilty"
Being white in America and being black in America are different. Being a cop and being not a cop are also different. The one event is not like the other...

Do you believe that cops should be able to indiscriminately kill blacks without consequence or do you believe that if a cop wrongfully kills a man then justice should be served? 

After considering that, recognize that the justice system works differently for blacks and whites...

Here is some historical context. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot

Try to imagine being black and hearing about this from your grandparents. Now imagine a cop kills a black kid in your neighborhood and leaves his body in the street for 4 hours...

Have some sympathy.

that's fine, but he has to FIGHT.  Romney "had" Obama in two debates, then debate 3, he let Obama off the hook = lost the election

not sure Romney can do that...too nice a guy
I'll disagree.  I think there are two reasons Romney lost:  (1) the Republican primary mess left him in a situation where the Obama campaign was spending hundreds of millions of dollars on making him look like an axxhole with Romney having no funds to the do same until after he got the nomination, and (2) gaffes, including calling half of America lazy sxxts.

I'm a conservative and find it hard to believe that our party spends so much time focusing on these pety issues. We don't like athethist because they don't believe in God. They don't want to say the pledge of allegiance with under god in it. Who cares we want smaller government, we oppose Obama because of his over reach yet demand him to use the government to prevent athesiest from removing God or religion from public spaces. We can't demand the government out of our second amendment by pushing it to stop the separation of church and state. It only seems to be fair when Catholics get to hand out our religious information but if an athesiest comes and demands that we not do it at the state building, they're the wrong doers. This article just shows that our party is picking small battles and not staying focused on the real issues like the IRS, Russia or actually doing something in Iraq. 
You missed the crux of the article. His George W. Bush story that he uses at speaking engagements around the country is a lie.

If /r/conservative, /r/republican, or /r/republicans were filled with small pieces like this, I'd agree with you, but they're not. They do focus on the IRS, Russia, and Iraq. I mod a small neoconservative sub dedicated mostly to foreign policy.

Rand Paul is probably the absolute worst candidate the Republicans could nominate out of all the likely contenders. 
I know I don't believe my party will ever again present a presidential candidate. I am just being angry. 
The Republicans will present presidential candidates every 4 years. They'll even win at least a few times before you die, assuming you live another 50 years or so. 
Therr's no way. Romney had said multiple times that he does not want to run again. 
Never say never. If the field doesn't have a strong contender to run from the middle I think Romney might jump in. 
The "with special skills" is a pretty important part of the article. I'm fine with this, it's not like they're just letting randos in.
That is an odd thing. They have not defined it at all. 

I got out of the navy in 2009. I do remember all the PSAs we had that foreign service members could fill out the immigration paperwork without the fees, when that law was passed by Bush. Foreigners in the military is not new.

Dem candidates are all running away from Obama as an election tactic.  no sincerity here
"Common sense policies" is bait for people who don't have access to the internet.  She's not gonna win over the younger demographic with hand wavy shit like that.
From the article (the very first paragraph)...

&gt; The message from Republican officials has been crystal clear for two years: **The 2016 Republican primary cannot be another prolonged pummeling of the eventual nominee.** Only one person ultimately benefited from that last time — Barack Obama — and Republicans know they can’t afford to send a hobbled nominee up against Hillary Clinton.

The Democrats *also* had a long, protracted primary race too -- but no one on their side got terribly hobbled by the process.

It seems to me like the problem isn't the process, but the *candidates* themselves (on the Republican side) -- some of whom were at odds with each other about very basic things, and were intent to fight about those things in public.

But what can be done about that, when the party is so split and splintered, is really a quandary.

From the article:

"The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Monday that other U.S. hospital workers may have Ebola after a Dallas nurse tested positive for the virus, as he vowed to "double down" on training for health care workers -- raising questions about whether he told the truth when he initially assured the public and Congress that U.S. hospitals are capable of treating Ebola patients." 

"Thomas Frieden, at a press briefing on Monday, said the CDC would be taking a number of steps including offering more training and outreach throughout the health care system. He said they need to 'rethink' their approach to the virus. "

well that just reassures me. I am convinced that the CDC has it all under control.

What a crock of bullshit. Let's squander another 3 trillion dollars and further delay the inevitable large-scale war in the middle east for no reason. Fuck off with this shit.

Conservatives and republicans are very much to blame for letting AQ regroup and  respawn as ISIS (Or ISIL or IS or whatever they want to call themselves tomorroe) and Al Nursa, and whatever group wants to fight to be Alpha Wolf in the pack.

They tossed Bush and the Bush Doctrine under the bus in 07 or 08 - and acted as if there was nothing wrong with the "Non-War" doctrine of the Obama administration. Romney basically said he'd have done everything just like Obama.

he US, France and UK bombed the gaddafi regieme into the historybooks while arming untrained and unaccountable militias... and then never disarmed the militias! Without the west removing Gaddafi - Gaddafi would be passing power on to his kin today. But rather than help reconstruct (as we did in Germany after WWII, as we did in Japan after WWII) The US, France and UK abandoned Libya 1 week after a US drone took out gaddafi's getaway convoy.

How has Libya been since then?

This is a failed policy. Iraq was a success... until we decided to stop at Iraq's borders and watch the army of AQ/Alnursa/ISIS rearm, recruit, regroup in Syria for 3 years until they were ready to invade Iraq again! 

Not one republican could stand up and say the same thing they said from 01-08. Instead they all just sat and watched too.

There is another path. In some other universe the world decided to remove gaddafi in Libya and secure it rather than let it become the new afganistan... To remove Assad and secure Syria rather than let it become the new home for AQ, al Nursa and ISIS (or ISIL, or IS, or whatever they want to call themselves tomorrow...)

 In some other universe the world decided to fight to win. But not this one... which is a crying shame for the 50,000+ dead in Libya and the 200,000+ dead in Syria, the millions displaced living in desert camps and foreign countries in poverty, and god knows how many more to come before someone in this world can articulate a reason to fight and not just say we must accept either dictators or chaos.

In some other universe we didn't give up on the war on terror.

Freedom and democracy is not an American ideal nor a western ideal. It is a human ideal. One we must fight for. But unfortunately since that opinion is not popular - there is no one left to explain why it is necessary.
when you play poker and you are dealt a bad hand, you fold

trouble is, Obama dealt this hand and doesn't know what to do
Yeah it's easier to say that behind a keyboard than it is behind the stock of an M4.
Is that where you are now?
Right this second? No, but I will be if this turns into Iraq '06 again.
So when you were in Iraq in 06, were you training troops?
To clarify, I've never been deployed. I just meant that I would be if deployments were in full swing like their were in '06. I'm not going to pretend I have a solution for the ISIS Crisis (hah) but just from what I see, people are tired. Just tired of losing friends and family to solve a problem that's only getting worse.
&gt; To clarify, I've never been deployed. I just meant that I would be if deployments were in full swing like their were in '06.

Fair enough. What branch are you in? How long have you served? My service was short, not very honorable, and back when AQ was just a police action issue and not a military enemy. Have you met anyone who deployed to Iraq and helped trained Iraqis, or helped rebuild the infrastructure, or helped organize and maintain security for free elections?

I ask - because those I know who did so seem to be able to articulate that there was a reason to do so. If you ask those people "Why didn't you just bail after pulling Saddam out of the spider hole"... they tend to be able to explain why. And they tend to be able to articulate it well, and from personal experience.

I've also met many who say it was all pointless, usually because they lost friends or brothers or sisters. So it can go either way.

You seemed to be one of those latter folks, and not the former. Although I find even the latter, when asked, can at least describe why restoring order to Iraq or Afghanistan was important - although useless or a waste of life in their eyes.

&gt;from what I see, people are tired. 

I agree. People are. That is why it is so important to try to articulate an end goal. The solution to ISIS, and AQ, and al Nursa and Assad and the entire clusterfuck that we are currently bombing seems to me to be more than just dropping bombs and not crossing the boarders to attack them in their safehavens. That is why it is getting worse. Because we are playing some semantic game rather than articulating the problem and the only solution to that problem. The only solution is to remove them with force.

No life is worth it. There is no death worth celebrating. But that doesn't mean the effort is pointless.

There is nothing on the table for negotiations. There is no promise that after setting up the Levant that ISIS, or ISIL or IS whatever namechange they give themselves next week... or AQ or al Nursa, or whatever group decides to fight to be alpha dog of the pack next week... There is nothing being offered from these terrorists to make them stop. Thats why we shouldn't stop at the boarders either, or play the semantic "Non-War" game - where we pretend we aren't at war while actively deploying special forces and bombing Iraq and Syria and many other countries from the air. Because we are at war. And the war doesn't end as long as we leave safe havens for the enemy to regroup, rearm, recruit, and organize... as we watched ISIS do from 2011-2014 when they invaded Iraq.
National Guard, been in a year. I know a few who trained the Iraqi Police but i don't know them very well. I agree that the intervention was necessary and I think that we're better to fight a proactive war than a reactive war. That being said, my issue is that the current powers that be won't simply take the next 6-12 months and send a real fighting force. The issue is that we send small forces and say "minimal boots on the ground" and they just don't have the man power to fight a proactive fight sometimes. This all being said, I signed up to serve and if they deploy me I'll go with 2 hooahs and a high five.

Here is Rebuttle at the bottom of the page

Hschneider, I guess you don't include blacks as Americans.

• When Obama entered office on January 20, 2009, U.S. unemployment stood at 7.8 percent. By April 2014, that Bureau of Labor Statistics figure had fallen to 6.3 percent — a modest improvement. Among blacks overall, joblessness dropped, though less significantly — from 12.7 to 11.6 percent. But for blacks aged 16 to 19, unemployment grew from 35.3 to 36.8 percent.

• Obama’s somewhat more sanguine unemployment numbers, such as they are, seem less about job growth and more about people simply abandoning the workforce — whereupon they conveniently exit the unemployment rate. The more revealing labor-force-participation rate thus fell from 65.7 percent in January 2009 to 62.8 percent last month, a portrait of disengagement last witnessed in March 1978. For black adults, that number slipped from 63.2 to 60.9 percent. While 29.6 percent of blacks aged 16 to 19 were working when Obama took power, only 27.9 percent were employed last month.

• Poverty has increased under Obama. Overall, 14.3 percent of Americans were below the poverty line in January 2009, versus 15.0 percent in 2012, according to the latest available data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. Similarly, the share of black Americans living in poverty expanded from 25.8 to 27.2 percent.

• Inflation-adjusted median household income fell across America, from $53,285 in 2009 to $51,017 in 2012, the most recent Census Bureau data indicate. Blacks slid, too, from $34,880 to $33,321 — and at a much lower income level.

• America’s population of food-stamp recipients soared overall from 32,889,000 in 2009 to 46,022,000 in 2012, the latest Agriculture Department statistics show. For blacks, the analogous numbers are 7,393,000 when Obama arrived to 10,955,000 in 2012.

• In spite of $275 billion in housing-market bailouts that Obama unveiled in his first month in office, home ownership actually has waned. In the first quarter of 2009, 67.3 percent of Americans owned homes. By 1Q 2014, that Census Bureau figure was 64.8 percent. Meanwhile, black home ownership during this interval sagged from 46.1 to 43.3 percent.

Not exactly a vast improvement for the group that has given him the most support!

If you think the rest of Americans' conditions have been vastly improved you may be right if you mean the wealthiest Americans, but I challenge you to name "vast" improvements for the middle class and the poor.

You do understand vast means a very great extent or immense. Show me some stats the reflect immensity. More welfare isn't exactly what anyone would call improvement, unless of course that is your American dream. .
When Rev Wright preached political commentary, we tried to remove his tax exempt status. How is this any different?

Hard to tell. From the article: "To put this week’s jobs report in economic perspective I reached out to Bob Deitrick, CEO of Polaris Financial Partners"  Polaris' website is under construction.  Can anyone contact them to verify the information?
He won't really be appreciated until we elect the next president.  He has done a great job, even with the the most fierce opposition a president has ever faced in my lifetime. 
TL;DR - "Yes, all those facts are irrefutable, but if you really split hairs you can find negative numbers in certain segments of America. I'd like to both point out that there are struggling segments of the population and condemn the programs (unemployment, welfare, etc.) designed to help those people - programs which, in turn, help stimulate the economy in places there would otherwise simply be a lack of economic activity. Also (and I assure you this is COMPLETELY unrelated to my bullet points and disdain for the President), Obama is black and the Great Recession, from which the entire world is still recovering, is his fault even though it started before his term."

Given republican's slashing the CDC budget by 500 million or nearly 50% since 2006 that's reallllll rich.
Republicans gave the CDC more money than Obama asked for. Also, the Democrats held huge majorities in both houses for the first two years of the Obama presidency. If any cuts prior to 2009 were a big deal to them they had plenty of time to rectify it. Just today I saw that Obama's transition team was told by the CDC that they should set up 18 "global health centers" but only set up five. 
Budget actually went up for the CDC in 2009 and 2010,

The two years managed under democratic majorities.

http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2014/10/14/cdcbudget.jpg

So you know dems did increase funding for the CDC when they had the chance, but to claim they had a majority is a bit of rhetorical bullshit when the main topic of conversation in 2008 - 2009 was the filibuster in the senate. 

I wish republicans had let democrats do what they want, you might actually have a rhetorical stick to hit them with after 6 years of uninterrupted rule, but instead you have a lot of botched half ass attempts at reform where republicans are the crying children with their dicks in the pie.
The Democrats had such strong majorities in 2009 and 2010 that they could do whatever they wanted to do, and the Republicans in power actually gave Obama *more* money than he wanted for the CDC earlier this year. 

Go back to /r/politics if you want to mindlessly cheerlead  for the Democrats and attack the Republicans.
Oh you won't find me mindlessly cheer-leading for Democrats either, but bullshit deserves to be called bullshit regardless of what side of the aisle its on.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/US_Senate_cloture_since_1917.png/1920px-US_Senate_cloture_since_1917.png

All I was saying is that republicans basically did not let the democrats do anything they wanted to do, and so to blame the democrats for those policies is asinine on its face. 

If republicans had not abused the filibuster at an unprecedented rate, and had not blocked more administrative nominees than any other previous congress the rhetorical attack that democratic policies are broken might have some weight.

Instead you just have the kid who pissed in the lemonade blaming his mother for the off taste.
You're ignoring the facts. The facts are that the Democrats had such strong majorities in 2009 and 2010 that whatever may have happened in 2006 could have been changed, that the Obama Administration did not follow through recommendations the CDC sent to his transition team in 2008, and that the Republicans in the House actually gave the CDC more money than Obama asked for in 2014. 

Head off to /r/politics if you wish to continue with what you are saying, I'll stick to reality.
Umm as I demonstrated the budget for the CDC increased in those years.

You can't have your cake and eat it too in reality world.
I looked at your Media Matters link. 

The Democrats were in charge of Congress between 2007 and 2011 and presided over much of the drop in funding. The Democrats were in full control in 2009 and 2010, with the presidency and huge majorities in Congress, yet the CDC's funding remained well below the 2006 level. In 2014 Republicans gave more money to the CDC than Obama asked for. 
I wonder what the cost of living for these districts are... Hmm?

Flashback to [this](http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2011/04/maria_chapelle_nadal_jamilah_nasheed_threat.php) classic story of her feuding with a state senator back in 2012 at a Lil Wayne concert. 

In light of her recent arrest, this particular comment stands out:

&gt; "I'm praying for her, honestly," says Nasheed. "She's a very intelligent person who can go far in Missouri politics, but she needs to get on some medication and see a psychiatrist." 
Shame he's just now realizing what some of us realized 6-8 years ago....
We need to take  these terrorist attacks seriously.
Wow, a lot of hatred and vitriol in the comment section of that page. Has there been any official release as to the individual's intent or reason?
Hypocrisy is standard-issue for the Left.  It's who they are.  It's what they do.
I like watching her shows where she doesnt attack republicans.

I haven't seen it yet, but I bet its good.
From the article.

"Pennsylvania allows religious objectors to cut ties with unions as long as they donate an equivalent agency fee payment to charity. That money is given to the union, which is then supposed to send it to the charity of the teacher’s choosing.

Jane Ladley, an elementary school teacher for 25 years before retiring in June, said that the union prevented her from directing her $435 donation to a scholarship fund to teach high school seniors about the Constitution because it was 'too political.'"

All of this is disgusting. The idea that the teachers union can dictate what a person who does not want to belong to that Union must do with the union dues is repugnant. This is one of the reasons I hate teachers unions. Teachers unions do not care about the quality of education, they care about their money and their power. Part of the problem with our poor education system is the teachers union.

I'm also very disgusted with this entire reaction to the Constitution. Liberal run state. Stupidity gone to seed.

From the article:

"A New York Times article exposed that the Democrats are expecting to have their clocks cleaned in the election in a week or so.  Democrats believe that their only hope is to get out the black vote.  How do they plan to achieve this?  Of course, with their tried and true tactic of race-baiting.

In other words, the Democrats and their MSM operatives have launched an all-hands-on-deck deplorable effort to convince black Americans that white Americans are out to suppress and even murder them.  Democrats pray that hordes of enraged blacks will forget about how they have suffered under Obama and flock to the polls to vote for Democrats.


In my opinion as a Christian, the Democrats' hate-whitey-get-out-the-black-vote scheme is a satanic plot conceived by deviant minds."



From what I hear, these weapons can be traced back to earlier US involvement in the region.

So not at all puzzling..

This is such a lively sub. Anyhow, the media will probly choose Krispy Kreme for us. They'll push some poor sack like him to ensure another Democrat win.
I hope so dearly Jeb isn't chosen to run against Hilary. The media fallout would be cataclysmic for the party.

Reagan would have sent in an "humanitarian escort team" to free the soldier week one
Absolutely disgusting.
government roadblocks that make it difficult for families to choose from a broad, private-sector menu of health-insurance policies


THIS is why you GOPers are doomed to complete and utter failure.
You seem to think it's government standing in the way of people buying insurance when it's because THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUCKING MONEY.

Want to make sure everyone has healthcare?   Then implement policies that encourage companies to pay their workers well.   But we know that won't ever happen as the GOP has it's lips locked around the anus of the uber-wealthy and asking them to take a pay cut isn't happening....ever.
yea, I knew Cruz would hold and have been pondering if The Establishment will risk warfare with the conservatives or stick to basic Republican legislative policies for the two years
LOL Obama executing power with little restraint.

Ha, he hasn't been able to fill most of his positions because of a refusal to even vote on hiring people for some of them.

This guy clearly doesn't remember the "unitary executive" under Bush. I wish Obama was half as adept at a run around congress. 
&gt;THIS is why you GOPers are doomed to complete and utter failure. You seem to think it's government standing in the way of people buying insurance when it's because THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUCKING MONEY.

That was a reference to the inability to buy health insurance plans across state lines. Opening up the ability for competition will likely drive insurance plan prices down. Maybe the reason they don't have enough money is because the prices aren't low enough and there isn't enough competition?

&gt;Want to make sure everyone has healthcare? Then implement policies that encourage companies to pay their workers well. 

Do you actually mean *force* not *encourage*? Those are two separate ideas. 

&gt;But we know that won't ever happen as the GOP has it's lips locked around the anus of the uber-wealthy and asking them to take a pay cut isn't happening....ever.

I really hope you aren't a Democrat speaking like that. Both the Republicans and Democrats receive large amounts of support from wealthy individuals and organizations. 
The thought of ronald reagan getting sodomized by a shemale is in fact the american dream
Wisconsin did pretty much everything you mentioned in a shorter time frame however. IDs were requested but not required for the first few (non-presidential) elections.
Even if the ID is free people will claim that the supporting documents to get the free ID are not free (Wisconsin Birth Certificates cost about $20 for example) of that the time involved isn't free.

Personally the Liberals I know agree with the ID requirement. Its one thing that just makes sense as you put it.

REPUBLICANS WON THE SENATE IN THE EXACT WAY THEY HOPED-PLUS RIC'S TWO CENTS WORTH

11 hrs ago by AP

CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press [Comments by R Andrew Ohge aka Rex]

Republicans wrapped up Senate control before midnight, their wish list becoming reality:

WISH LIST

- Win seats being vacated by retiring Democrats in West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota: Check.

- Defeat vulnerable Democratic incumbents in states such as Arkansas, Colorado, North Carolina: Check.

- Protect Kansas Sen. Pat Brown from a challenge by independent Greg Orman, a man who could help Democrats keep control if the race for a Senate majority came down to a photo finish. Check.

- Fend off Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes in her head-on bid for an upset against Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the minority leader now set to become majority leader. Check.

- See former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown defeat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen across the state line in New Hampshire.

Well, you can't have everything.

___

THE NUMBERS

Republicans needed a net gain of six seats to win control. They got that, and more.

On Tuesday, 36 seats were contested.

Going into the election, Democrats held a 53-45 Senate majority, with two independents usually backing them.

Tuesday's winners will serve for six years, until the end of the next president's first term.

___

HOW IT UNFOLDED

West Virginia came first as Rep. Shelley Moore Capito defeated Democrat Natalie Tennant in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller. In Arkansas, two-term Sen. Mark Pryor became the first Democratic incumbent to fall, defeated by freshman Rep. Tom Cotton. And in South Dakota, former Gov. Mike Rounds won the third seat for the GOP.

Montana, an open seat, also went to Republicans, and they rolled up another hoped-for prize, a turnover in Colorado, where GOP Rep. Cory Gardner defeated incumbent Sen. Mark Udall.

Brown's loss in New Hampshire gave Democrats reason to cheer.

But then North Carolina, the most expensive Senate race in the nation, went to Thom Tilllis, speaker of the state House, in a defeat for incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, and it was game over for the Democratic majority.

___

HISTORY IS MADE

In South Carolina, GOP Sen. Tim Scott easily won election, becoming the first black senator elected from the South since Reconstruction

Appointed to the Senate after the resignation of Jim DeMint in 2013, Scott won the seat in his own right.

___

KANSAS GOES FOR ROBERTS

In Kansas, Roberts won re-election despite a strong push by Orman in a state where the Democratic candidate dropped out. Roberts found himself in an unexpectedly close race after he came under fire for being out of touch with the state.

Georgia, another question mark, also stayed in the GOP column.

___

EYES ON IOWA

Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst defeated Democratic U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley in a feisty contest enlivened with TV ads about castrating hogs.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada had called the outcome of that race critical.

But it wasn't needed to clinch GOP control.

___

WHY IT MATTERS

The Republican takeover of the Senate is sure to complicate President Barack Obama's agenda in his final two years in office.

But it also raises expectations that Republicans use their dual legislative majorities to govern, not just hold up what Obama wants to do.

Yet the dynamics that have produced so much gridlock in Washington still exist.

Obama could veto GOP legislation.

Senate Democrats could employ the same delaying tactics on GOP initiatives that Republicans have been using against them.

___

RIC'S TWO CENTS WORTH

POTUS keeps reminding us he has a pen and a phone.

Will the Republican held Congress be sufficient to hold his agenda in check-or are there "National Emergencies" scripted and waiting to allow him to "martial" in a virtual Dictatorship?

If so, does this Congress have the chutzpah to reign that in-even to the point of impeachment if necessary?

Will the Republican victors start turning more of an ear to the surprising number of former Obama/Democratic Supporters that gave them this mandate? 

Needed:

(1) Real Investment in Programs that invigorate Small Business, Family Farms and reduce the cost of higher Education-ALL factors in REAL Job Creation.

(2) End the "War on Drugs", the proliferation of militarization in Law Enforcement, and reining in the "Prison Industry".

(3) Real Campaign Finance Reform, the end of "Citizens United" and "Dark Money" used in Campaigns AND for fighting citizen-backed initiatives.

(4) Bring an end to the "Swinging Door" Factor within our Courts and other Branches of Government.

There's NO WAY such people can ever serve "We The People" after serving the interests of Big Business, Banks, and Wall Street.

(5) Return Transparency to the negotiations for Trade Deals, like the TTIP and TTP-both of which are being negotiated in secret.

Such Deals Impact the quality of life here on every level, as we have seen in the aftermath of NAFTA.

NAFTA promised much, and not only fell short in the delivery, but cost us jobs, profits and tax revenues.

(6) End the hiatus of tax havens off-shore for American Businesses.

The test should NOT be whether the HQ or the majority of manufacturing is elsewhere, but where the business originated from.

Businesses have over $32 Trillion in untaxed assets off-shore.

IF they want to keep that, they should then pay tariffs on the goods and services that come into this country.

These things are just for "starters".

There IS much more, but this would win the hearts of "We The People", if the GOP REALLY wants a "Clean Sweep" come 2016.

He really has been the classic back fire for the democratic party. Everything he pushes for turns to shit and nobody in their party wants to be seen as part of it. 
[deleted]
Was he any more of a backfire for the Democrats than Bush was for us? The Democrats could have done the same thing back in 2008 except included the presidency as well. 
I think it depends on who wins the presidency. If we vote Republican for president I think GOP will hold on pretty well to their seats.
I'm going to upvote you because you're probably right, although I hate to admit it.  We'd have been better off if this momentum came in 2016.
So RED, looks like a Bull market.  

I do wonder whether this will end up highlighting differences within the party more, though.  Hope everyone can work together for some much needed strengthening!
The left is already hoping for the Democrats in Congress to embrace gridlock once again. And Obama is defiant and not looking to compromise, instead he's looking to "seek common ground". Obama will do more things through executive orders and regulations and that will anger Republicans. Domestically not much will happen unless Obama decides to change his approach to politics and becomes interested in compromising. 
He better be careful about 'executive orders.'  He's on some shaky ground there.  Just may get in severe hot water.  

Do you think this will make a Republican presidential candidate less likely?  
&gt; He better be careful about 'executive orders.' He's on some shaky ground there. Just may get in severe hot water. 

He's probably going to use one to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. 

&gt;Do you think this will make a Republican presidential candidate less likely? 

It's a big game. It's up to the Republicans to not allow the left to define them like they were defined in 2008 and 2012. They need to stand for something. Ironically, some of the very people who do try to stand for something are guys like Ted Cruz who the party establishment hates. Chris Christie has done a very good job standing up for his values and principles but I'm not sure if he'd be a winner in a national race. 
might as well throw in John McCain as VP or Sec Defense
Are Republicans pro concussion?

No, Republicans are not pro concussion. Concussions affect people's mental ability. Concussions can be bad enough that it makes people mentally disabled. Dear God concussions make people liberal Democrats!

[deleted]
That amnesty move is troubling.  Seems like there should be a way to better  prepare a person for citizenship, not allow unproductive people citizenship, and withhold voting rights until ensuring that they have an American perspective on freedoms, rights, and responsibilities.

Cruz seems to be a good candidate.  I'm still listening to everyone.  


This kind of tactic has been very successful and has turned us into a regulatory state.   The federal government is not supposed to be there to prevent us from hurting ourselves.

In a free country should the government prevent you from playing a game where there is a possibility of injury or death?

Do it for the children.  You're not for our new law?  You must hate children, you monster.
Cruz is an interesting one. He's really as bright guy and he does not care if he pisses off lots of people including those in his own party. Politically he's as talented as anyone the right has produced since Reagan, intellectually he's as smart as Romney IMO. His experience is better than Obama's but not sufficient if I was to pick my guy. I like executive experience. Romney's my ideal candidate. 

"Republicans will use their new dominance of Congress to repeal or cut back President Barack Obama's health care reforms,"

YES!!!

" . . .approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline"
 YES!!!

" . . . and trim the nation's debt, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Thursday."

"'I've made clear to the president, that if he acts unilaterally, on his own, outside of his authority, he will poison the well and there will be no chance of immigration reform moving in this Congress. It's as simple as that,' Boehner said."

Good !!! 


He made an ass of himself with that speech. Bravado and grandstanding will always be a part of politics but he should know better how to handle himself. 

Right now he should be playing the role of diplomat.

When you win you don't go spitting on your enemy with thinly veiled "fu's" especially when you claim you want to work with the other party. You graciously congratulate them, enjoy your moment of success remembering not to get arrogant and then work with them on finding common ground.

You don't start off with threats you start with an olive branch.
[deleted]
I think this exact reaction by Boehner will be reflective of the Republican party this term after this recent win. This worries me for the future of the party.
Why are you personally excited about these things?

Obamacare has insured literal millions of people, there is no plan to reinsure them from republicans. 

The CEO responsible for Keystone XL is on record in canadian parliament talking about the need for Keystone. He expects it to drive up gasoline prices in the Midwest as right now there is a glut of oil. The plan is to refine the oil into diesel in Louisianna, and then ship that diesel to the european union where it will fetch a higher price. 

IE the end game of Keystone XL is higher gas prices for Americans according to the guy who wants to build it.

I'm not really sure why you would support either agenda.
I feel left out living in Buffalo, a almost completely PrObama city. :(
Good to see a Republican takeover though.
I am personally excited about these things because I have both good sense and moral values. Thats why im not a liberal. 


Uhh that's not really so much a policy position as an excuse to avoid detailing one. 

How is it good sense to uninsure 30 million americans? What is the moral uprightness of preventing people from getting medical care?

Why is it good sense for Americans to support a project that will ultimately raise the price of gas, which will increase the cost of nearly all goods nationwide. 
Seems like a dangerous precedent for him to try and set. Rush as well as people like Jon Stewart make their living from taking people out of context.
From the article:  

"Upon reading a post-election article in which the NAACP is all fired up about supposed black voter suppression, my response was, when will these people ever seriously do something to help black people?  Folks, I am sorry, but the NAACP and others in their civil rights syndicate are a despicable bunch.  All they really care about is furthering liberalism and increasing their political power.  They are disgusting.

In their typical ploy of "we know we can count on the MSM to help us play black voters and portray Republicans as the modern KKK," the NAACP and their race-baiting posse are insisting that the newly elected Congress pass a robust Voting Rights Act Amendment.


Yes, heaven knows we black folks desperately need that.  Why waste time and resources on fixing trivial things like black-on-black crime, blacks aborting themselves into extinction, epidemic high school dropouts, black baby daddies outnumbering fathers, and record-high black unemployment under Obama? Let's triple down on our efforts to create victim mindsets in blacks and racial hate.  That will surely empower and enhance the lives of blacks.

Every time the NAACP and their MSM suck-ups launch another of their deplorable whitey-is-out-to-getcha narratives such as that black voters were disenfranchised during this election, it is shrouded in an we're-smarter-than-you arrogance.  Not only are these vile people feeding us a load of crap, but they are superior about it."
How can you write this when by almost every metric the country is much better now than it was in 2009? Americans are truly stupid. No memory.

From the article:
“'This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay, so it’s written to do that.  In terms of risk rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in – you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed… Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really really critical for the thing to pass…'"

I know right? Limbaugh is an insane hypocrite for suing the DCCC for defamation. Ultimately even with the context of the entire episode in which he said that no can mean yes sometimes "if you know how to spot it" doesnt make what he said any less appalling. It's nauseating to think that people actually listen to his show. 
National Propaganda Radio give you the knowledge of all the horseshit that is being hand fed by the liberal media machine. It's good to tune in so you can learn more about the day to day statist agenda. 
[deleted]
My question to OP: do you honestly think that republicans of reddit don't get their news and information from sources from Sean Hannity? By their nature, you can assume that those of us on Reddit expose ourselves daily to a wide variety of news sources, just as you must. Simply because we don't swallow the bullshit we are spoon-fed doesn't mean we don't listen or have perspective. While you may think this is not applicable to most republicans, think about who you are actually talking to in this medium. 

Also, I do often switch between several channels of talk including NPR and it is pretty blatantly leftist. Thanks for playing though.
I just had a Diane Rehm flashback and it wasn't pretty.

I tried my best to listen to NPR thinking they would be an unbiased source for a complete news story vs. a bunch of cute sound bites about nonsense  stories.  But when the Boston marathon event took place and NPR on-the-air declared every conservative to be a terrorist I gave up NPR and PBS to never return.
I do listen to NPR, but certainly not everyday, it would be brain washing. I do like to hear all viewpoints. Then i make sense of it all.
Only thing worth listening to on NPR is CarTalk 
seriously? Son, you need to stop thinking like a liberal. Those of us who are adults have based our political choices on facts and morals and truth. That's why we are not liberals.

I listen to All Things Considered most days. I have for years.  I live in the country and I have a long drive home.  Sometimes I listen to NPR on my way into work. Sometimes I don't.  I like some of the things they do. 

I think it's important to hear the liberal side of things. Sometimes I have to turn them off because they're so stinkin liberalthey are  bearable; for example when they are speaking about Israel. I listen to them before and after the recent elections and laughed right out loud.


Just for your information, conservatives are informed people. Another reason why we are conservatives and not liberals. Conservatives live in the real world. 


Personally I am a news junkie. I ignore completely and totally MSNBC because they're a bunch of lying hypocritical thugs. 

Everyday I check Drudge, Yahoo News, USA Today, Fox News, NewsBusters, The Daily Caller, Town Hall, American Thinker, NPR, and ABC News. I have apps to all of those sites except Town Hall and NewsBusters on the phone. I checked Town Hall and NewsBusters anf American Thinker on the phone but I don't have an app where I can go directly to them. In fact if you go to those other news sources you're going to find that I comment on most of those places too. 

Liberals are not anywhere near as informed as most conservatives. 

People are not conservative because they do not know what's going on. People are conservative because they're not immoral nor are they stupid. 

Liberals do not know what's going on. Liberals are uninformed people. Liberals live in the world of fantasy.  

Did you know one of those brothers died?
I listen to Planet Money on the way to work.
been there, done that.  it's 98% agenda "reporting", e.g. global warming

and what are you doing in this sub anyway?
Yeah I know, it's sad

I agree.  I like classical music.
He should pull himself up by his bootstraps. 
From the article:

"The 2014 midterms were more than an average election. They were more than simply a rejection of Obama and his schemes, more than a flogging for the Democrats, more than a simple party shift like 1994. Put aside control of both Senate and House, a near sweep of governorships, and a vastly larger GOP footprint in the statehouses. This year’s midterms marked the third -- and perhaps final -- rejection of the progressive program in the past century."

"The slow collapse of the Marxist imperial states should have demonstrated clearly that progressivism, was neither scientific, nor rational, nor inevitable. It was a system based on deprivation and misery with a definite, and very short, half-life. An ideology operating in defiance of human nature, which has its own form of rationality and operates by its own rules despite any and all attempts to systemize it."



I am a dog lover. This story worries me. It makes me reconsider my idea of putting any dog in a kennel while vacationing. Very worrisome article. 

But this article brings up another important point. Many people in the comments section are very upset about the cruelty shown to these dogs. They should be. 

Still I am wondering how many of you who are upset that these dogs were tortured and killed do not mind abortion. How many people that attended the vigil for these poor dogs are also pro aborts? 

Many are very upset about cruelty to animals. They should be. There's no excuse for that. But the same people who are all up in arms about cruelty to animals are often the very same people who demand the right to murder their own unborn child. Can one spell hypocrite? 

Those of you who are upset about the death of these animals yet still support the murder of the unborn are the worst kind of hypocrite. You are the top of the list hypocrite. You reek of hypocrisy. This is definitely a prime example of people who call evil good. 


Some people cannot stand honesty.
From the article:

"That's because a number of low-priced Obamacare plans will raise their rates in 2015, making those options less affordable. On top of that, penalties for failing to secure a health-insurance plan will rise steeply next year, which could take a big bite out of some families' pocketbooks."
you mean the new imported voters?
I wonder how they will enforce those penalties. I stopped paying my BC/BS plan when it went up $85/month (i'm a student, btw, but would have had to pay more to cover less - it removed dental and vision, but I can "keep my plan if I like it"!) and now only have the vision and dental, but no health care. I have someone else do my taxes and if he/she were to ask if I bought a plan I'd say yes. How would anyone ever know if I wasn't in the system? I suppose they could look it up, but they'd have to be looking up all 330 million legal U.S. citizens
You misspelled 'undocumented Democrats'.
Good question. I guess it would be like any other input on the tax form you could lie about (income, charitable contributions, deductions). You just have to hope you aren't audited by the time irs. But after doing some research your very unlikely to be audited because as you said "330 million legal us citizens"
Totally. The other half of that is I'm a student too, no income, no capital gains, minimal blips on the radar, so I *should* get run out in the wash, knock on wood. And if there IS a penalty I dunno if I could even pay it. Whatever, I know the people next door to my apt are here not legally, so that bus is gonna have to go over them before it gets to me
My deductible and premium just went up, again. Fuck you Obama.

Halal is deliberately brutal, designed to inflict as much pain and suffering upon the animal as possible, and I wouldn't eat it for that reason.  Forcing the other animals who are next to watch others being slaughtered in this fashion makes it even worse.  So, 1 big point for Gellar there.

Walmart caved to political pressure in this case, no question about it, so her other point is equally valid.

Turns out that this week's story was about 1 Walmart store.  A handful of other Walmart stores have been carrying Halal meat for years.

I just want to remind folks here that Walmart is a business whose primary obligation is to their stockholders.  One of the ways in which Walmart satisfies this obligation is by stocking items that sell.

In areas where demand is high, they might see a legitimate business reason to stock something (as was the case with the locations which sold Halal meat because of demand, not out of fear of being branded Islamophobes).

It's the exact same reason they don't sell too many snow shovels in Miami.  Now, this Walmart store will be forced to carry food items which will mostly spoil and have to be thrown away for a loss.

If OP agrees with the author's premise that the only difference between Halal and Kosher is the religion of the people who eat it, he is not only very, very wrong, but also fails to recognize the fact that Muslims are allowed to eat Kosher meat.  I do not understand how Gellar's pointing out the facts makes her a racist/Islamophobe.
Read the first letter and rather than argue against the points made by a student the article talks about her Facebook likes. This blatantly shit writing really shouldn't be on this subreddit.
Best to actually READ an article before commenting.  Keeps you from looking silly.  
Impressive rhetorical non-response.
From the article:

"The promises he made that night were many and, to most in the television audience, at least, sounded fresh.  'Nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have,” said the president.  “Let me repeat this: nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.'"

"Simmering throughout this litany of disinformation was an obscure five-term South Carolina congressman named Joe Wilson.  When Obama denounced as false the claim that this proposed health care system “would insure legal immigrants,” Wilson could hold his tongue no longer.  “You lie!” he yelled."

"Widely chastised at the time, Wilson had to feel vindicated this week when a report surfaced that 42 percent of new Medicaid sign-ups were immigrants, legal and otherwise.  This added weight to the recent revelation that most of those newly insured for Obamacare had been insured through Medicaid."

"It has been a good few weeks for Wilson. On November 4, he handily won re-election to Congress from South Carolina’s 2nd congressional district with nearly two thirds of the vote.  A week later, the remarks made by MIT professor and self-styled Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber at a 2013 academic conference sobered up those who preferred to think Obama’s broken health care promises were unfortunate but unforeseen."


Point?  Obama really is nothing more than a wicked lying piece of trash. A whole lot of people old Joe Wilson apology. He was right. Obama was lying ride out his face that very night this occurred. Obama knew he was lying through his teeth then a very night Joe Wilson called him a liar publicly. Joe Wilson was right.

I'm going to be posting a couple things on this topic today. This is a very important issues.

 Everybody needs to understand what's going on with this EO. 

 Most importantly,  Obama needs to understand we do not have a king. We as Americans do not want a king. We have three branches of government for a reason. the reason is not sounding fathers rightly wanted to make sure that no one had too much power. They wanted to make sure that we would really be a representative government.

The presidency does not hold the most power. The founding fathers set it up that way for a reason. They didn't want a king. That had lived with a king. They wanted to make sure that nobody had that kind of power in this new country. The branch of governent   that should have the most power in the United States the legislative branch, the Congress. That's the branch of government that is supposedly the closest to the people they represent. 

Obama does not get to just decide what he thinks United States needs or is. We have elections because we get to decide what America is or isn't.

From the article:

"We are a nation and people of laws, not of whimsy or capricious acts by self-adulating leaders, not subject to any dictator or the assumption of power by this or that president.  These lines are well-drawn.  The U.S. Supreme Court long ago made the point.  We are not ruled by executive order, never have been, legally and prudentially cannot be, and should not now be.  For any president to believe that he has the power to step upon all these legal and prudential considerations, because he has a pen and a phone, indifference to rule of law, or illusions of unilateral authority is simply misguided."

That's the branch of government that is supposedly the closest to the people they represent. 

Obama does not get to just decide what he thinks United States needs or is. We have elections because we get to decide what America is or isn't.

From the article:

"We are a nation and people of laws, not of whimsy or capricious acts by self-adulating leaders, not subject to any dictator or the assumption of power by this or that president.  These lines are well-drawn.  The U.S. Supreme Court long ago made the point.  We are not ruled by executive order, never have been, legally and prudentially cannot be, and should not now be.  For any president to believe that he has the power to step upon all these legal and prudential considerations, because he has a pen and a phone, indifference to rule of law, or illusions of unilateral authority is simply misguided."

This law also include another rather frightening feature. I'm going to do the best I can explain this correctly.

 I'm from Mexico I have been living in the United States for a number of years. King Obama's new law would make me legal and the United States citizen if I wanted to be. Just by making me legal, it would become legal, according to King Obama's law, for my relatives still in Mexico to now come to United States legally. That would include a husband and children,  parents, grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, and in laws. 

Once tall of my relatives were here then their relatives could also come and become legal citizens and then their relatives could come and become legal citizens and then their relatives could come and become legal citizen and then their relatives could come . . .   do you get the point.  

Just make Mexico a new state. It would be easier and there would be less paperwork.

From the article:

"For every justification based on an illegal alien having a legal U.S. relative, we can now expect that the same argument will be made by the five to seven million newly minted 'instant citizens' or 'instant legal residents.'  In short, one thing all members of humanity – those legal and illegal – have in common is relatives.  Once all those here illegally with relatives make their relatives legal, the newly legal (and formerly illegal) relatives will now declare that they, wonder of wonder, also have relatives – that deserve to be legal.  Ad infinitum."


brilliantly written article. The republican party needs to undergo massive re-alignment or else we face another 2008 in 2 years. 
This is why Republicans need to run a moderate candidate from California, like Arnold could have been had they amended the constitution. Once you have a Republican that can win California, the math completely flips.
Republicans are in a tough space. When it comes to the primary, the candidate has to pander to the hard line conservative Republicans. Being a moderate is almost certainly not going to win you the primary. However, once the general election runs around, the damage has already been done during the primary, so they have a hard time winning over the moderates. It's a catch-22
But we've tried moderates a couple times now and it would appear leftist voters see them as the less-left-leaning and just end up voting for the Democrat. Putting the "moderate"/liberal Republican forward got us McCain and Romney. Yet the only time Republicans have won large victories for President have been with hard right Conservative candidates. I agree we need a change, largely on the social and religious front, but I think you can do that and still be a Conservative . Focus on freedom, Constituionalism, economic growth, small government, lower taxes, and energy independence and I think we could take it back. But if they keep putting establishment progressives like McConnel, Boehner and the Bush's and Romney's and Gingrich's up for debate, and then add on top the people who come off as draconian fanatics like Santorum or Bachmann,  then we'll be on the fast track to another radical progressive regime possibly under a Clinton dynasty or worse.
.From the article:

"The demonstrations and violence that seem almost certain to break out if the grand jury returns no indictment in the death of Michael Brown have been planned for months.  Last week, Lee Cary documented (here, here, here, here, and here) the radical Marxist agenda of groups taking a leadership role in ginning up these demonstrations. "

**Sunday, the New York Times revealed that President Obama personally met with some demonstration leaders and, according to self-ordained “Reverend” Al Sharpton, told them to stay 'on course.”'"**

"In short, we have a well-organized effort to intimidate a grand jury and sow the seeds of racial violence.  Radio talk show host Michael Savage terms this effort a “lynch mob” aimed at Officer Wilson, the Ferguson policeman who shot Michael Brown in the course of a police stop, shortly after surveillance video reveals he (or someone bearing a remarkable resemblance to him) robbed a nearby convenience store."

"
There is no telling how bad it will get when the wheels of justice have turned, and the grand jury issues its report.  But if the forces working to exploit the situation have their way, it will be very, very bad, and serve to take Jonathan Gruber, the IRS scandal, and the Obamacare rate hikes out of the news.  

**As intended, planned, and executed.**
&gt; Putting the "moderate"/liberal Republican forward got us McCain and Romney.

HAHAHA.  They aren't moderates.  McCain 2000 was a moderate; McCain 2008 was not.

It seems you're part of the problem, a Republican who thinks anything to the left of Ayn Rand is a moderate.

Being aware, of how humans affect the environment they depend on to survive, is not insane.

What I find to be a bit despicable is trying to use a new mothers personal search for answers, when she is obviously suffering emotional stress, as some kind of political ball.

I would go so far as to say she seemed to be suffering from postpartum depression. Which would lead her to worry about any number of subjects she cares about.
Blah blah blah.  It's hard to do anything with the party of NO (republicans).  Our economy is better, government spending is down, corporations are making money hand over fist.  How do you base your comment on?  Oh yea, thats right, you like to be spoon fed the false views from faux news.  Go back to drinking the juice.
really?  is that exactly how it read?


Exactly? No, it is pretty much what it does though.
of course others might pretty much see it differently. 
Sure they might. Might is a weak claim. Do you see it differently? Do you think the headline is false? If so what do you think the bill actually does?
It looks like to me that the committees not scientist, have to follow the rules.  I do not see membership limited to or required to be of scientist.

(The Board provides scientific advice to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA].) Prohibits federally registered lobbyists from being appointed to the Board.

Revises the operation of Board member committees and investigative panels to: (1) require that they operate in accordance with the membership, participation, and policy requirements (including new requirements for public participation in advisory activities of the Board) contained in this Act; (2) deny them authority to make decisions on behalf of the Board; and (3) prohibit direct reporting to EPA.

... requiring advice and comments to be included in the record regarding any such proposal and published in the Federal Register....

Prohibits this Act from being construed as supplanting the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act or the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.


I see no smoking monster here.  

You can't believe everything you read on the internet, especially what you read on jagoff sites like Salon.com. Republicans could cure cancer, and Salon would spin it to sound bad.

From the actual text of the bill:

&gt;EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2013 - Amends the Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 to revise the process of selecting members of the Science Advisory Board, guidelines for participation in Board advisory activities, and terms of office. (The Board provides scientific advice to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA].) **Prohibits federally registered lobbyists from being appointed to the Board.**

&gt;Revises the procedures for providing advice and comments to the Administrator by: **(1) including risk or hazard assessments in the regulatory proposals and documents made available to the Board, and (2) requiring advice and comments to be included in the record regarding any such proposal and published in the Federal Register.**

&gt;Revises the operation of Board member committees and investigative panels to: (1) **require that they operate in accordance with the membership, participation, and policy requirements (including new requirements for public participation in advisory activities of the Board) contained in this Act; (2) deny them authority to make decisions on behalf of the Board; and (3) prohibit direct reporting to EPA.**

&gt;Adds guidelines for the conduct of Board advisory activities, including concerning: (1) avoidance of making policy determinations or recommendations, (2) communication of uncertainties, (3) dissenting members' views, and (4) periodic reviews to ensure that such activities address the most important scientific issues affecting EPA.

&gt;Prohibits this Act from being construed as supplanting the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act or the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.


&gt;Revises the operation of Board member committees and investigative panels to:... (3) prohibit direct reporting to EPA.

This is what's fucking everyone up. These investigative panels are largely the scientists. But what the law does, if I understand correctly, is simply keep the scientists from reporting directly to the EPA and instead makes them report to the Board, that then reports to the EPA.... I think.
Just because two GOP presidents did it doesn't mean that it should be supported. I'm at least consistent in my opposition to "immigration reform" and unilateral action in general. I would also like to add that it doesn't surprise me that much of this subreddit along with r/conservatives is empty. Reddit might be entertaining but I don't side with their politics in any regard other than keeping a free internet.  
has any "protester" mentioned **WHAT** they are protesting?
many posts are seen elsewhere

many posts are not controversial/exciting enough to comment

"Obama is an asshole reason #824" = no comment
You obviously didn't read the article, they are protesting being treated like their lives are worthless and like animals. Like anyone with a badge can hunt them done in broad daylight near or in their homes. As someone who is white and that lives in works in Ferguson, MO, even I am terrified of the militaristic and totalitarian state of thus whole region.
Thanks Obama
You're fucking welcome!
Read the article.  sorry, I don't suffer from white guilt. I just do not. I am NOT responsible.  I firmly think this whole idea that these people believe that anybody with a badge can hunt them down any  time is just a bunch of trash. They know better. You know better than that.

millions of us get through an entire lives without ever worrying about any, and this is a very big because, we don't break laws. And that would be the entire crux of the matter. I do not worry about cops hunting me down, because I don't do anything that would make a cop want to hunt me down.

I do crazy things like take care of my family, go to work everyday, obey the laws. Millions of people who do the very same thing also have no problems with police regardless of the color of their skin.
Reddit doesn't upvote ideas that reddit doesn't agree with. 
People subscribe just to down vote submissions.

Other people have jobs.
And the rest are liberal trolls trying to elicit a comment they can then point to to say "See, this is why Rethuglicans are racists/fascists/sexists/whateverists!", and despite their belief, we're actually smart enough to not rise to the bait.
Couldn't agree more. What happened last time? The city became militarized and THEN people looted, destroyed and were violent? Or the other way around? When you take bad news like animals and use that as the impetus for "protesting", then guess what, of course the cops are going to have a field day using their power. Do people get falsely arrested, detained or otherwise harassed by the police in Ferguson? Absolutely. I'd be surprised if it didn't happen. But try some good old fashioned civil disobedience, like those in the 50s and 60s, voting out all the elected officials, etc. Don't loot small businesses (accomplishing what, by the way), destroy property that isn't yours or assault people. It's not that hard

You think ISIS would have come into existence whether or not we invaded Iraq?

And, you also believe that Saddam was manufacturing WMDs and collaborating with terrorists?
Ok,  I now think conspiracy theorists aren't all that crazy. 
ISIS existed before we invaded Iraq. Their original mission was to overthrow the Jordanian Monarchy *[1]*. Iraq had about 500 munitions which are classified as WMDs, mostly Sarin and other types of nerve agents *[2]*. 

Anyway, our invasion of Iraq likely destabilized the nation, but our disengagement was the biggest mistake. It allowed Jihadist groups to get a foothold in both Syria and Iraq, effectively reversing any progress we've made.

Romney as the candidate would be the surest way to elect Hillary as President.

Who would think this is a good idea and why?
Is it therefore your belief that Saddam was attempting to supply terrorists with WMDs?
He's a RINO !
Obama does it = Impeach

Reagan does it = Name an airport after him

He's a RINO !
&gt;crazed on THC
Are you aware that the condition of those weapons is reported as "degraded", that they are pre-gulf war munitions? Do you accept that Bush lied when he said that Saddam was *manufacturing* WMDs?
You're misusing the word 'lie'. If intelligence reports show that there is a very high likelihood of WMDs being manufactured, then he isn't lying when he reiterates that. Being wrong isn't the same as lying.
So it was merely a failure to operate a competent intelligence network?
The main intelligence agency in the US is independent. 
Sure, but you blame American Intelligence and not the president? Even though the United Nations said it was wrong, and most of the developed world agreed it was wrong and it was ultimately Bush who insisted that it was true and was willing to stake a few trillion dollars on it. 
From the article:

" If it found there was insufficient evidence for an indictment against Darren Wilson, it would mean that the American justice system was corrupt, unjust, and rife with racism. If the grand jury decided to move forward with an indictment, it could only mean that American law enforcement was corrupt, unjust, and rife with racism."

"Even if many of your grievances are legitimate, 'justice' doesn’t exist to soothe your anger. In the end, there wasn’t probable cause to file charges against Wilson."

I sincerely doubt this. If Romney or Jeb go for presidency in 2016 we can give it up to Clinton already. 
If Elizabeth Warren go for presidency you can give it up with whomever y'all run.
The thing about warren that worries me is how she seems to be a populist. She says what folk think and want to hear but rarely follows it up with meaningful action.
Give me an example.

I'm a registered republican who hates conservatives. Shit like this is exactly why. 

The author of this article brought up an idea.  It  pointed out that there is one aspect of this story that nobody wants to mention or acknowledge. And that aspect is that both of these young men wanted to get high. Nobody wants to acknowledge the part marijuana and getting stoned played in Michael Brown's death. 

From the article: 


"Brown, 18, and Johnson, 22, had only known each other a few months when they bumped into each other in a parking lot outside their Ferguson, Missouri, apartment building, **but they had awoken Aug. 9 with the same bad idea: Let's get high. All they needed were cigarillos to make a blunt."**

" 'When I told him I was going to get cigarillos, he was like, 'I need one, too. Let's walk to the store,' Johnson recalled in testimony."

In an nation who likes to pretend that marijuana is not a problem. In a nation that is fighting to legalize marijuana, nobody wants to talk about the part marijuana played in Michael Brown's dying. If he hadn't wanted to get stoned, he'd probably still be alive.

It was not the desire to ingest Cannabis that is the catalyst here, had Brown NOT STOLEN the cigarillos is.

Looks like Ted may not be 'too right wing' for a certain donor after all. 

FTA:

&gt; The day before that appearance, a news report revealed that the summit’s underwriter had backed a Lebanese politician allied with Hezbollah, the terrorist group. Cruz recounted Sunday night that he scrapped his schedule to spend four or five hours debating with aides whether to back out of the appearance. He decided to go ahead, to shine a spotlight on the persecution of both Christians and Jews in the Middle East.
&gt; 
&gt; “But if I was going to go and stand with people who might be defenders of Hezbollah, there was not going to be one whit of ambiguity about where I stood,” Cruz said. So, he recounted, when he asserted that “those who hate Israel hate America,” and the boos began, “I had no choice but to say, ‘If you will not stand with Israel, and you will not stand with the Jews, then I will not stand with you.’”
&gt; 
&gt; At this point in New York, the chants began: “Run, Ted, run!”
&gt;

&gt;Among those standing in ovation was casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a GOP megadonor who met privately with Cruz the next day. Adelson, who largely bankrolled Newt Gingrich’s 2012 bid for president, reportedly found Cruz too right-wing for his taste but clearly welcomed his Zionism.

&gt;“His time will come,” said one dinner attendee, Ferne Hassan, a pro-Israel activist from Union, N.J. “If it’s not in 2016, it will come.”

I live in FL.  I've met Jeb.  I have friends in "the circle".  he's [not conservative](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/12/02/Jeb-Bush-Republicans-Don-t-Need-Conservatives-to-Win-White-House-Should-Not-Defund-Exec-Amnesty)
He most certainly is a conservative. Perhaps you're just an extremist and a zealot? 
you obviously didn't read the piece/quotes in my last reply, so you won't send links of his total embracement of blanket amnesty

the two together = proof positive **NOT NOT NOT** conservative
So according to you Ronald Reagan wasn't even a conservative. Who was the last conservative president then? Calvin Coolidge? 
Hillary won't get past the primaries (but I hope she does)

and that's **IF** she runs at all
Dude. Maybe. But that would be like choosing between getting kicked in the balls and getting kicks in the balls twice.
Jeb Bush would be a fantastic president. Not as good of a choice as Romney would be, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better candidate than Mitt!

Not really. Hillary's by far the "best case" scenario if we have to put up with another Democrat. Jeb's a good choice as well, but I still would rather see Romney!
I think Mitt would make a great president, but he makes a shit candidate. He doesn't have the personality or the presence to whip people into a frenzy the way other candidates do.
Mitt's the thinking man's Republican nominee. As we saw with the "war on big bird" and other nonsense attacks from the other side, most voters aren't thinking people. 

Still, as President Romney would get shit done.

but, things will be maneuvered to avoid such head on collisions
I honestly can't think of any of my conservative friends that would support another Bush. This idea that Jeb is now the front runner seems to only exist in manufactured headlines of news stories.

Here's the poll they're getting all of this from: http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2014/images/12/24/poll2.pdf

I don't know what it is, but something smells.  Half of their questions are about Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.  They say Republicans want Jeb Bush, but when Republicans are asked about Jeb Bush's policies they react negatively.
I don't like Jeb Bush. I don't want to see another Bush or Clinton as president, ever. This is another case of the media trying to pick the opponent for the Democrat to run against. They know Jeb can't win. 
Nay, he is an ignorant republican. 
We need better healthcare, I hope he shits his pants. 
no chance in hell i would vote for him
Don't forget door #3.

Republicans, being conservative, go with what's worked in the past.  The GOP hasn't won a Presidential election without a Bush or Nixon on the ticket since Hoover in **1928.**  (Eisenhower's VP was Nixon. Reagan's VP was Bush I.)

Nixon [has a grandson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nixon_Cox) with an undergraduate degree in politics, a law degree, worked in John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, and ran for Congress in 2010.  Endorsed by Jeb Bush.

But he needs a few months in Congress or as a governor before being seen as qualified.  So until 2020, Republicans are stuck with Jeb.

There are atleast 100 million people in this country qualified to be president. We don't "need" a Bush. I don't agree at all. 
Thank you for speaking my mind as well. #NoJebBush
&gt; so Bush-3 thinks he can stand up to a toe-to-toe debate with a conservative

Well, let's be honest, that's a pretty low bar, as far as debating goes.
He's great at this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WztB6HzXxI
because he wanted to catch Santa in the act?
Only way Jeb succeeds is if he gets a sympathy vote for his beloved dad, especially if God forbid something happens to him. 

But just imagine that people, having ANOTHER president bush hanging over America. Just imagine it. 
the media wants Bush vs Clinton 2: Electric Boogaloo. 
This is nice:

" ... the maxim—attributed, apocryphally, to the former Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen—that there are two parties in Washington, the stupid party and the evil party, who occasionally get together and do something both stupid and evil, and this is called bipartisanship. "
What does being a Christian Conservative have to do with not supporting this? As a human being, NO one should support this. 
Because there are those who will label you a racist for having Conservative views. 

Most Conservatives completely disagree with Obama. Since he's black, this apparently makes you racist.

I've even seen *Liberal* blacks who criticize Obama called "Uncle Toms".

Or how about Ferguson? If you point out that Michael Brown was a thug and that he probably brought it on himself, you're racist. If you say anything about rioters destroying their own neighborhood, you're racist.

At least that's how some people look at it.

Of course, a lot of the Liberals here on Reddit will deny it.
Throwing rocks through windows with racial slurs written on the rocks... that has nothing to do with Christians or Conservatives.
He's got no chance.

That doesn't sound like an American name to me, son!  That's Español for 'cross'.

Larger than I thought.
The 'Republican' party's platform is currently wide enough to house most Americans who want to see the US thrive.  But this strength can also be it's greatest weakness.  It has seemed to me that in the last couple elections the potential support base has become divided on more minor issues, exposing that the Achilles heel of conservative politics tends to be the natural tendency of conservatives to gravitate to inflexible applications in matters of conscience.  Hopefully a Republican candidate with a strong internal core and broad-ranging personal appeal will *communicate* messages that are both 'deep and wide.'  

I agree that Huckabee is an example of more partisan applications who may serve to block Jeb from negative entanglements. However it would be even better if he were an obvious front-runner appealing in areas that unify.  He's got to tweak his message into inspirational capsules.


 

I think the "base" people would be foolish to support anyone but Ted Cruz. 

Huckabee running is great news for Jeb
&gt;However it would be even better if he were an obvious front-runner appealing in areas that unify. He's got to tweak his message into inspirational capsules.

I wasn't clear:  this was about Jeb.  

So, you think Huckabee is more likely to divide Cruz' support than Jeb's?
Huckabee's support is quite narrow. It's almost entirely among the "religious right". Cruz has probably the strongest appeal among the Mark Levin/Rush Limbaugh audience, but he's also got appeal to religious voters and various other "base" constituencies. He's an incredibly intelligent person and a great debater as well. Huck sucks away some of Cruz's support. The more "non-establishment" candidates are in the race the harder it will be for one of them to win the thing. 

The *real* base, the ones who are not incredibly politically active but who are larger in number than the "base" people often think about, will fall in line behind someone more moderate. They always do. Between the less politically active "base" conservatives and crossover independent/Democrat voters in certain states the right-wing has a lot to overcome in order to get one of their guys to win the nomination.

If they were smart they'd fall behind Ted Cruz sooner than later. The Paultards, who will undoubtedly vote for Gary Johnson in November, will stick with Rand Paul in the primaries no matter what. They'll spam and money-bomb enough donations into Rand's camp to keep him running longer than he should and he'll draw away some of that support that Cruz needs. If a big part of the religious right breaks for Huckabee then Cruz loses more of the supporters he needs in order to overcome the Romney/McCain voters. 

It should be interesting to watch everything unfold. 
[deleted]
I enjoy your analysis on these things.  

I wonder though how Jeb's candidacy effects Romney's then.  Cruz *is* intelligent and a great debater.  



I don't think Romney will run if Jeb runs. Romney would prefer someone like that wins and knows that if he jumped in he might give the tea party a chance to win the nomination. 
[deleted]
What do you think of Cruz' comments that if it's Bush against Clinton, he would lose?  

This is sort of where my first comment comes into play.  Sure, the moderates seem to end up representing the party, but they don't seem to win against democrats.  I think this has something to do with leadership styles that emerge from strong core beliefs.  Reagan came across moderate because of his previous affiliation with the Democrat party, but he was a unifier who had pretty strong beliefs and a very personable demeanor.  
&gt; What do you think of Cruz' comments that if it's Bush against Clinton, he would lose? 

The base believes this. They keep pointing back to Reagan. There was a lot of doubt about Reagan's candidacy until he actually won. They say that the Republicans come close but lose when they don't stand for conservatism, but if they stand for conservatism and give the people a real choice they'll win. 

They'll keep saying this until they are proven wrong. 
Isn't it more about which issues are conservative and how it is all packaged?  It does seem that conservatives often fracture over peripheral issues.  Not that the issues are themselves not important, but that they are areas of conscience which perhaps do not need extensive government intervention.  

The last candidates were more moderate and they lost.
Conservatives are more interested in either preserving the current order or rolling things back a little. The left sees so many things as crisis level, or the "moral equivalent to war". The right only has so many issues they are this passionate about. Abortion, taxes, and gun rights are probably the top issues. Some reforms like school choice get broad support from the right, but the left usually tries to undermine that in any way. For one, because of the unions, but also because "school choice" sometimes means giving parents vouchers they could then redeem at parochial schools. They think it violates the so-called "separation of church and state". Ultimately the activist left wants to destroy religion so this is a huge deal to them. We still allow the government to give grants and stuff to kids who wish to attend religious colleges. It's not the end of the world if we allow *well regulated* religious schools to compete with publicly run schools for the students. 

The left just has a ton of issues they obsess over that the right doesn't worry that much about. 

The right wants to preserve the current order or "restore our founding principles". The left seeks to push us towards European style Social Democracy and secularism. 
Yeah, I agree about top issues.  Of course government regulated health care has become a big issue as well.  I think the biggest problem with this is managing the bloated insurance companies and limiting private choice. There is some reform necessary.

The vouchers worry some potential private schools as well, because they don't want to open their programs to government interference.  Of course a protective clause could be incorporated to protect that from happening outside of criminal offenses.

It's crazy how the left *appeals* on the basis of freedom and choice, but so often ends up instigating less freedom and choice.




The usual Republican position on this is that the healthcare industry, while still the best in the world, didn't get so damn expensive and convoluted until after the government stepped in to try and fix everything. 

The Flex accounts and High Deductible Health Plans with Health Savings Accounts were passed by George W Bush, a moderate Republican. Those are good steps in the right direction. 

The Democratic Party is without question the anti-choice, centralized control party. They side with "choice" on ethical issues like abortion but on most issues they are firmly against choice and competition. Some on reddit would but in with "but but but the Affordable Care Act" or something else, but they fail to understand all this stuff is incremental steps in the direction the left wishes. They even said that the ACA was a step that would lead to their goal of single payer. 

I'm a little in between. I do think some of the stuff the left has done is good. Medicare and Social Security among them. But I do support the Republicans over the Democrats. 
&gt;I'm a little in between. I do think some of the stuff the left has done is good. Medicare and Social Security among them.

I think, me too.  But then again, that's because once those programs were started, there are people depending on them.  Also, they work better in small venues where there isn't so much bureaucracy.  

I didn't think of George W Bush as *moderate* as much as fair minded.
&gt; I think, me too. But then again, that's because once those programs were started, there are people depending on them. 

There really were old people who'd live in pathetic conditions before social security. I also think that the private accounts option was an OK idea so long as it's regulated. 

&gt;I didn't think of George W Bush as moderate as much as fair minded.

Yeah, I agree with that.

This is the type of crap that creates conspiracy theorists. Fox was pushing Romney vs Jeb Bush.

Really? The Loser vs the "Legacy" (using Frat terminology?)

Ignoring Cruz, Carson, Jindal and many others?
The social dynamic has changed, a lot. 

Republicans had a lot of victories this midterm election, on the state and local levels. 

Why?

Because a lot of newer, younger candidates with conservative and moderate values were supported by the party. Furthermore, many of these candidates were from very diverse backgrounds: veterans, 1st generation Americans, people in their mid to late 20s, etc etc. It was a far more diverse lineup than what the democrats had, yet we did not push diversity as an issue. 

If we want to be successful in 2016, than we should push for candidates that are focused on the economy, and preparing it for the HUGE advances in automation that are about to hit. 
Not to sound like a dick, but I won't vote for him just because he's a Mormon. Anyone who believes that crap is brainwashed. Don't trust them!

[deleted]
they also cheated, measures such as voter fraud claims, requiring voter IDs, long voting lines, the elimination of early voting and the gutting of the 1965 Voting Rights Act were deployed to rig elections even before votes were cast, add gerrymandering and what you get is 52 percent of the vote but 57 percent of seats.
And what is so different between being Mormon and every Christian president we've ever had?
Seriously, I don't understand that logic of "he's not a 'real' Christian." Mormons themselves are really not so bad. If there's any politician who values family like they do, that will already put them on my good side.

Still not sure I'd vote for him, though. Too early to call.
The voter id laws are a huge joke, even a utility bill counts as an id for voting. I know because i am in one of those states with the laws. In all seriousness, the only purpose for passing those laws is to give the appearance of work, as fixing an imaginary problem and being very public about it is what all politicians are about. 

I find it very hard to believe that the id laws are disenfranchising people. You expect me to believe that  there are that many people out there that do not: drive, buy alcohol, buy tobacco, or cash paychecks?  Not only is the law pointless, not only is it fixing a problem that does not exist, but its not even disenfranchising anyone. Its as if the establishment politicians thought it up in the hopes of causing partisan strife in both sides and prevent people from asking real questions. 

The gerrymandering has been going on for years, and is done by both parties, and BOTH parties fight laws stopping it tooth and nail. 


I honestly really think we can do better.
How?
You know the sunnis say the same thing about the shia. Good to know that in America we aren't really that much better than them.
I don't know, but I think we still ***can*** do better.
You'd have to really reorganize thnRepyblican party platform and be prepared to lose a huge percentage of your base, ie Tea Party folks.

How Congress Rang in the New Year
Kicking the Disabled

by DEAN BAKER | JAN 15, 2015  

Tens of millions of people made New Year’s resolutions, but few were as creative as the one pushed through Congress last week. 

Apparently, the new Congress decided that its first order of business should be to go after workers who are no longer able to hold jobs due to injury or illness.

It did this in a technical move that is likely to escape the attention of most of the public. 

The Republican Congress voted to ban any reallocation of Social Security tax revenue between the retirement fund, designated for retirees and survivors, and the disability fund for disabled workers. 

This matters because the disability fund is projected to face a shortfall some time in 2016. 

If no steps are taken by that point, workers suffering from cancer, heart disease, or other disabling conditions will see their benefits cut by almost 20 percent.

The easiest way to have addressed this problem would be to simply reallocate money between the funds, as has been done eleven times in the past. 

But the Republican Congress apparently felt that it would be better to hold disabled workers hostage in order to extract concessions on this or other programs.

Just for a bit orientation, the disability program is an insurance program that workers pay into. 

There are currently just under 9 million people getting disability benefits. 

The average benefit is $1,150 a month. 

It is financed by a tax of 1.8 percentage points of earnings, up to $118,500.

The projections had shown the program facing a long-term shortfall for some time, but its problems were moved forward by the Great Recession. 

As happens in every downturn, the number of workers collecting disability increased when the economy collapsed.

There are many workers who have various ailments that make it difficult for them to do their jobs. 

In good times their bosses may keep them on the payroll. 

But when economy turns down, a 60-year-old with a bad back or trouble walking is likely to be the first to lose their job.

By not paying workers the full disability benefits to which they are entitled, the government will not only be imposing a serious hardship on millions of workers and their families, it will effectively be defaulting on its obligations. 

It did after all collect payments from these workers, in most cases for several decades.

In recent years there has been a PR campaign to convince the public that the Social Security disability program is riddled with fraud. 

The facts say otherwise. 

Three quarters of applicants are turned down on their initial application, and even after appeals, 60 percent of applicants are denied benefits.

A recent study published by the University of Michigan examined a group of marginal disability applicants. 

These were people who could be approved or denied depending on the examiner to which they were assigned. 

This group comprised 23 percent of all applicants. 

The study found that two years after the decision on eligibility, an additional 28 percentage points of the people denied benefits were working compared to those who got benefits. 

After three years, this gap fell to just over 20.0 percentage points. 

Furthermore, the average wage of the people who worked was less than half of their wage before applying to disability.

These results indicate that even from this marginal group of applicants, the overwhelming majority would not be working even if denied benefits, indicating that they are suffering from serious health problems. 

If that is the case with marginal applicants, it is reasonable to assume that few among the 77 percent of non-marginal beneficiaries would be able to work.

This doesn’t mean there is no fraud. 

Any program with 9 million beneficiaries will have some fraud. 

However the costs of the disability program are not being driven by fraud; they are being driven by workers who are no longer able to work.

While the easiest path to maintain full benefits would have been to reallocate some of the surplus from the Social Security retirement program, it would not be a huge lift to make up the shortfall with additional revenue. 

The cap on taxable wages could be raised above $118,500, which would make up some of the shortfall. 

Alternatively, an increase in the payroll tax of 0.2 percentage points on both workers and employers would fully close the gap.

While no one will want to pay higher taxes, a tax increase of this magnitude is not likely to pose a serious hardship. 

For a worker earning $40,000 a year it would mean an increase in taxes of $1.60 a week on both the worker and the employer. 

This tax increase is one-fifth the size of the increase that took effect in January of 2013.

It would have been best to have this discussion when the economy had more fully recovered and ideally wage growth had resumed. 

If wages were growing 1.0-1.5 percent a year, workers could still see higher pay even with a slight increase in taxes.

But even in the current economic context it is likely that many workers would be willing to face a 0.2 percentage point increase in the payroll tax in order to keep the disability insurance program intact.  

After all, they would be paying these taxes to ensure their own protection from disability. 

Also, unlike our representatives in Congress, most workers probably do not think it is funny to threaten terminal cancer patients with a 20 percent cut in benefits.

For all the fear mongering rhetoric I've seen about Obama becoming King, Jeb Bush becoming president would put the US the closest it has ever been to a monarchy. 
And he wants to pay for this how??


I'm all for NASA, I just think it's really disingenuous to speak about increasing budgets without simultaneously having the honesty to say you want to raise taxes to pay for it. Or you want to borrow the money, if you want to be less fiscally responsible about it.


Either way, you gotta say how you are going to fund things or you are just making noise.

Of course a guy who wants the Republican nomination doesn't want the previous winner to join the race.

The very aggressive interventionist/militarist foreign policy supported heavily by both Democrats and Republicans since WWII is far too entrenched at this point.  Rand Paul is unquestionably the candidate that can draw the most votes away from the Democrats, but I fear he has no legitimate chance of winning because the entire country's power structure will oppose him to no ends.

If the Republicans had a candidate that like Paul opposed the drug war and mass incarcerations, but had a more "traditional" approach to foreign policy like Bush, Obama, Romney, and Hillary, then the GOP might have a real threat to the Democratic hold on the White House.

Just letting you know, the OP is a straight up antisemite.

&gt;That means I think recent global warming is real, mostly man-made and will continue

Compare that to the common Republican claim that AGW is a hoax. 
[deleted]
&gt; The claim that it's a hoax mostly revolves around environmental regulation and policy.

That's just silly. It may well *stem* from the ideological rejection of a proposed remedy. But the claim is frequently that warming does not actually exist. 

&gt;Regulations that move externalities into the cost of doing business is what they want to avoid

And so what? So they deny the facts? Is that just public denial or do you think they lie to themselves as well?

&gt;If one can convince others that AGW isn't happening, they have more leverage to dismiss the claims of environmental regulators that something needs to be done about cleaning up dirty industries or making said industries pay for the costs of environmental damage.

So you think that Inhofe is not that disconnected from reality, he just engages in deep dishonesty for political gain.

It's the same old rhetoric about strong foreign policy. It reminds me of the third Presidential debate in 2012 that covered foreign policy where Romney and Obama basically regurgitated the same narrative.

Candidate #1: *We need a strong presence in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect American interests!*

Candidate #2: *Great idea, but I must disagree! We need a strong presence in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect American interests!*

Candidate #1: *No, you're wrong! You see, we need a strong presence in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect American interests!*

\**barf*\*
I hope he signed up for Obama care 
&gt; Why is CNN running a glowing endorsement of Jeb Bush?

Bush is Hillary lite and not far off CNN's agenda

maybe CNN thinks he'll win the primaries and that's not so bad...so climb aboard early to help push the liberal side of Bush ...to make Bush think that's the winning campaign posture, which, would help Hillary too
To be fair McCain and Romney both ran to the center and lost. I'm sure the Democrats/CNN are interested in another losing centrist Republican. 

It just seems like the X factor is the bush hate because if ther really wanted a soft Republican they would put in for Christie. 

It seems like the Republicans election to lose. Jeb Bush or Christie seem like a good way to lose it. 
&gt; Jeb Bush or Christie

I can't imagined either winning Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina
We might have said the same of McCain or Romney.
The answer here is that Republicans dislike more taxes, which free education would lead to so that the country doesn't run even more of a deficit. Also, though education is generally good for the economy, there will still be plenty of jobs which don't require education and still must be done, so if everyone went to college they would probably end up wasting their time and taxpayer dollars. Also, tons of students go to college mainly to party anyways, so those people who do that AND have their education paid for by taxes are, once again, wasting taxpayer dollars.

In addition, community college already is quite cheap comparatively, and if a poor student proves that he is smart and involved, he could quite realistically go to college for free. 
Exactly. Breaks for the poor and involved in their education already exist and make a huge difference in paying for college. People can get money from the Pell Grant for school, and get great grades while starting a club, for example. These kinds of students go on to a University where their hard work pays off, and ultimately graduate with a degree in something marketable that they actually care about. 
&gt;In addition, community college already is quite cheap comparatively, and if a poor student proves that he is smart and involved, he could quite realistically go to college for free.

Hell I graduated HS with a 2.6/4.0 and I could have gone to community college for free with money left over from scholarships. However I chose not to. (and yes I pulled my GPA up- it's a 3.7 now.)
I'd like to point out that a lot of republicans and democrats actually have a common interest, helping the working class. It's just that we have a different way of doing things. Democrats usually like supporting the working class through social welfare programs, while republicans want to do it through privatized business. From a republican's point of view, if we support privatized business, then the economy will start to get better and start booming because there is more money flow within the country, more people are hiring, so more people are putting more money into the economy.

AND NOW TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

If the United States payed for the first four years of college for every American, then taxes would be raised and we'd probably get into more debt. We can all agree that that's pretty bad, because the people that are hurt the most are the working class. 

If instead, we did things like give more money to NASA (every dollar we put into NASA puts 7 into the US economy because they work with privatized business) and gave tax breaks to American industry and energy, then more people would have jobs (skilled laborer jobs, which can make $30-70k), then more people would be able to work their way through college, or maybe even learn a trade through community college.

----

For example, let's say there's a kid who grew up very economically disadvantaged but really worked hard and really wanted to be an electrical engineer. 

He could go to cc to get an associates in ee so he can get calculus and such, then become a certified electrician. Keep in mind, there's a LOT of demand for higher level electricians that took calculus (you can make 30k off the bat, then make 40-50k after a while of work experience) 

He could then finish his degree at a 4 year university and get a lot more money. He'd probably finish his degree at 24-25, which is later than a lot of other people, but his work experience would definitely help him. 

In the long run, he'd probably end up a lot better off, because the economy would be booming and he would probably be able to have a 401k and such.
Full length? Meaning how long? And it was at 5:30AM, not exactly prime time. And what makes you think it was special for Iowa, I don't think that CNN has state editions.


&gt;Jeb Bush or Christie seem like a good way to lose it. 

Who do you think has the best chances?
It ran for thirty minutes. It was a full feature. Also, I don't know if it was for Iowa that was just additional detail. 
It's not actually free.  
You implied they were showing it just in Iowa, not just nationally. And are they doing similar things for other potential candidates? They sure have been giving both Rand and Ted of coverage. 

(It is odd, this is going to be a first name campaign. You can't say Paul and Bush because we won't know which Paul and Bush. But then we can't use some first and some last names.)

Somebody newer and more appealing to the Republican base. I don't have a favorite in the current field and frankly I'd prefer this person be a late announcement. Long candidacies seem to give the Democrat machine more time to beat a person down.

If I had to pick someone who's name has come up it would be Carson or Jindal. These two mostly because of their credibility on healthcare.carson is vulnerable because he's not really a political figure and Jindal can be tied to the bush administration. I don't like Carson for the job but I think he could win the election. 

I think it is too early to pick a star right now. Granted I will say I would vote for Bush. Christie on the other hand, yeah I'll hold my nose and vote Hillary(and I've never voted democrat in my life). Basically, the only hope that corrupt, Jersey meatball has of getting my vote is Elizabeth Warren.

I'm hoping for a promising late entry even if it is like hoping for snow in July. 

I does seem like there is a plurality of candidates to split the votes of the core elements of the base. I'm not sure a candidate that can win the primary can win the presidential election. I will say there have been enough primaries turned over to closed primaries that this might not be an issue this time. 

Jindal has a lot going for him. There is some novelty with race and ethnicity. He has that whole "genius" background similar to what they fabricated for Obama. Governor. Healthcare background. Southern. Roman-catholic(shifting demographics). He might not be the best man for the job but he might be the best man for the election. (I wonder who they would use to balance that ticket. Probably a hawk. Maybe that cotton fellow)

TL:DR a lot of words for Jindal. 
I didn't mean to imply that. Communication error on my part.

That is weird, the bit on first names. Jeb and Rand... Rand is an interesting character. I feel like he bears some corruption of blood thanks to his father's ramblings similar to Jeb's problems with the Bushlers proceeding him.(I'm actually quite fond of early Dubya and voted for him both times with pleasure).

Rand is interesting for me because he might be able to get the Ron Paul Revolution crowd to carry water with the rest of the party. That might have long term ramifications. Anything other than disruption from them would be great. 

I wonder what angle they are playing with Rand. Theories?

According to Bloomberg, the authority on all things GOP. 
Embarrassing! What has happened to the GOP?
MSNBC doesn't produce news, everything they put out is just pure garbage. The Social Security system is in need of a fix, not just another bailout. The system is not self substaining and more and more Americans are scamming into drawing early on disability. Our whole system needs a major reboot and overhaul.
[deleted]
How do you feel about universal basic income?

This point could be debatable, but one of the main talking points is that it could replace every social welfare program we have, with more benefits, less oversight, less bureaucracy, and end up costing less. Everyone would get it.
&gt;nor any other college

&gt;&gt;Paul went on to graduate from Duke's medical school in 1988
I would have to see more information on that before I could render an opinion. Typically I am opposed to any system that would reward someone for not contributing to society or to the system in general. I was born and have lived in central  Florida my whole life and I see the leeches everyday. Breeders is what I call them because they keep having babies to get more or extend out their taxpayer funded benefits. I also see many people that receive disability that keep brand new trucks and $80,000 bass boats and spend all of their time sucking up taxpayer dollars while they didn't even put in 15 good years of work anywhere. I know I'm ranting, and possibly incoherent, but it just kills me to work two jobs, my wife working a full time job, paying our own bills, stressing over the unexpected expenses that come with having kids and living life, while people stand around, unashamed with their hands out screaming that the handouts they are given isn't enough and want more. I have more respect for the semi-homeless crack heads and drunks that hold signs up on the corner begging for money.  Sorry for the rant...
could it be that Hillary is leading because no other dogs are racing?
That was a fluff piece if I've ever seen one...  basically one paragraph about Cuba, the rest about his evolving staff decisions and foreign policy philosophy which isn't yet fully defined.  

I've heard the trope about sanctions needing more time...  40 years is quite enough; it's time for a change.  Not a Castro/Obama apologist, but the whole idea of normalizing relations with a country is to continue to influence them with interactions and relationships at various levels.  That's the exact justification GWB used when he continued the US government policy of MFN trading status with China.

Jeb is going to have to figure out how to run on something other than "I'm not my brother" if he wants to have a chance...  He could point out GWB's successes and promise to pick those back up...  
I think what it gets down to is that Giuliani and Obama have different understandings of America and what it stands for.  I think President Obama has been largely influenced by the dominant perspective of the age, that America (and democracy) *means* diversity.  Those Americans that first built America recognized the diversity of influence from many different European nations who had been in conflict as they colonized and settled the new World.  They came together to debate and document the points that would best serve to meet the needs of every citizen...and they developed our Constitution.  The Constitution provided a central forum for unity.  So they focused on the *unity* of diverse viewpoints around a central purpose, rather than on the diversity itself.

Deconstructionalists view the Constitution as something to *use* to fit one's own viewpoint rather than attempting to interpret *what was meant by it's authors.* Their mantra seems to be that the Constitution may be interpreted in many *diverse* ways.  Constitionalists, on the contrary, hold that we are attempting *to find unity* by interpreting the law as those who wrote the Constitution intended.  Times change, but the principles delineated in our Constitution (and Bill of Rights) are constructed around the universal needs of citizens.

Democracy is always diverse; but it only works when the diversity is unified by a common cause that protects every member.  Those  laws that unite around that desire to protect work to unify the nation.  

So I believe that President Obama loves America for it's diversity and the opportunity it offers for all; but Giuliani is looking for a love that unites around protecting every citizen--even those who oppose President Obama's vision.  When we spread the power out by recognizing that the President's role is not to do what he wants, but to act as a servant of the American people, we are loving America for her core characteristic which are found in our core documents,  that Constitution and Bill of Rights which was written *protectively* so that we could keep our Democratic Republic intact.

"PPP surveyed 316 Republican primary voters from February 20th to 22nd. The margin of error for
the survey is +/- 5.5%. This survey was conducted through automated telephone interviews and
interviews over the internet to voters who don’t have landline phones."

Yea.... A whopping 180 people respond this way out of a likely carefully selected (considering the sample methods) survey sample of a mere 316 and we get people posting titles like you.

Let's add this too: PPP, a Democratic-leaning firm, surveyed 316 Republican primary voters from February 20-22. The margin of error was 5.5 percentage points. The survey also asked questions about potential primary candidates and the favorability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
we already have a national religion...**Obama**
Good God is this title (of the article) misleading. Complete straw grabbing if I've ever seen it. Also I want to see what the question is IN THE ARTICLE. Very convenient they don't state it as written in the survey. In the published survey, it basically reads as "if it was on the docket that Christianity was going to be voted on to be the national religion would you support it?" and not "Should Christianity be the national religion, laws aside?" as the article would like others to believe. The first question would be met with a shoulder shrug and a "yeah, sure" the 2nd would be met with "uh, no" by many if not all of the people who answered yes to the first question. Very very different framing. 
That's certainly not been my experience in the Republican Party.
so... your the other half

Take it from a liberal who for many years thought everyone agreed what an idiot and how bad a president GWB was in his 1st term and then watched him get re-elected. I saw a liar, a dope, a malevolent evil man; others saw a bold leader, a relatable  everyman, a man unafraid to make hard decisions. 

These scandals you see are all in your head. It's wishful thinking not based in reality. You sound like an idiot to most of the world just as I sounded like an idiot in 2002 when I went around saying Bush let 9/11 happen on purpose. If you keep on this path you will soon find yourself on a street corner passing out LaRouche literature. In other words you will be one more insignificant, crazy conspiracy theorist who is not making one iota of difference in the world to anyone but themselves. 

Life is too short man. Just let go and try and enjoy what's left of your life. Giving up being overly concerned about politics and things I can't change was the best decision I ever made in my life.

When it comes to Israel, are we to understand that the more people they kill the more healthy the world is? Is the holy land holy because they never stop engaging in warfare? Is that what makes Israel holy? They never end their war?
Those are big worries though that are probably built up and comprised of lots of little worries.

Well said, its better off to debate the issues where you disagree not that the other side is evil rhetoric, it makes you look uneducated and irrational.
We definitely aren't at war with Islam. A select amount of Islamic extremist are at war with us. 
It is of my understanding that when a caliphate is declared it is beholden upon ALL Muslims to follow the instructions given by the caliph. Whereas "most" would not recognize this authority, as you have postulated, in this age there is the internet and there undoubtedly are far more "obedient" Muslims who will follow through with given instructions. Having said that, it would behoove us individually to take stock of the ones around us at work, at school and where we leisure and the parameters for being weary of others now includes and tops the list with... Having outward Islamic appearance or beliefs.  This distrust has been seeded and bred by main stream media.
Ok, I'll bite. First of all, it's still not proven hat she didn't break the law, because there are numerous other laws dealing with the handling of classified information she may have broken. Furthermore, her actions were taken immediately following a scandal in the bush administration for doing the exact same thing. Skewering the bush admin. and turning around and doing the same thing smacks of hypocrisy. Thirdly, it was against the regulations and guidelines of the regulatory agency that oversees these archives from he beginning. Finally, that amendment you so gleefully cite allows the use of private email WHEN NECESSARY. It was only meant to provide for specific circumstances, and assumed the existence of a government account that would then recieve an copy of the communications for archival. 
&gt;  it would behoove us individually to take stock of the ones around us at work, at school and where we leisure

No, not really. It is not the averages citizens job to play detective with other people's lives. Now obviously if you notice something overtly concerning you should contact the proper authorities but beyond that we shouldn't be going around "taking stock" of those around us. 

Not a huge fan of legalization but if it's what the country wants then so be it, I personally will always vote no but it's not an issue I am going to get all worked up over. 
What agency rules do you refer to that required her to keep e mails for archiving purposes?
It would appear that op is factually correct. She did not violate THIS law since it did not exist during her tenure. That doesn't mean she didn't violate a different law or rule. It also seems foolish and non transparent. In part that's the point of the law: to help promote transparency. 

In the end she might not have broken the law. But she certainly illustrates why this law was needed. Maybe she did nothing shady (like Scott walker) but we'll never know. You can't disprove a negatve. Considering the zombie like resilience if the Benghazi and irs issues, the last thing anyone needs is this. It's just stupid. I'll isten to her explanation. I don't expect my opinion to change. 
Did law require her to retain certain information?

Did she?

Has she been 100% open about retaining and releasing that information?

Then I'll have a problem with that.
Why not? We have both, Israel has both, France has both, Briton has both, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, have both.
Iran is run by crazy people. That's why.

I don't understand how she attacked interracial marriage and assimilation..? It's not clear in the article
You missed the key point: " has always placed Judaism at the forefront of her politics". This is an attack on her for being Jewish. That site is full of white pride and attacks on "black power" and point out that there are Jews around.



If any Republican described any type of "intermarriage" as a "problem," especially in the context of it being something that threatens her identity and traditions, there would be a major media shit storm.  This one has a D after her name, though, so it's perfectly OK.
Her problem is that Jews intermarry way to much. She's not saying, 'Jews should only marry Jews' she's saying 'Jews, marry other people!' 

I think if a Republican thought Christian intermarriage was becoming a problem and said, 'Christians, marry non-Christians!' there wouldn't be any attack from anyone. In fact I bet they'd be applauded.
Wow, you cranked up the spin machine to 11.
Thats why this bitch needs to go. It does not matter if your a D or an R , you go! The media needs to hear about this one
Ugh she looks like an oily ferret

That's what I'm saying. Why is this relevant?
It is interesting to hear the same debate on Iran from several years back. It seemed that Iran was months away from having the bomb. Now the debate with Iran continues - but what really has changed? That is the question - is this still relevant ?
All of the people he quoted as saying there was no evidence of Iranian WMDs back then are now saying there is evidence of weapons construction...
And with this he has cemented his status as a crackpot enemy of the conservative movement.

FTA:

&gt; It's senior year in high school, just before homecoming, and the kids at the rival school in Houston have managed to steal the school flag from Cruz's Second Baptist School. Cruz, the valedictorian, calls three buddies and says it's time to exact revenge. They buy 36 rolls of toilet paper, three cans of shaving cream, toothpaste and shampoo. That night, they paper the gym at Northwest Academy, leaving behind a Hallmark card inscribed, in lipstick, with the message, "It's not nice to steal."
&gt; 
&gt; The janitors at Northwest spy Cruz and his gang and give chase. With Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" blaring on the cassette deck - the guys knew it as the attack theme from "Apocalypse Now" - Cruz drives the getaway vehicle, "the Green Bomb," his 1978 Ford Fairmont. Alas, the men from Northwest take down Cruz's license plate number. The next day, he is called to see the principal.
&gt; 
&gt; Cruz fesses up - yes, it was his car, his TP job. But asked to name his accomplices, Cruz calmly replies, "I'm not going to tell you."

&gt;"I figured you'd say that," the principal says. He pulls from his desk drawer a letter he has written and signed, asking the admission office at Princeton - which has already accepted Cruz - to rescind their offer.

&gt;Cruz will not budge. "I consider it a matter of character and integrity not to rat on my friends," he says.

&gt;Whereupon the principal calls Cruz's father, who tells his son, "Ted, just get out of high school." The son explains his devotion to the no-snitching principle, and Rafael Cruz accepts the argument. "You're right, and I'm proud of you," his dad tells him.

&gt;As it turned out, the principal had already identified the other culprits. The letter to Princeton was never sent. Cruz had stood tall - and won.

I like that. Did a better job than most high school hell raisers, and he handled it really well too.

I wish I had the time to put these in order:

1. get rid of all but a handful of [government agencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_agencies_in_the_United_States)
2. abolish the IRS then institute the flat tax (13%), business and personal
3. stop support of all education from the federal level
4. cabinet would be reduced to Sec Defense, Sec Treasury, Sec State and Attorney General
5. sell off the USPS
6. mandate an annual reduction of national debt by at least 2%
7. do "something" about banking that forces banks to lend again
8. put the clamps on The Fed.  no more crap like QE-forever
9. outsource all possible federal work to private industry
10. secure all borders
11. eliminate almost all federal funding of "studies"
12. as for health care, I need 2,000 pages, but included are a) all insurance payments go to the individual (not hospital, doctor, etc), b) services, drugs, procedures are all allowed but only after prices are physically posted as well as on the Internet, c) FDA is reduced to an advisory role with no direct authority to say yes-no on what citizens and their providers wish to do

I'm tired now

Kick ass. Go to space. Represent the human race.
As a liberal, I can agree with most of this.  I too would repeal Obamacare, and replace it with single payer as it would be cheaper and be "more conservative" of our resources to do so.  #6 is where we diverge starkly.  IMHO the state has no say about what a woman can or cannot do with her body, just as the state has no say on what I should be able to ingest.  Looks like we have common enough ground to have a debate, and in the process compromise.
FTA:

&gt;The most important sentence in his speech was this one: "Today, roughly half of born-again Christians aren't voting," Cruz said. "They're staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values."

I agree. That is the most important one. I've actually been saying for a while that the GOP should be getting out more Evangelical voters. Not just that, they should work to get religious Hispanics and blacks on board with the GOP as well. The Democrats have gone pretty far with the social issues between 9 months of legal abortion in their platform and forced acceptance of gay marriage in a short amount of time. There is going to be an opposite, if not equal, reaction to all of this. It's up to the Republicans to capitalize on it. 
Ted Cruz is substantially more right-wing than almost every other serious Republican candidate in the last 30 years by many metrics. See [here](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lets-be-serious-about-ted-cruz-from-the-start-hes-too-extreme-and-too-disliked-to-win/). He's not even going to get the party nomination. And if anyone here seriously disagrees, I'd be willing to bet $25 that he doesn't get it. I'd also be willing to bet even more money that he doesn't win the final election. 
I don't think he's the most likely person to win the GOP nomination. Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio are more likley to win it than Cruz. I wouldn't be surprised if Cruz won it, either. The general election would be a much harder task for Cruz. He can do the nomination. This guy's much better than Santorum or Huckabee were. This is a brilliant, eloquent guy. One might say that Cruz is the "Mitt Romney of teabaggers". 
Between the "talk show" conservatives and the religious right he really will be a much bigger force than people seem to expect him to be. If he does well enough to outlast Rand Paul he'll even take a big chunk of the Libertarian vote. 

Look for this to come down to Cruz vs Bush or Cruz vs Walker, or perhaps Cruz vs Rubio. He will be stronger than Santorum and Huckabee were as "insurgent" candidates. Will it be enough? Big money, the establishment, and moderate voters will be against him. 
100% she wont win
here in Florida, I can not find a single Republican who wants Bush...zero

Bloomberg is an agenda media hoping the Jebster wins the primaries to be slaughtered by prepared media armed to kill another Bush
No one is restricting religious rights of Christians. *Everyone* who engages in commerce follows the same exact rules; which is that if you want a business license to sell good or services, you have to offer your service to *everyone*. No one gets to selectively decide who they will and who they won't serve. You can't open a cookie store and say you will sell to everyone except people with red hair. 
He makes it sound like only Christians should have the right to discriminate and to deny them that ability is persecution. 

Should I be allowed to open a restaurant that refuses to service Christians? NO, because that in fact would be discrimination.

I can't believe this has to be explained to anyone. The logic of Mike Pence fails on a third grade and above level. 
You do not understand the law. You will not be able to just simply deny any service for any reason, you won't be able to hang up "no gays allowed" signs. See [this](http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/indianas-religious-freedom-restoration-act-explained_900641.html) for an explanation.

It's OK to refuse service to Christians when they ask you to do something that is against your core beliefs. See [this](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416155/baking-liberty-conscience-cake-quin-hillyer) example from Ireland. 

My home state of Connecticut also has one of these laws. Ours is actually more strict than Indiana's is. The controversy over the Indiana version of the law stems from a mixture of ignorance, dishonesty, and intolerance. The law itself is rather uncontroversial. We should be celebrating these religious freedom laws as an example of how progressive the United States, to be honest. 
&gt;I personally will always vote no

Cruz can't even become president! Why is this not being brought to attention?
It is true that the best leaders can bring people together.  This doesn't happen by trying wrest away the their concerns, it happens by alleviating those concerns through communicating clear objectives that address all or most of them.  And in a friendly 'reaganesque'' way.  

I'm keeping my eye on these candidates, I like what Jeb Bush is doing, but on one important foreign policy issue I am concerned about the counsel he is opening himself to.  
Fuck this bullshit. Jeb accomplished nothing and is the picture of what is wrong withethe GOP estalbishment. Also hes too goddamn left on several issues.
Jeb is a very accomplished person. See his record as governor. He's also fully on the right on some of the most important issues. 
Bull. He cheerleads common core, medicaid expansion, and is shitty on immigration.

Also, 
http://www.ibtimes.com/jeb-bush-pressed-pension-officials-behalf-donors-firm-1865946







And he's pro-life, in favor of the RFRA bill, in favor of traditional marriage. Something needs to be done about immigration. Common core is OK, it can be used as a precursor to school choice. 

Jeb Bush really is probably the strongest candidate the GOP has this time around. I would much rather have Romney in the White House, but oh well. 


The best I can give you is a Cabinet Position with Walker/Paul's administration. 
Rand Paul is a non-starter. Now if you mean "Paul Ryan" as the VP that would be OK. 
&gt;In the contest for the Republican nomination, Bush tops the field with 20 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents saying they would support him if their primary or caucus were held today. He is followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 13 percent and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 12 percent. 
WHAT YEAR IS IT???


yea yea yea but we're MILES away from the combat months
Laying aside the standby regarding first impressions being most important Cruz' strategy could actually be a masterful stroke.  By appealing to Evangelicals first, he can persuade them that he prioritizes the social issues that largely determine their final votes.  By doing it at the beginning, he could also be allowing for the ripple effect to work for him; he may not need to actually focus on the group much (just a few bones), while addressing the needs of the other clusters in the center, the Evangelicals may already be firmly in his camp.  The word 'Moderate' sends a mixed message: to some it means a candidate doesn't have firm beliefs and a strong platform.  I prefer the term fair-minded which relates to balance rather than lack of fervency.  
I agree with you here. George Will is traditional and rational, voters are not always rational. In a rational world Mitt Romney would have won the election in 2012. That's the issue here. 

Cruz's strategy is pretty clear. Time will tell if it works. 
Just a little curious about eliminating funding of studies. Wouldn't that hamper technological development and innovation?
[deleted]
Re-watching the 2012 debates between Romney and Obama upsets me because Romney won each debate on every point, but I guess the public just doesn't watch the debates. 

Besides that, here's the thing about Evangelicals, if the Reps elect someone less religious then Cruz the Evangelicals will still vote for them because they could never take a Dem. president who goes against their views.
I would get the best people around me regardless of their bias and solve problems with them. 
The one main issue I definitely want to help would be the education system and give subsidies for in demand majors that the U.S could benefit from. 
I think Bush has some momentum right now in the polls is because of name recognition. If you watch the Reps. speak at CPAC the audience always boos Bush mainly because he is WAY to radical on immigration, and I don't think the party or the country even wants another Bush. 
&gt; hamper technological development and innovation

if that needs doing, it will be done by private interests ...as they were **always done before** government started passing out "grants" to endless stream of [nonsensical projects/studies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeleef/2014/10/22/most-government-sponsored-research-is-simply-wasteful-but-truthy-is-menacing-to-boot/)

&gt; I intend to work with my colleagues to continue to ensure that any final agreement, if reached, is reviewed by Congress and that additional sanctions continue to be imposed on Iran until it completely gives up its nuclear ambitions and the regime changes its destructive behavior.

&gt; Our message to Iran should be clear: until the regime chooses a different path, the United States will continue to isolate Iran and impose pressure.

I can understand where she is coming from with some of her points but she needs to tread very carefully on this one. It's a firebomb, we've all seen it already. You have everyone from other Republican governors to business leaders making never seen before statements condemning this and distancing themselves from Indiana and Governor Pence.

If she makes just one mis-step on this one it could really work against her in a 2016 Presidential race.
But, the law supports religion which is key to our constitution and the discrimination is pointless because if someone discriminates they will loose business. I like to believe that as a society there will be WAY more businesses that will serve discriminated people then those that won't. 

I don't disagree with Schwarzenegger that the bill is harming the Republicans, but the left is spinning pretty hard. 
Carly just wants some publicity. 

Mike Pence didnt exactly sign that bill for Indiana's sake. He was an unknown guy until the bill passed - now he will run in the presidential race and then become a VP.

Carly is not just unknown - but she is damaged goods. She isn't looking at the presidential race at all, but the California senate race. Get publicity from railing against Tim cook and being positive on RFRA  and at least the republicans in California may support her. 

2016 presidential race ? LOL. Carly has less chance of becoming a president or VP than Arnold!
Bush, Walker, Rubio, and Cruz. This is the same four that model redditor jcm267 singled out! 
And if no one gets enough delegate votes to put them over the top on the first ballot, then a Draft Romney movement might come into play.

Romney may not be the first choice of many, but he does seem to be the second choice of many.
Romney's far and away my first choice. My second choice leans to Jeb, but I also sort of like Cruz. I think he's more "crazy like a fox". That guy's a unique talent. His lack of executive experience hurts him with me, I'm not as concerned about his attitude as others are. 
Not going to happen. Even by the standards of many of the Republicans who vote in primaries, Cruz is right-wing.  [By actual metrics he's substantially more right-wing than pretty much every major Republican candidate in the last 20 years](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lets-be-serious-about-ted-cruz-from-the-start-hes-too-extreme-and-too-disliked-to-win/). I'd be willing to bet $25 with anyone who wants that he isn't going to win the GOP primary. 

(I got banned from /r/TedCruz for saying this earlier.) 
[deleted]
I see you post to /r/collapse, which a place where Rand Paul's base hangs out. 

I wouldn't bet on Cruz winning the primary, but I wouldn't bet against it either. Jeb is the front runner. I put Cruz in the 2nd tier alongside Rubio and Walker. 

I would be willing to take a slightly different bet. I see Cruz as a virtual lock for South Carolina. Cruz seems like a natural fit for the Iowa GOP electorate, but that is also a caucus state and one where Ron Paul's people have their best ground game. New Hampshire is probably where Jeb, Walker, or Rubio would make a splash and get a win. Nevada is a possible Rand state but I give Jeb/Rubio the edge out there. 

So... If Cruz 2 or more out of the first 4 primaries, I win. If Cruz wins 0 of the first 4 primaries, I lose. If Cruz wins 1 out of the first 4 primaries it's a draw. If I lose and Rand wins 2 or less of the first 4 primaries I will donate $50 to Rand Paul's campaign, or to a different GOP candidate of your choice. If Rand manages to win 3 out of the first 4 caucus/primaries I would agree to give Rand $250. If Rand wins all four of the first primaries I'll give Rand $500. If I win, you have to give $100 to the GOP candidate of my choice from among the "top four" as National Interest recently named them (Bush, Cruz, Rubio, Walker). Would you accept this deal? 
&gt; I wouldn't bet on Cruz winning the primary, but I wouldn't bet against it either. Jeb is the front runner. I put Cruz in the 2nd tier alongside Rubio and Walker.

I've give a substantially lower probability than both Rubio and Walker, who are both much more moderate in terms of voting records and haven't ticked off most of the establishment.

&gt; If Cruz 2 or more out of the first 4 primaries, I win. If Cruz wins 0 of the first 4 primaries, I lose. If Cruz wins 1 out of the first 4 primaries it's a draw. If I lose and Rand wins 2 or less of the first 4 primaries I will donate $50 to Rand Paul's campaign, or to a different GOP candidate of your choice. If Rand manages to win 3 out of the first 4 caucus/primaries I would agree to give Rand $250. If Rand wins all four of the first primaries I'll give Rand $500. If I win, you have to give $100 to the GOP candidate of my choice from among the "top four" as National Interest recently named them (Bush, Cruz, Rubio, Walker). Would you accept this deal?

Not really. You may be under the misapprehension that I'm a Rand Paul fan. That's pretty far from accurate. I do spend time in /r/collapse, but that's incidental (in fact until you made your comment I didn't even know that was a location where Paul fans were common although I suppose it does make sense). 

But if something were done in a similar fashion with an actually apolitical set of charities, like say Against Malaria, or Doctors without Borders, I'd be more ok with considering that sort of thing. The primary reason I wouldn't do so is that I don't think Cruz winning 2 out of the first four primaries is at all unlikely. But it is very common for a candidate to have a strong showing in the first few primaries and then peter out. I'd actually if anything expect something like that to be not unlikely since Cruz has actively declared whereas most of the other major candidates haven't declared. 
Jeb Bush gets this nomination.
[deleted]
I assign a high probability to that also, close to 50%.

Rand Is The Brand In 2016
Not really. 
i would rather him then all the others who want to run. bottom line is hell will freeze over before hilary clinton is my president
If Rand gets the nomination I might even donate to Hillary's campaign. I would happily vote for pretty much any GOP candidate, but not Rand. 
Well I suppose you can like whoever you want, but you would have to be high on bath salts to want hillary in the white house.
If the choice is between Hillary and a member of the Paul family, I'll take Hillary. She is the least bad choice in that scenario. 

Nominate Bush, Rubio, Walker, Cruz, Pence, Graham, Jindal, Perry, pretty much whoever and I'll vote GOP. But no to Rand Paul. 
Looks like the Paultards have a big mountain to climb if they want to "beat" Cruz in the money game. 

FTA:

&gt;The Texas senator's supporters throw down a marker in the fundraising sweepstakes—$31 million raised in less than a week. 
So he flipped to FP sanity...   Good.     Iran and totalitarian islam is a threat and I'm glad he's saying so now.  
At his core he's a nut, though. Sort of like his dad. Rand's a big risk. 

If you want a "solid conservative" Cruz is your guy, maybe Walker. Rubio and Bush are good for moderates. Just say no to Rand! 
[deleted]
No. Rand is great. And hes doesn't take shit from anyone. Bush is a moderate democrat wannabe, Rubio is too inexperienced (for now) and Cruz is just annoying. Walker is awesome though. 
Rand is the worst. He is a slimeball whose core values are rooted in the conspiracy-oriented nonsense his dad was involved in. Cruz is smarter, more eloquent, and more proven than Paul. If you want a "true conservative" Cruz is your man. If you want someone more moderate Cruz obviously not for you. 

Rand is the most Alex Jones-friendly candidate. 
[deleted]
I'm not gonna downvote you like everyone else, but as a guy from the outside looking in, Cruz does not come across as more elequent imo.  Ron Paul at least doesn't let the news media walk all over him, which is nice how he was like "You editorialized that statement, now let me respond."  I just don't think Cruz one, looks very Presidential, but two, I don't think he can win in the National polls.

I think Americans want conservatism, but I think the vast majority of Americans don't want Evangelical conservatism, which sadly has encapsulated much of the conservative movement.  I think Rand Paul is at least a conservative, but not an Evangelical conservative.

Nothing wrong with people's religion, but I hate how people still will say in arguments, "Well the Bible says this.. and that's why we shouldn't allow that in the US."  Well whoop dee doo!  What does the constitution say?  Bible says you shouldn't be living with your girlfriend before your married either, I don't think the US gov't should be making laws saying people can't do that.  This is why I like Rand Paul as he has distanced himself from that side of the conservative movement.
&gt;Cruz does not come across as more elequent imo. 

Cruz is a national debating champion. Rand Paul can't even handle tough questions from Samantha Guthrie on *The Today Show*. 

&gt;I think Americans want conservatism, but I think the vast majority of Americans don't want Evangelical conservatism, 

Bush won in 2000 as an Evangelical moderate. Cruz can definitely at least win the nomination. 

&gt;I think Rand Paul is at least a conservative, but not an Evangelical conservative.

Rand Paul is a certifiable lunatic. 

&gt;Nothing wrong with people's religion, but I hate how people still will say in arguments, "Well the Bible says this.. and that's why we shouldn't allow that in the US."

Lots of our laws are rooted in religious tradition. Most people don't argue that we should make things illegal solely because of what the bible says. 


Bottom line is Rand Paul is a lunatic. A huge number of sensible conservatives will either be sitting home or voting for the Democrat if he  were to win the nomination. It's no coincidence that the outcry against Paul's announcement has been **much** stronger on both sides of the aisle.  They don't like Cruz's attitude and many find him to be too far to the right wing, but they all know Rand Paul is nuts. 

Not a good start to a campaign.

While "New American Century" has appeal, he's going to have to emphasize how he defines 'American' after the deconstructionists of the last (?will be?) 8 years are through 'changing' the American image.  Especially with the 'new' in front of it, though it's supposed to modify century...we know how popular thought goes...

edit:  was going to give many more thoughts on developing slogans, but decided not to just now.



Lol this fuckin guy
Goddamnit. THIS is why that middle 5-7% won't be swayed to vote right. The only way I've been able to even carry on a dialogue with ANY productivity with anyone on the left is by acknowledging that gay marriage and at a minimum marijuana need to be legalized. Socially, we must come left if we want to have any chance at retaking the White House. Once we're there, we can work on the behind the scenes, less glamorous fiscal issues and keep the left satiated with their social issues. I'm fine with both of these things being legal anyways, but even if I weren't, let the baby (the left) have their bottle. Being hard hearted on those two issues alone has cost us elections in the past and will cost us elections in the future if we don't open up on them.
Voters are cracking down on Drug War pushing politicians.
in poker terms, Marco is all in.  he loses his opportunity to re-run for Florida Senate with his move towards the White House.  he's committed
I'm concerned of his foreign policy. 
He has a low chance of winning the nomination. I'd be willing to bet if anyone here wants that he doesn't win.

Socially, we must push the country to the right if the country is to survive. Secular leftism is cultural suicide. Not only that, but if you drop social issues you are giving up any chance of winning the White House or holding majorities in either chamber of Congress for at least a generation. 
**Your vote could be the deciding factor on changing the [current outcome](https://imgur.com/a/z779e).**

Seems like a fair summary of what he's done. How likely do you think is it that he'll win? 
if he can boot Jebster quickly then have a long campaign run, against Hellary = sure thing
So if someone offered to make you a bet for say $25 on whether he'll win the Presidency, would you take it? 
if he's the candidate, yes.  right now, too many months to go
And how likely is it do you think that he'll win the primary? 
How likely is it do you think that Cruz will win the primary nomination? 
We've already discussed this. 
Sorry, you are correct: we did have this discussion. :) Not always easy to keep track of every other user here. 
How likely do you think is it that Rand Paul will win the primary nomination? How likely is it do you think that he'll win the Presidency? 
You're welcome
40%
55%

President Rand Paul
Vice President Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina or John Kasich. 


I'm a little confused by your probabilities since the first one is lower than the second, and I'd think that that would be the reverse. You seem to be assigning a higher probability to him winning the Presidency than winning the nomination? 
More competition for the nomination. Only two for the Presidency. 
Ah, so 55% is your estimate for his chance of winning the Presidency *given* that he's won the nomination? 
Yes.
Interesting. That doesn't seem that different from my estimates for the most part. 

If someone offered you a bet at 2-1 odds in your favor over whether Paul will be the Republican Presidential nomination with one of  Walker, Fiorina or Kasich as the running mate would you take it? 
No.

His immigration policy is hurting him bad with the republicans.

add in Common Core advocacy, taxes are NOT off his table, and specifically undermining conservatives

who? is this the token women bid for the GOP?
She's a very well known woman. Former CEO of HP. Her name has been floated as a potential VP pick. She recently ran for Senate in California but lost because it's not a pro-GOP state any more. 
Oh, so the story isn't that he actually bothered to show up?
This guys fake outrage and hyperbolic predilection makes him unbearable to me! 
after you see her speak/comment, you'll be excited.  she's strong
Strong or not she wont make it out of the GOP primaries. If anything she will be lucky to be the token woman vp pick. sarah palin 2.0 for the GOP. She's a token. 

[Interviews with close to a dozen current and former HP employees reveal that nearly 10 years after being forced out of the firm, Fiorina remains a deeply polarizing figure. Her tenure, which coincided with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, was fraught with layoffs, leadership transitions and a controversial merger with Compaq that pitted Fiorina against members of the Hewlett and Packard families in an ugly public feud. .](http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/22/politics/carly-fiorina-hp/)

he's bought and paid for by Sheldon Adelson. He will defend the country of Isreal. That is will be his foreign policy.
so he is promoting the drug war? talk about doing damage to the country and wasting money.
i agree, republicans need to move into the 21 century on social issues if they want to win a white house bid.
as they should be. Drug war is a huge waste of money, it hurts families, creates poverty among minorities, and ignores the revenues that could be created by legalizing MJ. 
End the war on drugs.
Decriminalize and legalize drugs.
It will remove money, guns and power from cartels, gangs, and political corruption.
It will greatly reduce gang violence and end drug war violence, which will save the lives of children and adults.
It will protect children since there will not be a monetary incentive for dealers to push drugs.
Less fathers will be in prison, therefore more fathers will be with their children and families.
More kids will attend school since there will not be the easy money from dealing drugs to lure them into leaving school.
It will remove money from the inner city gangs which will in turn, make it much harder for gang members to purchase guns.
It will free up money that was used on law enforcement to be used for drug education and treatment. Also freed up resources could be shifted to law enforcement in Murder, Rape, Pedophilia, Human Trafficking, Violent Assault, Burglary/Robbery/Theft, Reckless Driving, Border Security, Fraud, Government Corruption, Vandalism and Cyber Hacking.
It will remove the problem of drug smugglers crossing the border illegally and lessen the danger to border security and residents of border towns.
Court expenses will be reduced from the reduction in cases.
States expenses will be reduced because they will need fewer jails.
Nonsense.

* [The Leadership of Ronald Reagan](http://ashbrook.org/publications/onprin-v7n6-meese/)
Thank you!
A pretty awesome one. Look at all these great things he did! I hate minorities and women so was glad to see #5 and #9.

1. Reagan was a serial tax raiser. As governor of California, Reagan “signed into law the largest tax increase in the history of any state up till then.” Meanwhile, state spending nearly doubled. As president, Reagan “raised taxes in seven of his eight years in office,” including four times in just two years. As former GOP Senator Alan Simpson, who called Reagan “a dear friend,” told NPR, “Ronald Reagan raised taxes 11 times in his administration — I was there.” “Reagan was never afraid to raise taxes,” said historian Douglas Brinkley, who edited Reagan’s memoir. Reagan the anti-tax zealot is “false mythology,” Brinkley said.

2. Reagan nearly tripled the federal budget deficit. During the Reagan years, the debt increased to nearly $3 trillion, “roughly three times as much as the first 80 years of the century had done altogether.” Reagan enacted a major tax cut his first year in office and government revenue dropped off precipitously. Despite the conservative myth that tax cuts somehow increase revenue, the government went deeper into debt and Reagan had to raise taxes just a year after he enacted his tax cut. Despite ten more tax hikes on everything from gasoline to corporate income, Reagan was never able to get the deficit under control.

3. Unemployment soared after Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts. Unemployment jumped to 10.8 percent after Reagan enacted his much-touted tax cut, and it took years for the rate to get back down to its previous level. Meanwhile, income inequality exploded. Despite the myth that Reagan presided over an era of unmatched economic boom for all Americans, Reagan disproportionately taxed the poor and middle class, but the economic growth of the 1980’s did little help them. “Since 1980, median household income has risen only 30 percent, adjusted for inflation, while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled,” the New York Times’ David Leonhardt noted.

4. Reagan grew the size of the federal government tremendously. Reagan promised “to move boldly, decisively, and quickly to control the runaway growth of federal spending,” but federal spending “ballooned” under Reagan. He bailed out Social Security in 1983 after attempting to privatize it, and set up a progressive taxation system to keep it funded into the future. He promised to cut government agencies like the Department of Energy and Education but ended up adding one of the largest — the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which today has a budget of nearly $90 billion and close to 300,000 employees. He also hiked defense spending by over $100 billion a year to a level not seen since the height of the Vietnam war.

5. Reagan did little to fight a woman’s right to choose. As governor of California in 1967, Reagan signed a bill to liberalize the state’s abortion laws that “resulted in more than a million abortions.” When Reagan ran for president, he advocated a constitutional amendment that would have prohibited all abortions except when necessary to save the life of the mother, but once in office, he “never seriously pursued” curbing choice.

6. Reagan was a “bellicose peacenik.” He wrote in his memoirs that “[m]y dream…became a world free of nuclear weapons.” “This vision stemmed from the president’s belief that the biblical account of Armageddon prophesied nuclear war — and that apocalypse could be averted if everyone, especially the Soviets, eliminated nuclear weapons,” the Washington Monthly noted. And Reagan’s military buildup was meant to crush the Soviet Union, but “also to put the United States in a stronger position from which to establish effective arms control” for the the entire world — a vision acted out by Regean’s vice president, George H.W. Bush, when he became president.

7. Reagan gave amnesty to 3 million undocumented immigrants. Reagan signed into law a bill that made any immigrant who had entered the country before 1982 eligible for amnesty. The bill was sold as a crackdown, but its tough sanctions on employers who hired undocumented immigrants were removed before final passage. The bill helped 3 million people and millions more family members gain American residency. It has since become a source of major embarrassment for conservatives.

8. Reagan illegally funneled weapons to Iran. Reagan and other senior U.S. officials secretly sold arms to officials in Iran, which was subject to a an arms embargo at the time, in exchange for American hostages. Some funds from the illegal arms sales also went to fund anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua — something Congress had already prohibited the administration from doing. When the deals went public, the Iran-Contra Affair, as it came to be know, was an enormous political scandal that forced several senior administration officials to resign.

9. Reagan vetoed a comprehensive anti-Apartheid act. which placed sanctions on South Africa and cut off all American trade with the country. Reagan’s veto was overridden by the Republican-controlled Senate. Reagan responded by saying “I deeply regret that Congress has seen fit to override my veto,” saying that the law “will not solve the serious problems that plague that country.”

10. Reagan helped create the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. Reagan fought a proxy war with the Soviet Union by training, arming, equipping, and funding Islamist mujahidin fighters in Afghanistan. Reagan funneled billions of dollars, along with top-secret intelligence and sophisticated weaponry to these fighters through the Pakistani intelligence service. The Talbian and Osama Bin Laden — a prominent mujahidin commander — emerged from these mujahidin groups Reagan helped create, and U.S. policy towards Pakistan remains strained because of the intelligence services’ close relations to these fighters. In fact, Reagan’s decision to continue the proxy war after the Soviets were willing to retreat played a direct role in Bin Laden’s ascendancy.
I'm not sure how a non-college grad has a lead in this race. Not a freaking chance. 

Please, nominate him.

Lets be honest, Jindal has no chance of winning.
Christie has supporters that need picking?  I don't see how that guy's viable nationally at this point.
The article is talking primarily about organizers, donors and the like, many of whom are still supporting Christie. This isn't about killing Christie's already very low chances, this is about Jeb getting more support. 
I understand the goal, I just mean, this seems unnecessarily covert.

Only surprise was Ted Cruz.
Slow and steady wins the race, eh? 
No way in fucking hell I'll be voting for Jeb.

could/should have started with paragraph 5
No more Mr Nice Guy, gosh darn it!
...this is satire right? Please tell me no one is actually taking this seriously.
Shouldn't. More members of the party are also becoming either secular or less affected by the religious bent on things. That's not to say they're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, but the more people 25-34 that realize you can be a good person + a conservative without referring to the bible every 10 seconds is a good thing. It blurs that line the dems seem so quick to throw up of "hey if you're a conservative you're a bible-thumping homophobe!". I for one am atheist as it gets but I'm as Republican as they come. For me the moral issue should be left to the states/people but the fiscal ones have a much greater impact and thus should be regulated by people who know how, not those solely looking to be re-elected by an uneducated populus
I agree being an atheist and a conservative are not mutually exclusive. The question is can the republican party put up someone that secular independents won't be repelled by when it comes to social issues.  Outstanding fiscal policies are meaningless if you can't get elected.
Who knew he was so attractive without that big, bushy mustache?
Very true, if a car has a million horsepower and runs on good vibes all that productivity is lost if the power doesn't get to the wheels. I'm hoping like you, that there will be a GOP candidate who can reconcile both the religious section of our party and their views with the more "mainstream" social views of 2015 and find a happy medium. I suppose that's the entire point of "leaving things to the state" and the goal of small government - letting the people of a certain locale govern themselves as they see fit - but that's getting harder and harder as the world becomes more interconnected.
nah, will stumble because he's Democrat lite
he's running.  who sets a date to say "I'm not" ?
It's really unlikely the party will die out because people are dying... worst case scenario is there will be another re-alignment. If that happens, though, it will happen because it was going to anyway and this issue will just have sped it up. It seems most young voters fall more towards the center on social issues nowadays, but the great divide happens in economic issues, and there will always be people who support the republican side of economic issues.
I think Fox News' average viewer age increases by 1.5 every year
Nobody likes grahamnesty 
A lot of the 18-25 crowd that Obama was so successful with will be 26-33, and they have jobs, kids, etc. A lot of them will come to the conclusion that the GOP is the only way to fly for working people.

[deleted]
Do you mean he's going to win the nomination and not win the Presidency, or do you mean he is not going to win the nomination at all? 
Do you have a source for that? That would be highly surprising to me. 
Within what timespan do you expect that to happen? 
It was one of those fluff military pieces on History or Discovery. I don't recall the actual details since it was a good 5 years ago when I saw it.

Another interesting fact is that the CIA has a special application filter set whenever a Borne movie comes out. Apparently they get applications in mass during their theater release.

Now that wouldn't surprise me at all. There's always a jump in college students declaring archaeology as a major in years where Indiana Jones movies come out. 
nomination is primary right now.  he polls as low as 4-5%

the crowd that claims it's all about money, they're still standing for now
Seems like we need more "Curing Cancer" blockbuser action movies.
So what probability do you assign to him winning the nomination? 
Which might also help deal with the problem the GOP is having discussed in the original article. 
15%
I expect you'll see signs of it in the upcoming election (2016).  By 2020 it'll be undeniable.
Interesting. So if someone offered you a bet where you got $10 if he didn't win, and paid $35 if he did win the nomination, would you take it? 
sure.  have you heard Jebster speak?  have you noticed the subjects he presses when he does speak?  have you witnessed the Democrat-lite posture of all that?  Romney wasn't enough (not conservative enough) so that makes the bet pretty much my cash
Ok. I'm willing to offer that bet now. Want to take it? 
Seems like a win-win for everyone, which is why it wont happen.
repeat the bet please
no chance to win the nomination. polls in the high teens (as in almost at the bottom) in a preference list

smoke and mirrors

the "plan" is resume enhancement and TV face time.  maybe a FOX job in 2020
I think he's running for Secretary of Defense. He'd do OK there and he'd open up a Senate seat for a so-called "true conservative" to take in SC.
OK, but he defeated a true conservative last election, right?
No good candidates ran in the GOP primary against Graham. Congressman Trey Gowdy is waiting for his opportunity to take Graham's seat and I'd guess he'd be appointed to replace Graham by the governor. Gowdy's another tea party star and, importantly, has an impressive resume. 
I love Trey's toughness and honesty
I respect Gowdy's resume. 
You get $10 if Bush is not the Republican nominee. You pay $35 if he is the nominee. 
Can you make possibly some concrete predictions for what you are expecting in 2020? 
The same group (ages 18-25) that overwhelmingly supported Obama in 2 elections will (by the time they are 30-37)  significantly support the GOP more.

I'm not saying they will majority support the GOP more, but it will sway significantly in that direction.

Not sure how concrete that is.
Hmm, I'm having trouble coming up with an easily testable version of this prediction because the standard age ranges for exit polls are 18-29 and 30-44 (see e.g. [here](http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/exit-polls)). There doesn't seem to be enough breakdown of exit polls by age to make an easily checkable version of this, which is too bad, because it is a very interesting prediction. 
30-44 would work for me.  That would've made them 18-32 when they voted for Obama in '08.
So, would at least 50% of the 30-44 age range will vote Republican in the 2020 election be a fair concrete version of your prediction? 
No, reread my post:

&gt;I'm not saying they will **majority** support the GOP more, but it will sway significantly in that direction.
Ah. So no more than 55% voting Democrat would be a fair prediction then? That would be 5% down from the 60%. 
I've made my prediction.  I'm not putting a number on it.  Like I said only time will tell.
I'm trying to make a specific version of the prediction so it can be actually checked. It is very useful to have actually testable predictions so one can check if one is modeling reality well. Otherwise it is very easy for people to convince themselves that vaguer predictions really do meet their standards. 
I don't care if I am right or wrong, and I most definitely don't care if you have the ability to quantify it or not.  
Confused I am. Why do you not care if you are right or wrong? Do you not want to have a more accurate view of reality if you can?

The Republican Party is in a demographic death spiral. Currently white children under the age of 5 are the minority. 15 years from now, white will be a minority in America. The USA will be a nation of minorities. The combination of Whites, Hispanics and Asians will outnumber Whites. Hispanics will be the largest of that minority group. And they vote Democrat. So in the future, Hispanics will decide elections. Who they like wins.

I agree with the article. Only the GOP thinks that the best way to expand their numbers is by keeping their ideas a secret. 

The GOP can talk a lesson from religion. In order to grow a religion is thru evangelism. Churches send preachers to people who don't know about Jesus.

Where are the Conservatives evangelist telling people about Conservative ideas. I am Hispanics. Republicans are never in my community. 
Around when do you expect this future to take place. The 2016 election or later? 
Did you read my post? I said 15 years.

Google it. White people are already a minority under the age of 5. So in 15 years or so America will start to look like South Africa. Whites will be the minority with Hispanics being the largest of all groups. Blacks, Hispanics and Asians vote Democrat. So if nothing changes the Republican Party is doomed.
Rubio/Kasich 2016? 
&gt; Did you read my post? I said 15 years

You said in 15 years whites would be a minority, but if one follows your logic, one should start seeing political repercussions well before that demographic event. I was asking the question in that context. 
It's to late. The number are already baked in. It's a done deal.

Whites will be 49% of the population and declining in 15 years.
&gt; It's to late. The number are already baked in. It's a done deal.

&gt; Whites will be 49% of the population and declining in 15 years.

Ok. So what repercussions do you expect to see before 15 years. Do you expect to see any repercussions in the near term political situation? 
Kasich looks better as a Presidential candidate than as a VP. He's a bit too cantankerous and impulsive to be a good VP candidate. 
Near term it will become harder and harder to win elections. The Republicans used to own California. They use to own Florida. Not anymore. Some say that Texas will switch to the Democrat camp. If that happens Republicans are in big trouble. Texas is the last big state that votes Republican. If Texas goes, Republicans do not own any big states.
Brilliant!  News that Mitt Romney was adding a car elevator to his California beach house during the 2012 election cycle, really helped connect him to the working class.

/s

In this case, the scale seems a lot smaller than the Romney car elevator. This is 3000 square feet on 1.3 acres, which is big but not that massive. The [median new house in the US is around 2600 square feet](http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/04/real_estate/american-home-size/), so this is only slightly larger than the norm. I don't have the data for the mean size off-hand but it is much larger than 2600. The only thing that really makes this a lot is the parcel of land which is big and the location. 

So this really isn't going to go over well but it will be more the optics than it actually being that massive as house.  
A home is one thing.

Few working class Americans can afford a $600,000 **vacation** home.

&gt; A home is one thing.

Yeah, that's a  valid point, and that undermines my analysis pretty heavily. 
What's the most extreme libertarian view you subscribe to?
Was there anything in particular that motivated your change? Or was it a realization of a gradual shift?
What's your view on the following:

* Obamacare
* Corporate welfare
* Tax cuts for the wealthy and trickle-down economics
* Fighting ISIS
Depends on what you consider extreme. I believe ALL taxation is theft. I believe humans should have complete control over their own bodies and ability to own any and all weaponry. No group of people(Ie. Government) should have a monopoly on violence. The summation of my beliefs is the Non-Aggression Principle.
Obamacare-just the same as any other form of socialist government thievery. Crony capitalism and corporate welfare are just as bad as socialism because it turns the populace against real freedom and leads to violence. Trickle down economics are based on the principle of taxes, which are morally wrong and violate people's freedoms and natural laws. ISIS was a reformation of an organization created entirely by our own foreign policy, any every intervention into the Middle East has created enemies  faster than we can kill them, so we should not intervene.
Great question. I was convinced originally that republicans were the party of small government, but interest in freedom and economics rapidly led to the realization that Republicans, no offense intended, support extremely large government and morally wrong policies.
Do Canada and Britain not have "real freedom?" Have they had violence because of their health care system?

They both have had socialized health care for a long time.
How would you pay for the military without taxation?
No, they do not, and from a libertarian perspective neither does the United States or pretty much any country.
You wouldn't, a libertarian model replaces military with civilian resistance. Research into human nature has discovered that people are more than willing to form voluntary collective defense, and can also take on the social policies such as charity that society sees as necessary.
Does the civilian resistance work in this day of age with advanced warfare (tanks, aircraft carriers, nuclear weapons, submarines)? How are civilians supposed to come up with the money to produce these things? Out of pocket? Donations? Taxation?
Another great great question. The way you organize a volunteer force is the same way you organize anything, people voluntarily pay a fund to finance the weaponry and theoretical payment to people who were willing to defend others.
Do you see any flaws in that logic?
There's a fundamental problem here. Defense is a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good). That means that people benefit from it even if they haven't paid into it. That means there's very little incentive in a voluntary system for almost anyone to pay anything, and the end result is that no defense will occur, and you'll get run over by marauders or the nearest nation-state. The same essential reason is why basic scientific research is most naturally funded by the government. Once something benefits everyone, a voluntary system of payment doesn't work. 
I do indeed, in that people with literally double the money cannot be judged by the same logic with which we judge people today. Humans in countless studies(will cite if needed) have been shown to be benevolent creatures. Myself and the vast majority of people are willing to pay and/or serve to protect our neighbors locally and worldwide. Though defense is the best argument for government, and would need a terraced de-escalation, it would be more efficient in a voluntary model. The current public good model has ALWAYS led to unpopular and morally disgusting wars and genocides, often in the name of patriotism.

I don't see how doubling resources should fundamentally alter human behavior. You have functionally much more than double the resources people would have had in 1900 and they had much more resources than someone would have had in 1800, but basic human behavior remains the same. Thinking that something will change when you double the amount of resources (why double incidentally?) is essentially wishful thinking.

As a general rule of thumb, the universe doesn't care about ideology. But humans frequently act like they must: this is why for example people who are pro-choice are so often convinced that allowing abortion will help low income groups economically, while people who are pro-life are convinced that allowing abortion causes all sorts of ills in lower socioeconomic groups. It is almost impossible to find someone who is pro-life who thinks that allowing abortion would help improve the economic situation for many, even as they are against it on philosophical grounds. 

In general, if you've made a conclusion that all the ideological arguments and all the predictions about how the universe will function happen to line up the same way, you may want to think carefully if you have some [motivated reasoning going on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning)

&gt; The current public good model has ALWAYS led to unpopular and morally disgusting wars and genocides, often in the name of patriotism.

The Crusaders were by and large volunteers going off to war with the same results. Volunteers can easily volunteer for genocide or other wars. Having volunteers doesn't make the population morally better people. 
Graham for Sec of Defense 2016! 
Your reasoning seems faulty to me, the difference between doubling of resources over time and immediate doubling would lead to vastly different circumstances. Double because the US government takes on average about 50% of a citizen's wages(state,federal,local income, sales, licensing, estate, property, and various other tax schemes, as well as the ultimate theft, runaway inflation). If the world doesn't run on ideology(and it obviously doesn't) then the myth of a ruling few knowing the moral best for the masses(government) is clearly faulty. In regards to my belief system, it is entirely based on human nature, rationalism, and economic theory.

In a world free of coercion you wouldn't have the rabidity of patriotism(the desire for a christian kingdom in the mid-E). A volunteer force better represents the will of the people and is more capable of defense due to the lack of limitations imposed by government.

What are you asking this in /r/republican for? Democrats/liberals are pro-union and republicans/conservatives are anti-union in general (obviously outliers in both parties). So most republicans, myself included, would say it can't be justified and wouldn't bother trying.
I simply wanted to see how opinions differed between the two parties (i posted to r/democrats and r/progressive as well). I wholeheartedly agree that the underlying reason for the union wanting the exemption is extremely self serving and will force the hands of employers to deal with the unions. All in all these laws are not a good thing they will empower inefficiency, shrink profit margins and ultimately move money to other (dare I say riskier) assets. 
That seems like a pretty unrealistic view, considering that modern warfare is fought with machines and technology that is both expensive and time consuming to research and build.

Modern weaponry cannot be scrapped together in short order, were another 9/11 to happen.
yall aristorats
9/11 was not a good reason for invasion despite petty fear and all that occurred was blowback. Blowback is making enemies faster than you can kill them.
Modern weaponry can be mobilized incredibly quickly, with speed increasing all the time.
I have three questions for you.
1. Have you heard of costa rica?
2. Why did the Japanese not invade the mainland?
3. Why did the U.S. fail in the Vietnamese war?
Obama, Clinton, Bush, Walker, Rubio, Cruz, Huckabee, Christie, Santorum, and Pataki all support endless war, endless debt, and  an expanding police state. What’s the difference?

Don’t you wish someone favored peace, a balanced budget, and freedom?

For what it's worth this independent attitude will have me registering republican so I can view for him in the primary.
I quit respecting Hume about 5 years ago
It's for this reason that he has my support.
The monied class is not donating to Rand at all. He's undermining our national security and they find it to be too much of a risk! 
Hume's a great guy. Rand's a certifiable nut case. 
Is this a joke? 
Nope. Did you read the article? Outside of that nut Rand Paul the rest of the field is OK on foreign policy. He's not actually running to be President. He knows his chances are slim to none. 
as bad as our foreign scene is, it always domestic policies that people get excited about in the voting booth
Didn't he just announce today that he is in fact running for president?
Yep. 
Narrow-minded disrespectful a-holes in this video.
yea, he's already set up his exit saying if he doesn't win NH and/or IA he'll quit and back some other candidate (B ush?)
Rubio versus Hillary? Rubio versus *Sanders*? LOL. 
All I'm hearing is the same crap I hear from every Paul campaign: a bunch of whining that the candidate can't do what he wants because other people won't let him. This isn't an attitude I want to see in a president. 

The Pauls and their fan base need to read Patton's speech:

&gt;When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big-league ball players and the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and **will not tolerate a loser.** Americans play to win all the time.


Not really saying much considering Hitler would probably out poll Obama "The Constitutional Scholar (LOL)"
And Carter outpolled GWB....

So....? Ex presidents often poll better than current ones. Apples and Oranges.  

Lets remember that GWB at his 7th year in office was 30% vs 49% in this poll.

Reagan was also around 49% and clinton was over 60%. 

No. Just no. Please. That's just nonsense.
&gt;Lets remember that GWB at his 7th year in office was 30% vs 49% in this poll.

Speaking of apples and oranges.... Obama's 7th year is very different from Bush's 7th year. The world goes in cycles and this year is in a different cycle than Bush's 7th year was.

But for the most part you're right. It really doesn't mean a lot about Obama. It's interesting to see Bush's numbers head up but we still have a few decades to go before we can see how Bush actually rates.
I'll push back a little on this. Bush's poll ratings hit 50% in the start of his 6th year and went down from there. 

The approval poll isn't just a tide that goes in and out.  It's a critique on how well the president is responding to the situations at the time.   

Bush had a shit economy that the people he hired didn't see coming. And when people were losing their jobs and retirement he wasn't responding to it well. 

Obama has Isis which he cocked up in stopping and his response to it is to bomb from the air only and ground troops from other countries.  Which there are worse responses. 
Obviously. It's a fucking hyperbole... I don't literally mean people approve of one of the most evil people in modern history over a mediocre president. 
Fun fact that my liberal international politics professor threw my way last semester: Al Gore was probably more likely to have invaded Iraq than Bush (though the battle plan would have been slightly different).
John Bolton is not relevant.  Go away.
Josh Bolton is a great American statesman he'll be playing a key role in the 2016 GOP nomination process. From the sidelines. 
That's a good one.
He must have figured that Lindsey Graham would be enough to play the "adult in the room" with foreign policy credentials on the debate stage. Some of the others like Rubio are OK on foreign policy as well, but Graham and Bolton are just stronger with much more experience. Bolton entering the race would only lessen the chances of either one of them (Graham or Bolton) making it into those "top 10" debates. 

I like Rubin's idea to have Bolton moderate a foreign policy debate. 
I didn't realize the only way to qualify as an "adult" is to support sending other peoples' kids to fight in wars that have nothing to do with our national security.
No one here is advocating for such a thing. Take your idiotic straw man to a sub where folks might buy it, such as /r/RandPaul or /r/SandersForPresident.

White people are so mistaken about Marco Rubio. They keep saying that "he is Hispanic". So what. That means nothing to people who speak Spanish. Why? Because he is a Cuban. It's almost like you are not Latino calling yourself Cuban. A black man who thinks like a white guy is called an Oreo. Black on the outside, white on the inside. Cubans are the Oreos in the Hispanic community in the US.

Marco Rubio better not take the Latino vote for granted. Because he will not automatically win the Latino vote.

Does that justify lying to get into iraq to set up the fairly imperialist chess pieces described in neocon docs ranging from PNAC's RAD, Wolfowitz doctrine, to A Clean Break by IASPS? 


Because neocon doctrine of the Bush area and warhawk operations of Obama has done very little good and pretty much ruined the middle east, and even the CIA isnt even sure of Israel being a nation at the end of this decade. They were smart in their intentions and rise to power, but boy did the Bush admin know how to lay an egg (and Obama sure didnt make the mess any better).

Marriage is a contract. Government should not be discriminating about who can enter into contracts.

As far as government is concerned all marriage should be considered civil contracts, leave marriage to the private sector.

If they nominate Rubio, the Hispanic vote is pretty much captured because a Hispanic is going to see an elitist white woman or a middle class looking Hispanic. 
I don't think the hispanic vote is going to be a deciding factor. Seems like more of a distraction than anything else. 
Rubio will make Hispanics take a second look. But he still has his work cut out for him. He is Cuban American, which means that he will not be liked all the much.

It's like saying, "How do we get the Irish vote. I know. Let's get a Brit to run for office."
I'm not saying he will be liked, I'm saying he will beat Clinton with the Hispanics. 
What do you guys think about the ruling that happened on Thursday? 
He's a Cuban. And as far as I know (I am of Mexican descent), Mexicans aren't that fond of Cubans since their immigrating people aren't treated like shit once they get their feet on US soil. 

If you really want the majority of the Latino vote, [come up with something alike Bush's plan of immigration.](http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/George_W__Bush_Immigration.htm) You'll also need to emphasis with **granting an automatic path to citizenship** part of Bush's plan. One last thing, don't do what Donald Trump did. You're going to have a bad time if you generalized them as criminals. 
This is largely a [generational divide](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/08/graphics-slideshow-changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/
).  The Silent Generation overwhelmingly opposes gay marriage while the Millennials overwhelmingly support gay marriage.

If the GOP wants to win back the White House, they need to downplay their opposition to gay marriage and start talking about how to create an environment for economic growth and prosperity.


It's interesting that the percentage change is actually greater for the Silent Generation than it is for the Baby Boomers or Gen X. 

For the really old folks I've talked to, it also seems like the strength of their opposition to same-sex marriage is also less than for Baby Boomers. I wonder if that's because they're more likely to have grandkids that are gay?

If the GOP really wanted to attract the attention of Millenials and Generation X, they'd also support legal marijuana. Their corporate masters are already salivating at the prospect of huge profits so it's only a matter of time. 
Conditional on Rubio winning the nomination, how likely do you think he is to win the general? 
I'm confident he would win the general, but there is a list of a ton of random shit that can happen between then in politics. 
Confident is how much? More than 60%? More than 70%? 
I would go with 70% as my set in stone, that includes any random things that could happen. What about you?
Yes. Compared to Cruz, Santorum, or if hell froze over, Trump?  In a heartbeat. 
I want to see how well he does in debates and get a better understanding of his views, but if Jeb Bush wins the primary, then I would take a hard look at Webb. 
There are a small handful of GOP Presidential candidates who are rightfully taking a 10th amendment stand on marijuana -- let the states decide and keep the feds out.  They include Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Rick Perry. 

Unfortunately, others like Chris Christie (who said he would crack down on states who legalized marijuana) just don't get it.


Thanks for the Reply.

I always thought that the rest of Latin America did not like Cubans because Fidel supported Communist Rebels throughout Central and South America. I thought that caused a lot of resentment by non Cubans. Fidel caused many deaths over the years.

Who do you like from the GOP candidates?
If I had my choice, Paul.
I'd guess almost exactly 50%, maybe 55% for Rubio. The sort of logic you've used is compelling, but the poll numbers don't seem to back it up, and show Hillary winning in a straight-matchup against Rubio. (See [here](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/)). On the other hand, some of Clinton's advantage in the polls at this point is name recognition and she definitely has more at this point than Rubio, so one would expect that aspect to equalize more if he gets the nomination. He does seem to be one of the stronger candidates if he gets to the general. So I guess 70% seems too high, but not unreasonably so. 
Don't get me wrong, the primaries are going to be hell for every candidate. We will be able to discuss things better a little bit into the primary when some people start to drop out and the strong candidates begin to show.

In terms of minorities(which are growing in voter numbers) tend to vote for a minority candidate, here is an example from the 2008 election and 2012 election:

http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/
Black people voted democrat? You don't say... 
...according to Bernie Sanders

...and only becuase he's continuing to [repeat bullshit](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/02/bernie-s/sen-bernie-sanders-says-texas-republicans-want-abo/) &amp; relies on the Texas GOP as representative of a broad umbrella phrase.
The Eisenhower Republican party was also active during one of the most peaceful and prosperous times in the past century, times change and so do ideas. 
Trump, Cruz and Walker are my top three
So beer is better for you then marijuana?! Also, hasn't there been extensive research on the effects of marijuana? 
Winning the hispanic vote isn't all that important to Republican victory and suggesting large numbers of people vote based on the shared skin colour of the candidate is just wrong. Hispanic voters are more economically vulnerable and less likely to have access the healthcare than the average american, so they will tend towards the party with solutions for them. At present thats the Democratic party. Its the same reason the Republican party does so poorly with single mothers.
Doesn't surprise me, people are tired of politicians beating around the bush. 
Trump is excellent but makes me nervous Jebster is so high (still)
The Republicans who are flocking to Trump are now less likely to support Rubio. 
Yeah, and I think Rubio has the best chance of winning the general, but I also like Trump, but he has less of a chance winning the general. We will see how things pan out sooner or later. 
Why do you like Trump? 
I like him because of him saying what comes to his mind, very rare in a politician, but I'm not going to be drinking the kool-aid and say he has this awesome chance of winning the general election, its slim that he would win. 

I will say, stranger things have happened in presidential elections like, Carter a peanut farmer, Reagan a movie actor, and Obama a second term. 
Carter and Reagan were governors. Obama's reelection was the odds on favorite for the entire campaign. And i don't get the appeal of saying what's on your mind when what is on your mind is horrible. I can excuse an incident here and there in exchange for that directness but other than his attacks on Mexico what does Trump offer? 
You and I can agree to disagree. 
Of course we can. I'm trying to understand the appeal of Trump. Sanders is a straight speaker too, I assume you completely reject him anyway. Is there anything else about Trump that you like? I would have to guess that you like the underlying idea of strong immigration control. 


I like Sanders straight talking as well, but not his ideas. Trump offers a no bullshit republican candidate with little ties to interest groups, all the other candidates have to pander to organizations, but Trump doesn't, same with Sanders. 

Immigration is not that important to me, but I would like our borders protected, and pretty much any thing Trump said I'm behind in terms of ideas except some of the social issues that haunt the Republican party. 
funny, I was just snookered into hearing Alan Colmes
Does this include his proposals for the Middle East? That we just bomb the oil fields and do enough bombing that we don't need ground troops?

Yes, but of course he means there are going to be ground troops, he's leaving that part out. There are going to be troops on the ground no matter what president gets elected or Iraq will fall, I mean even Obama is sending some troops. 
So you like the "bomb the hell out of the oil fields" part?
Wow.
Wow, what? That was a quote from Trump. I'm trying to understand why you like Trump. 
If it the general election was a pro-amnesty Republican versus Jim Webb then I would seriously consider Jim Webb. 
I would still really have to think about it tho
Trump 2016.

Because he's the hero 'Murica deserves, but not the one it needs right now, so we'll hunt him. Because he can take it, because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a Trump Knight.

stupid post
Looking at who is in first place at this point is a bad idea and anyone who knows politics should know better. There are so many contenders (not just pretenders) in the race that being first still means you have little support. You just have slightly more than the next guy. 

The only way it would mean anything is if as candidates drop out their supporters back the other candidates in the same ratio as the overall poll. Which is silly. There is no reason to think that if Rick Perry leaves the race his supporters will go to Trump, Cruz, and Bush in the same ratios as the current polls. They will likely split heavily towards one of the candidates and that will blow the current polls up.

Our local GOP had a [straw poll](http://tdn.com/gop-poll-results/pdf_8658ac33-be4e-5b9f-8515-f84369d0e7db.html) over the 4th of July weekend. Extremely unscientific but the part that sticks out and makes it quite obvious that Trump won't win is the Last Choice selection. Trump wins that hands down. Which means that as the other candidates leave their supporters are unlikely to break for Trump and the fewer candidates there are the further behind he will fall.

Trump is not Reagan. And that this is even a conversation really shows how out of step with reality some of the conservative "thinkers" in our Party are today.
[Reagan would never eat NY-style pizza with a fork](http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/0ect4f/me-lover-s-pizza-with-crazy-broad). How can we trust someone who can't even find a decent pizza place in NYC with the presidency?
&gt; The only way it would mean anything is if as candidates drop out

soon, about 10 will drop out, maybe more
Who cares where he ate for pizza? Donald's a rich guy wearing expensive clothes. It's OK that he doesn't want to get his hands greasy. Get a grip son! 
Ronald Reagan was not some wuss that didn't want to get his hands greasy while eating some of the best food America has to offer. Ronald Reagan celebrated what was great about America and that includes our cultural food.

It's fine if you support Trump. But don't compare him to Reagan. That's all I'm saying.
Ronald Reagan was not a billionaire who wore such expensive clothing. He was a more ordinary man. Trump obviously cares about making America great. He wants to stop the illegal border crossings and sanctuary cities, he wants to negotiate deals that are favorable to us instead of deals that are favorable to the other party. 

When did I say that I support Trump? It is perfectly reasonable to compare the media and establishment GOP reaction to Trump to how Reagan was treated. 
I just said it was fine if you support Trump. I didn't say you did.

And if Trump can't afford to clean his clothes then what kind of billionaire is he?

&gt;It is perfectly reasonable to compare the media and establishment GOP reaction to Trump to how Reagan was treated.

It's moronic and embarrassing.  It's like comparing the media coverage of Stalin and Brittney Spears. Sure you can find some things that are similar but it doesn't mean anything.

Trump's candidacy is not comparable to Reagan's candidacy. 1976 to 2012 nor 1980 to 2016.
I see Trump's candidacy as comparable to not only Reagan's but also Perot's. 

Trump's been able to get the media to report more on and Democrats to denounce sanctuary cities. Looks to me like he's winning. This of course makes sense, Trump is the most media savvy candidate in the field today. Reagan, a former actor,  was also pretty media savvy. 
Trump is working for Hillary to make the GOP look bad and alienate Hispanic voters. He is a Democrat, just as bad as any of the rest of them. He donated thousands of dollars to Hillary's 2008 campaign, as well as the campaigns of several Democratic congressman and the Clinton foundation. He supports a single-payer healthcare system, a wealth tax, and other things that no real Republican would support. 
&gt; He was a more ordinary man.

He was a famous actor, but he didn't have an inflated ego like Donald Trump.

&gt; Trump obviously cares about making America great. He wants to stop the illegal border crossings and sanctuary cities, he wants to negotiate deals that are favorable to us instead of deals that are favorable to the other party.

He also supports single payer healthcare, a wealth tax, tariffs, etc. and is always saying something that makes the Republican party look bad to independents and other potential voters (i.e. Claiming Obama wasn't born in the US, his recent comments about Hispanics). He also claims Bill Clinton was the best president of his lifetime and he has donated to Hillary's previous campaigns, including her 2008 presidential campaign. He is likely working for Hillary Clinton or the Democratic party to make the GOP look bad and alienate Hispanic voters, because they know we can't continue to win elections without support from Hispanics. 
Anyone who runs for the Presidency has an inflated ego. Silverbug, eh? Your name makes you sound like one of those Ron Paul nuts. 
Yes, I voted for Ron Paul twice. I will vote for Rand Paul in the upcoming primaries. We need real Conservatives, not big government neocon warhawks like the Bushes. 


Ron Paul isn't a conservative, Rand Paul is a chip off the old block. 

Mitt Romney is about ideal for me. If you want a 'true conservative' there's Ted Cruz. The Pauls are just too loony and too out of step with the conservative movement. They're not really conservatives, they are Libertarians.

This is basically a Non-Issue now. It won't end well for anyone trying to overturn it either. 
The issue left is at what point do people cross the line from freedom of religion to discrimination, as perfectly demonstrated by Indiana. 

I personally feel as a business owner you should have the right to refuse service from anyone, though I do not approve of any kind of discrimination. Unless say, each business must have a sign stating who they will not serve, regardless of the arbitrary reasons. 

No shoes
No shirts
No blacks. 

Sounds pretty bad, will they risk the consequences of those actions?
You already have the right to refuse service to anyone, so you don't have to have a sign that says, "No jerks. No cussing. No screaming kids".

On the other hand, federal and state laws prevent discrimination to various protected classes: religion, race, disabled, etc. But for most states, gays are not protected from discrimination on employment, housing, services, etc. In an at-will state, an employer could fire you if they just thought you were gay.

I like the idea of a sign law, but can't imagine any state legislature passing such a law. On the other hand, I can imagine a business in a small rural town in the South that had a sign that said, "No Muslims, Catholics, Jews, Mormons, Mexicans, Blacks, Asians, or anyone else who isn't a native-born White American gun-toting citizen".
some would say that the fact we're talking about him not hurting the GOP, is hurting the GOP

those would also say that he brings nothing to the party, and only manages to give the left ammo against us. 

I do not find him to be a viable candidate - but at this moment time, no one is. 
At-will? Didn't think that was still a thing. That's horrible, not just for the discrimination, but the risk of being fired for any any, or more specifically, no reason. Now that's something I wouldn't mind being rid of nationally.

For such a crazy person he certainly knows how to manipulate the media and the DC establishment to his advantage. Bottom line is Trump is a genius and an expert in dealing with the media. 
[deleted]
to me, the only possible way Trump could hurt the GOP is to further reveal how insider politics works...good old boys ("leadership") clinging to power regardless of the damage to America, e.g. borders, Obamacare rolling on
Trump is not a genius for getting on the news. A girl who bathes in cereal can get on the news and an interview with the POTUS. The media bar is really fucking low these days.
I don't know if you know what troll means... 
He got Democrats to denounce sanctuary cities and he's making everyone take a stand on illegal immigration. Trump is winning, and he doesn't even need to win a single primary! 
funny. he didnt think they sucked 2 months ago. in fact he must've thought they were pretty good since he did business with him. or does he routinely do business with shitty companies? If so that makes him a lousy businessman, right?
&gt;or does he routinely do business with shitty companies? 

He does business with his Atlantic City casinos so yes.
It’s because the modern republican party is horrific and full of ignorant assholes.
No one believes his message is hurting the GOP in the general election?  Even if he gets out of the primary, he will be greatly disadvantaged with Hispanic voters.

Bush has a far better chance at the general election. 
The difference is that Reagan never made such offensive comments when e was running for President. 
Reagan wasn't all smiles and "morning in America". He said tough things and pointed the finger, making enemies just as Trump did. 
Trump has always been extremely sensitive about people not taking him seriously.

&gt; Some have speculated that the lack of a presidential proclamation might be because as tragic and senseless as they were, the Chattanooga deaths involved members of the U.S. armed forces who are considered to have been killed in the line of duty ... doing so at a national level would require the President to pick and choose among service deaths to decide which to so honor.

Of course, everyone can decide to fly their own flag at half-staff, it's a free country.  There's just no value in this bad rhetoric...

We already have a president that's all for amnesty too. Guess that rules out Rubio. 
Video clearly shows costs were for shipping and not for profit. Not for profit repeatedly stated in videos. Somehow, dumbass Republicans still think these videos prove something.
&gt;Q: While illegals are going to have to wait 15 years before they can become citizens, they get "probationary legal status." Isn't that amnesty?

&gt;RUBIO: [Illegal residents] don't get anything. What they get is the opportunity to apply for [citizenship]. They still have to pass the background checks; pay a registration fee; and they don't qualify for any federal benefits.

&gt;Q: Most people think once they have that status, even if it's called temporary, it's never going to get revoked.

&gt;RUBIO: Under the existing law today, if you are illegally in the US, you are not prohibited from getting citizenship. The only thing is, you have to go back to your home country, you have to wait 10 years. We're going to create an alternative that says, OK, you want to stay here, you have to wait more than 10 years, you have to be gainfully employed. It will be cheaper, faster and easier for people to go back home and wait 10 years than it will be to go through this process. And that's why it's not amnesty.

eat eat eat...eat our own

hey Rubio, it's much classier to SHUT UP....geez
How bout he takes a dig at Clinton? 
Clinton, Obama, administration policies...all good targeting
True that lol. 
He did do it. It wasn't announced but my friend and I saw flags all at half and wondered what was up. A quick Google revealed it was for the shootings.

Perhaps you wanted something bigger.
I think there should be more regulation on guns through background checks to make sure mentally ill people can't purchase guns as easily as others, but you must remember that they can still own guns so they could purchase them from a friend. This serves as a deterrent, but the gov. can't come out and say that mentally ill people can't own a gun, that's a straight infringement. 

Next up is to educate the public about guns and encourage larger gun ownership and concealed carry spots. Most of these shootings would have have been ended in seconds if somebody was concealed carrying, and the best part of concealed carry is you have to be a trusted individual and law abiding citizen to receive one, so they're the only ones who posses them. 

For mentally ill people I really don't have an answer especially since mentally ill or disturbed can be stretched a lot. Most shooters are mentally ill and disturbed, but in the grand scheme of things they showcase a sliver of the mentally ill people, so basing reform on these incidents is not smart. 

At the end of the day, as the NRA said best, the only way to stop a person with a gun, is another person with a gun. 
I posted this prior to him coming out with the order.  Too little...too late IMHO
Well keep harboring that disappointment and nurse the resentment. 
[deleted]
haha oh god are you actually serious
In theory, using background checks to prevent mentally ill people from owning guns sounds fine, but it doesn't work in practice.

First, how do we decide if someone is mentally ill?  If you require reporting anyone seeking any kind of mental care, you'll create a huge disincentive to seek mental care.

You could also require a psych evaluation prior to gun purchase, but that cause a number of secondary problems:  

 1. you significantly increase the cost of gun ownership, disenfranchising the poor and middle class. 
 2. By increasing the cost of guns, you make black market guns more lucrative, further reducing the impact of any kind of gun control you seek to enact. 
 3. Many of the people who are deeply disturbed and liable to enact mass violence would pass a simple psych evaluation.  It takes multiple sessions with a trained psychiatrist to identify these individuals. 
 4. As the psych evaluation is ultimately subjective, it could be used to arbitrarily deprive people of their gun rights: "You're transgender, so you must be mentally ill.  You can't have a gun."
 5. Not all mental illness is the same.  Are people who suffer acute depression disallowed from owning a gun?  What about people who are OCD disallowed from owning a gun?
 6. A bad doctor could permanently prevent you from having a gun.  Can you appeal the psych evaluation?  Can you get re-evaluated?  What about doctors who'll take a bribe to pronounce you "cured"?

On your second point, by your language, I'm assuming you think all Republicans hate all social welfare programs.  Not true at all. You create a straw man by lumping all "social welfare programs" together.  Not all welfare programs are created equal.

There's a big difference in my mind between a social welfare program designed to help the mentally ill and a social welfare program like long-term unemployment that creates a perverse incentive to remain unemployed.

I can only speak for myself at this point, but I think we do too *little* for mental health care.  I'd love to see more tax dollars spent on those kinds of programs.  However, you also have to overcome the cultural stigma against seeking mental health care.  Too many believe that only the "crazies" should have to go see a psychiatrist or counselor, but the reality is far different.

Gun violence is deplorable, but in the grand scheme of violent deaths, it represents only a sliver of the total.  For a comparison, in 2013, firearms caused just over 11,000 deaths (including suicides, which make up over 60%), while almost 33,000 people died in car accidents and over 600,000 people died of heart disease.  If a crazed individual chose to, they could probably cause a lot more death with a car (which almost everyone is trained to use) than with a gun (which few mass shooters are ever trained to use).
Best answer yet. I also don't think gun violence or terrorism deaths are an issue. Just shitty luck if you die to that. But don't post that unpopular opinion on FB.

I'd like to see reduced stigma with getting behavioral help as difficult as it is. Med still need a while to go before the benefits outweigh the side effects for some. 
How can this asshole consider himself Libertarian?
The medication issue is a good point, and one that is really troubling for mental heath issues.

Modern pharmacology is advanced, especially with regards to mental health, and we have drugs that will help the vast majority of the mentally ill.  The problem is that each individual drug has much lower success than that.  This requires a complex trial and error method to try and determine both the correct drug and the correct dose to solve people's issues.

Now, once you've found the right drug, you have to combat its side effects.  That may require another whole trial-and-error round. And so on.

After all that, you've then got to *keep* people on their medicine.  This isn't just getting them to take it; how can they afford it? And the sad reality is that many people with debilitating mental illnesses will never be self-sufficient without some sort of pharmaceutical aid.  Which means that if medicine access dries up, most likely, any kind of life they've built for themselves is gone as well, and it's back to square one.
Pretty much the reason mental health needs.much more improvement with hospice or assisted living systems. Possibly with vocational jobs they can do to make money and support their lifestyle.

Mental illness is so multifaucted it can't be solved overnight.
At this point I still have no idea. I have yet to see anyone from either party that I can truly get behind. In the end it'll probably be whoever has a realistic conservative economic policy but is more neutral/liberal leaning on the environmental side of things. I'd like to see some "IDGAF" from the social side of things as well, i'm a little tired of all the "PC" bullshit being spewed across the end of Obamas reign. The social aspect alone is one of the reasons I think Trump even managed to gain some ground, he's eccentric but for the first time in a long time he's a politician that is speaking his mind whether people like it or not. I'd rather know someones beliefs and not agree with them, than be fed a line of political bullshit and be backpedaled on later.
It's still early, and it's difficult to predict what will happen between now and next year. But I like Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Carla Fiorini, and Bobby Jindal.

I tend to vote for the more business and economy focused candidates. We all want to feed the poor, house the homeless, improve schools, and reduce crime. But naive populists like Bernie Sanders think that they can make that happen exclusively. The truth is that we have to stabilize the economy and ensure a solid tax base first. And you can't do that without strong business and investment.
Leaning towards Marco Rubio at this point... 
Paul.  

He's the least out there.  Yes I know he's taking a chainsaw to the tax code.  He's also the only one who can clearly beat Clinton.  
I want trump. I don't understand why people wouldn't want to vote for him. He is a great candidate. 
Rubio or Rand Paul. 

Why? Because I want a candidate that can win in the general election.
Wow!

Obviously the writer of this article does not know any Hispanics. Even non Mexican are insulted by Trumps mouth.
My wife is a brown-skinned legal immigrant of hispanic descent and she approves of what Trump said about illegal immigrants. Trump is right on immigration! 
&gt;Rand Paul ... win in the general election

LOL
I live in a Latino community and the people I have spoke with hate Trump. They call him a racist.

Then when I watch Telemundo or Univision, when Trump is talked about, they call him a racist.

From what I seen on TV and in my community, it seems that Trump is finished with the Latino vote. It is sort of like when Mitt Romney said that Hispanics can self deport themselves. That was a mild statement and it cost Mitt Romney the Latino vote.  Trump outright insulted Mexicans. What you think will happen to him?
I remember reading an article written by a Liberal Democrat that said he will vote for Rand because he is the real deal when it comes to civil liberties. In that article he said that he is not alone.

Rand can get a lot more Democrats to vote for him than any other Republican candidate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEyOglaXczU
Rand Paul has big problem. He's his father's son and wouldn't be in office without his dad's support. He in fact reached out to all of his dad's lunatic constituencies when he first ran, even appearing on the Alex Jones Show numerous times. He's gotten himself caught up with some characters like the "southern avenger", which doesn't help him with efforts to distance himself from his white supremacist father. Rand's a sure loser's bet, which helps to explain why he's gotten so little from big donors in Super PAC money. 
Trump praised the Mexican people and even said their leaders are smarter than our leaders. He is against **illegal** immigrants. 

It's unreasonable to call Trump a racist based on what he said about illegal immigrants. It actually is sort of racist to claim that Trump was wrong and that Mexico is sending their 'best'. No, other countries like the Philippines and India send some of their best. We get the riffraff from Mexico. It's not racist to point that out. 
A lot of liberals would argue that rebuilding the middle class and lifting people out of poverty is one of the best ways to stabilize an economy. 
How is he a great candidate in your opinion? For me he is the exact symbol of what I think is wrong with our country: too much corporate influence, whether its Hillary or Bush, or Trump. I also feel that he poorly understands foreign policy, he's a businessman. His comments on Iran make me worried. 
True, he is different, and people want change. 
Why?
I hope Clinton doesn't win the primaries. XD
Why are you so sure that Rubio or Paul could win the general election over candidates like Bush or Trump?
I won't be happy with anything short of an indictment and conviction.
I feel similarly towards George W Bush. 
Those liberals greatly misunderstand how money, wealth, and the economy work. They also fail to understand that a thriving middle class is the result of a strong economy, not the cause, and that artificially raising costs actually hurts the people they claim to help.
What crimes do you feel Bush committed?
He genuinely cares about this country. He does not lie to us like Obama does all of the time. He seems promising. He wants to fix this debt and not by making stimulus plans. He wants to help out the poor the correct way. Which is not through welfare, it is through helping corporates in order for them to hire more people. He understands how things work considering he is a businessman. He also wants to eliminate Isis and the new bullshit plan Obama has with Iran. People need to understand that he genuinely really wants his country to succeed and he has the correct ways of doing it, in my opinion of course. 

I would love to debate this with you, no hard feelings say whatever. It's interesting to here different points of view.
&gt; He genuinely cares about this country. 

Trump probably does care about America.

&gt; He does not lie to us like Obama does all of the time. 

What does Obama lie about all the time?

&gt; He seems promising. He wants to fix this debt and not by making stimulus plans. He wants to help out the poor the correct way. Which is not through welfare, it is through helping corporates in order for them to hire more people. 

This is actually the incorrect way. Corporations are all about improving efficiency on larger scales, creating more production with less labor. Corporations do not create jobs. Small businesses create a vast majority of the jobs in America, not giant Corporations. Providing welfare is actually a great way to help the poor, so long as the system ensures they use it only to get back on their feet and not abuse and leech from taxpayers.

&gt; He understands how things work considering he is a businessman. 

Probably true.

&gt; He also wants to eliminate Isis and the new bullshit plan Obama has with Iran. 

Everyone except ISIS wants to eliminate ISIS. Also, the nuclear deal with Iran opens up their facilities to inspection by our government, allowing us to ensure Iran doesn't build a nuke. The deal isn't just Obama's, it's signed by most European countries as well and will take effect regardless if the US is involved or not. Anyone who understands the details of the plan know it's a good deal. Anyone calling it "bullshit" has been subjected to pro-Israel (and therefore anti-Iran) propaganda.

I would love to debate this with you, no hard feelings say whatever. It's interesting to here different points of view.

:)
The invasion of Iraq, and the sanctions we put on them. Sanctions don't prevent nuclear weapons or hurt the government, they kill poor people and children. We had not reason to invade: there were no terrorists with connections in Iraq or WMD's in Iraq. Sanctions alone killed 500,000 children, and the invasion killed many more, and its effects continue to kill people until today. Sadam Hussein was a terrible man, but by killing him we killed many many more people, most of whom were innocent, and we failed to establish a new government that is effective in any way. We also lost thousands of troops for no reason, and a trillion dollars. I believe that Bush committed war crimes against the Iraqi people.
I think Western Europe is an example of how liberal economics can be extremely successful. I don't think that one is inherently better than the other, but I think liberals would lift people out of poverty faster to say the least. Capitalism works, but it works fucking slow. The invisible hand take centuries, and people don't live centuries.
Replace Obama with 95% of politicians, because almost all of them lie to us, Republican or Democrat. The main problem with helping poor with jobs is that a lot of jobs have extremely low wages, and that jobs take a long time to put in place. I also believe that healthcare and education are RIGHTS not privileges; their costs are too high, due to inflation for profit committed by hospitals.  The US has been fighting ISIS, but we could up airstrikes, of course boots-on-the-ground should never be an option; local powers can win given US support and airstrikes, which will save the US money and lives, and help keep us out of the conflict and away from Iraqi/Syrian public opinion. "Obama's" plan with Iran is actually a step in the right direction, if you've studied the middle east or nuclear politics. Iran wants a nuke because we threatened to invade them in the Bush era (Axis of Evil speech). Sanctions have never prevented anyone from developing a nuke, e.g. North Korea had way less income and was sanctioned but developed nuclear weapons. Iran is hostile because the US has been historically hostile and unwilling to negotiate since 1979, when Iran overthrew the dictator we put in place in 1953, in place of their democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh. Another conflict is not what this country needs, we are in enough debt, and this problem can be solved peacefully. Although the Ayotallah may seem it, he isn't crazy, it's just a scare tactic. He knows the US has thousands of nuclear weapons, he isn't stupid.
So, what laws are you looking at?  

Also, would you be going after everyone who voted for it?
That's not accurate at all. Liberal economics are what dragged countries like the UK and most of Eastern Europe into deep recession. It wasn't until the fall of the Soviet Union and the Thatcher era that those nations turned around and became prosperous. Embracing freer markets and less direct government subsidy and control turned those economies around in years, not centuries.
"but mah pandering" - - jeb bush 
Why Rubio? 92% compatibility on the issues via ["I side with"](https://www.isidewith.com/) *and* he could actually win in the general - successfully winning the Hispanic vote.
Nobody really wants any more Bush and Trump is a walking gaffe-machine. (And for the record, nobody really wants any more Clinton either... hence Bernie's recent traction.)
The nuclear deal with Iran, we give them 24 days to prepare for our inspection. That is bullshit. They could move all of there weapons out in 24 days in preparation for the inspections. That is complete bullshit.
Forgot to add this to the last comment. The problem with government programs like welfare is the fact that people are leeching off of it. They sit on there ass because they know they don't have to get a job. Obviously some people need it like veterans, but the real unemployment right now is 26%. People on welfare also have flat screen tvs, drink and smoke. They have tons of things they do not need while they are taking government checks from tax payers. They are lazy ass bums who have no desire to work at all and are not contributing to the society at all.
Obama has lied to his country many many times. He has had 24 scandals that if they were scandals a republican did, the republican president would be impeached. If you are asking for examples. Spying on Germany's phones, Mexican drug cartel.

Sorry for all of these separate messages.

Marco Rubio and Rand Paul are the candidates that have the best chance to win. Here is why.

The GOP needs the Hispanic Vote

If you can't get enough Hispanics to vote for you, then you have to get Democrats to cross party lines. Who can do that? Rand Paul. Here is an example of a Democrat who wants to vote for Rand.

I didn't know about the 24 day rule. If that's accurate then you're right... it is bullshit. 
It goes both ways. When there's a Democratic president the Republicans will attack him for every little thing, whether deserved or not. When there's a Republican president the Democrats will attack him for every little thing, whether it's deserved or not. Both sides are guilty of partisan nonsense when the other side is in the white house. There isn't really any higher ground in politics. 

Thanks for the link, btw! I checked it out and went through the 24 scandals one by one. (I know, I need a life.)

The only legitimate scandals I can see involving Obama are 1, 3, 16, maybe 17, and 22. A lot of these "scandals" involve other people and have little or nothing to do with Obama, and are nothing more than lame attempts to drag his name through the mud. This is why I don't watch Fox News. They take events like these and instead of properly doing investigative journalism to report the facts they instead misconstrue the situation and present it to the public through an anti-Obama lens, making everything his fault regardless of whether he's involved or not. 

---

1. IRS targets Obama’s enemies - This is definitely a big scandal and legitimately worthy of criticism from both liberals and conservatives. It's possible Obama was unaware it was happening but someone in his administration must have given these orders. Sadly, we'll probably never find out who.

2. Benghazi - Honestly, Benghazi is not nearly as big a scandal as Fox News makes it out to be. Blaming the Obama administration for failing to keep American's safe during a terrorist attack is no different than accusing Bush of failing to keep American's safe during 9/11, and if that sounds silly it's because it is! Both events had warning signs that were missed, and of course hindsight is always 20/20. Benghazi is nothing more than Republican establishment trying to drag Obama and Hillary's name through the mud. It works on those who watch Fox News, but everyone else can see this for what it really is: a smear campaign. 

3. Watching the AP - This ties in directly with the NSA spying program. It's wrong. The government should not have the right to log people's calls or spy on them in such a manner without a warrant. It blows my mind there are so many conservatives preaching against "big government" but support the NSA's actions and so many privacy-loving liberals too! The program and laws that were used to justify spying on AP journalists were actually instituted under Bush W. That doesn't make the Obama administration's actions any less atrocious, but it's worth mentioning that both parties are guilty here.

4. Potential Holder perjury I - Eric Holder was the one lying here. I don't see how this is Obama's fault at all. This scandal doesn't involve him in the slightest.

5. The ATF “Fast and Furious” scheme - This one is really fucked up. The ATF and CIA giving weapons to one Mexican drug cartel in order to take out the others is not only illegal, but incredibly stupid. It's almost as though they want to make the problem worse. I don't know how much Obama has to do with this, but if he's aware and has the authority to stop it then he damn well should.

4. Rosengate - James Rosen reported classified information on air. That's illegal. It's definitely a scandal, but there's no way Obama is in the wrong here.

7. Potential Holder Perjury II - Eric Holder lied to congress. It's his scandal, not Obama's.

8. Sebelius demands payment - There is a definite conflict of interest here. Kathleen Sebelius should not be taking money from those she's responsible for regulating. With that said, Obama likely had nothing to do with it. The President can't control the actions of every single person.

9. The Pigford scandal - A well intentioned welfare program became bloated and abused by those seeking financial aid from the government. Shocker. It happens under every administration. It sucks, but I don't see how this constitutes lying by Obama.

10. GSA gone wild - The GSA wasted a bunch of taxpayer money and Obama forced the administrator to resign. Again, I don't see how Obama is at fault here. He did the right thing.

11. Veterans Affairs in Disney World - Again. Wasted money. The secretary responsible was fired and the situation was dealt with properly. The scandal here is the fault of the VA, not Obama.

12. Sebelius violates the Hatch Act - Kathleen Sebelius is responsible for this scandal. Not Obama. Ugh.

13. Solyndra - The Obama administration gave funding to plenty of companies in an attempt to boost the green energy sector. Many of those companies (like Tesla) succeeded. Some, like Solyndra did not. Also, there's no proof to suggest Obama or his administration knew the company was headed for bankruptcy. That's just something Fox News made up. With that said, promoting green energy is the right thing to do and we shouldn't fault any administration (Democratic or Republican) for doing so.

14. AKA Lisa Jackson - She used a fake name in some e-mails. How is this Obama's scandal, exactly? 

15. The New Black Panthers - Is this really a scandal? I couldn't find any information on it. It's entirely possible the Justice Department took at look at what happened and decided it wasn't worth pursuing. Just because sensationalist media headlines suggest something happened doesn't mean it actually did. 

16. Waging war all by myself - Obama ordered airstrikes on both Syria and Libya without seeking congressional or UN approval. I see this as a legitimate scandal worthy of criticism.

17. Biden bullies the press - So Biden asked a reporter to delete some photos and withhold sensitive information and it's Obama's fault?

18. AKPD not A-OK - The Obama administration paid a media firm to help promote Obamacare, and some of that money went to David Axelrod. There might be a legitimate scandal here, and it's probably worth digging a little further.

19. Sestak, we’ll take care of you - Offering someone a job so they don't screw over your political ambitions is common practice in Washington. There's no scandal here. It might be kinda shady political gamesmanship but it's not illegal by any means.

20. I’ll pass my own laws - This one is just nonsense. They're basically criticising Obama for "making his own laws" then not deporting a bunch of illegals when it's not even his job to do so. 

21. The hacking of Sharyl Attkisson’s computer - There's no evidence to suggest the Obama administration was even involved. Nothing. Just because there's supposedly a "motive and a means" doesn't mean they're guilty. Innocent until proven guilty, remember?

22. An American Political Prisoner - Arresting someone for creating an anti-Muslim video is just stupid. What happened to freedom of speech? So yeah... I'd say the timing of his arrest was suspicious and this is a legitimate scandal.

23. Get rid of inconvenient IGs - The White House sacked Gerald Walpin for being "incompetent", but the fact he was investigating one of Obama's friends is suspicious. There's no smoking gun here but it does seem shady.

24. Influence peddling - Alejandro Mayorkas "may have" used his position to grant visas for investors in a company run by Hillary's brother. If true, this is Mayorkas' scandal, and not Obama's. 




Republicans, please get your hands off the national knee.
here's the fact:  when I was growing up (a long time ago) virtually all Republicans stood for everything the Tea Part is today.  to be Republican was to be conservative

what has changed is the posture and policies of establishment Republicans, not core Republican values.  establishment Republican behavior might as well be called Dem-lite because it is
Voted for McCain and Romney so far. I was a huge Romney guy since I first heard of him. Now, I'm not so excited about the field. In a preliminary sense, I like Rubio and Paul. I did vow to myself if they propose some goddamn gay marriage amendment or say anything clearly islamophobic, I will not vote for them. Goes for both dems and repubs. 
That doesn't explain anything about how he wouldn't win in a general election. 

Look, you want someone to appeal the shit out of the party base? Fine. But that guy won't win the general election. Romney was great. He didn't win because the republicans tore him apart, he said too many things to win the primaries, and he lost handedly when going up in the general election as a result. 
I mean it's a futile effort, but everyone who voted for the invasion proved they don't have this country's best interests at heart. Bernie Sanders voted against it, which is another reason i like him.
I don't remember the specific laws anymore, but he broke quite a few UN resolutions. In reality this will never happen and the UN can't enforce its policies, but whatever. I just don't like Bush (Jr.). His dad was okay, at least from what i've studied.
Recessions happen in conservative economic situations too, Look at the US in 2008. Eastern Europe was drug down by a command economy, not a liberal capitalist one. Look at eastern Asian countries for example, Japan, South Korea, etc. These countries modernized and became world economic powers using government control almost overnight .I wouldn't argue that conservative or liberal economics are inherently better, but that each works in different contexts. I think there are plenty examples of both succeeding and failing. Neither is perfect. I honestly wouldn't care about gov't involvement in markets if there was a strong enough welfare state to keep working people out of poverty. Instead of raising taxes to fund this program, we'd close all the bureaucratic programs and replace them with a new more efficient one, like a reverse income tax. Close corporate tax loop holes and cut military spending in areas that are no longer necessary (e.g. we do not need to maintain 90% of our currently nuclear arsenal, so we could disassemble many of our nukes and use the fissile material in nuclear reactors).
Very true.
Except most hispanics won't vote Republican, because of the way a lot of the party has acted in recent years, at least not anytime soon.
Romney's not bad, I hear he has binders full of women!
I smiled this morning as FOX was talking about debate preparation, e.g. Jebster is holed up in some hotel room practicing with people role playing Cruz and Trump

Trump is off to Scotland (back today) and is not preparing :-)

shows that career establishment politicians have to prepare because they have no basis to answer what they really think, what they actually feel and would do
Recession happen, yes. As any economy experiences ups and downs. But the recession in the U.S. was caused by a bubble bursting, and that bubble was directly caused by liberal economic policies such as the CRA, the DREAM Act, and the creation of the FHA. In fact, the Bush Administration tried to roll back elements of the CRA, and the Democrats and Bernie Sanders filibustered that effort in 2005.

The fact is that liberal economic policy is far too simplistic to work in the real world. You cite a strong welfare network, which would be nice, but don't follow that through to figuring out how to pay for it. You say we should raise corporate taxes (by closing loopholes) but ignore the fact that the U.S. already has the highest corporate taxes in the world, and that those high taxes are driving business over seas. 

You cite Japan and South Korea, ignoring that they are the most conservatively economic countries in the region. But countries have one very important thing in common: they were both occupied by the United States in the last century. And because they were occupied, they have copied the American capitalist model. China and India have only seen dramatic economic growth after throwing off the left-wing policies that kept them down, and allowing for foreign investment and conservative monetary policy.

Or look at the Scandinavian nations now. Through the recession, Denmark and Finland have held tightly to their liberal economic policy, and have suffered for it. Their GDP is weak and, at times, actually shrinking. However, Norway and Sweden have privatized, lifted restrictions on investment, cut taxes, and seen their GDPs grow at a much healthier rate as a result.

There is no context where liberal economic policy works better than conservative. In any context where a nation is trying to maximize growth, provide a better quality of life for its citizens, and encourage investment and development, conservative economic policy relying on low taxes, low regulation, and free markets is demonstrably superior.
You make an convincing argument. 


my TRUMP T-shirt arrived today :-)

btw, heard this afternoon that Jebster is very concerned about global warming and says needs action now.  so Jebster's pro Common Core, pro open or very loose borders, won't commit to not raising taxes.  with a candidate like that, Jebster could comfortably run as a democrat 
Trump cares about trump.
Jindal is a joke. Don't know anything about Carla
Wish huntsman was running.
Or as an American. Having opinions that are in line with the majority of Americans doesn't make someone a Democrat.
you sound like someone dying to vote for Hillary
Or trump is so egotistical that he has the naive confidence to run into a debate without preparation. Or maybe he doesn't give a shit about the stupid stuff he says because apparently it gets him ahead in the polls. 
[deleted]
&gt; confidence to run into a debate without preparation

debates run by libtards are all about "gotcha" questions that yield propaganda sound bites...but this one hopefully will be all about substantive matters.  what's to prepare?
Rubio at this point. I agree with with most of his views. 
What about his views on global warming and the Middle East?
vastly enhances Romney's image
thats because the abortion video isn't news. its a craftily edited hit piece. in almost every case where they air a clip it was followed by something which puts it in perspective... example. the part where she the doctor says "hey if you can make a little extra..." which is followed by her saying "thats what some non profits might do but we don't do that." in other words, contradicting the narrative created by the carefully edited snippet.

;tldr one story is news the other is a non-story because its completely fabricated
Because he's never won an election or held a position in the Republican party. Is he any more a notable Republican than say Sean Hannity?

But his [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/) should probably be added to the list.
he's the talk of the nation because of what **he's** talking about

people are hearing positions, attitudes, policies career politicians do not speak

the Founding Fathers anticipated office holders to be those willing and able the sacrifice to serve.  leaving business and family to serve the nation then **go back home**

Trump does not not need a new job.  Americans see that Trump is sincere in cleaning up the disaster Obama has created, restoring jobs, being tough again internationally...the list goes on and on

professional career and establishment politicians do not put America first.  Trump would.  America wants (and desperately needs) a no bullshit warrior like Trump

also in the mix is getting things done.  as a mega executive with thousands of employees, Trump is a super star at picking other super stars to act as managers.  in a Trump administration, good things for America will flow like a fast river
The fact that trump is leading the Republican polls, but trailing in the matchups tells me that one of the following is happening:

1) The polls are being successfully loaded in Trump's favor
2) There is a significant number of people willing to vote Republican, but not for Trump.

I am not sure, but I think the Republican Primary polls are limited to Republican voters, but the matchups are not. 

If neither are limited, the polls make no sense

Not a Trump fan, but this is pretty good stuff.
lemons into lemonade.  Trump b da man
I read that its not considered a debate. 
You mean like Lindsay Graham did when Trump did it to him. Wow.

Yes, let's all praise this buffoon for being so original. 


God help us all. You idiots will hold hands with Hilary towards 2016 if you continue to support Trump.

Did any of you actually believe Trump will win a general election? Do any of you believe that Trump will make people think conservatives aren't 100% arrogant retards? 
Trump's rise is entirely the GOP's fault. Did you see Jeb Bush apologize over that "women's healthcare" comment? Planned Parenthood and the left went on offense when they were uncovered to be harvesting and selling body parts and not at cost. They don't apologize when they're wrong, Jeb Bush said nothing wrong and *he* apologized. I love Romney but he was guilty of this shit as well. 


Trump is not nearly as bad as people think he is. He's not a stellar candidate and person in almost every way like Romney was. There are 17 candidates and not one who comes close to being as good of a candidate as Romney was. And he lost! 

Trump appeals to those who do not want politicians bought and paid for, and to those who are sick and tired of both sides not doing anything about illegal immigration. Trump is right when he says our leaders are horrible negotiators. We hold all the best cards and the other side gets the better of us time and time again! Whether you like Trump or not, you can't deny that he has a demonstrable history of getting the better end of deals even when negotiating from a position of weakness. 

My point is, although everyone wants a "straight shooter". The straight shooter will never win the general election and we will end up with another 8 years of democrat control.

Sometimes you need a great mediator that brings together the parties while still striving for the principles they hold. They don't need to compromise on their beliefs, but they don't need to be a firebrand insulting anyone that doesn't agree with them.
The GOP is unlikely to win with anyone this time around. Trump does better with Latinos than other GOP candidates.
Trump does better right this very second with specific latino GOP voters. Not the nation as a whole.

I hope he puts his name in, but later on in the race. If he joins in now he'll sky rocket in the polls and everybody on both sides will hammer him. Why get beat up for a year when he could wait and get the same popularity.
He doesn't need their support right now. We saw an unprecedented swing in the favorability ratings for Trump among conservatives in the past few months. He just might be able to do it again for the general election! I don't think Trump would bother doing that til at least the first 4 primaries are out of the way. 
I would honestly be willing to bet my life savings that Trump would be destroyed in the general. I just can't see why you would think he would do well. He is the laughing stock of most americans. 
I don't care if he does well in the general election. This is the worst crop of GOP candidates we've had in a while. Either way, with the map looking the way it does the Democrat (likely Hillary Clinton) will be the odds-on favorite to win unless they do something moronic like nominate Bernie Sanders. Our establishment-picked frontrunner had the chance to go on the offensive against people who try to get top dollar for the body parts of aborted fetuses, but apologized instead! If he can't stand up against the enemy within how can we trust him to negotiate a favorable deal with the rest of the world's leaders? Just based on what we saw over this Planned Parenthood stuff I'd trust Hillary to get a favorable deal for us before I'd trust Jeb. And after Jeb who exactly is there? It's a crop of unseasoned rookies and losers. 
So let me get this straight.

You support Trump over Jeb, Marco, Walker, Paul, Kasich, etc.

Even though Trump donated to the Clinton foundation. Supported Partial birth abortion. Still has meaning liberal leanings he is still hiding currently.

You'd also rather have President Hilary than Jeb.

Have you done your research on what Trump actually stands for and donates to?

Or is the ONLY reason you are supporting this man is because he has a loud mouth. What has he actually DONE to show anything?
Jeb really disappointed me on the Planned Parenthood apology. I would only vote for him in the general election.

Marco is very talented, but doesn't seem to be a "smartest man in the room" type which is what I prefer. Give him more experience and he'd make an excellent President. His backup plan to run for the Governor of Florida and *then* get elected President is the path I'd prefer him to take. But he's OK. 

Walker is unelectable. Dopey look, no college degree. He cut out mass transportation from the transportation budget and instead used state funds to build excessively lavish highway improvements. He's been fiscally irresponsible and is leaving behind a mess for his successor. 

Paul is a clown. I will never support a member of the Paul family. Of course, he's a rookie Senator with no relevant experience at all prior to being a Senator. He is his father's son and would be a dangerous nut particularly on foreign policy. Worse than Obama. 

Kasich seems OK. He won't come close to the nomination. He's more of a VP candidate. 

I know that Trump not a conservative. I don't care! He's accomplished quite a lot in his life. LOL. 
I would disagree with the Marco is not the smartest man in the room type. 

I'm not entirely sure why you think Paul is a clown but Trump isn't a clown. 

How can someone's apology disappoint you but when someone supports something just as awful if not more awful than what Planned Parenthood does you're ok with it.

And Trump was born into lavish wealth. It was his father's business he has bankrupted multiple businesses.

I encourage you to watch this video. Why would you ever want this man leading your country?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8misIB15KE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=35s
When I read what he did I couldn't help but think this.
http://i.imgur.com/EJiOWqO.png
Romney and Cruz are some examples of the "smartest man in the room" types. Same goes for Richard Nixon, even Trump. Not Rubio, but he's OK. Dubya was bright but not the "smartest man in the room" either. It's not a deal breaker. 

Trump is a clown. A very entertaining clown. The difference between the Trump clown show and the Paul clown show is that Trump does it intentionally. Rand Paul is just a nut. 

You're failing to understand the argument. Based on this whole Planned Parenthood thing it's fairly safe to say that Hillary Clinton will fight for American interests better than Jeb would. She's got much bigger balls than Jeb. What use is having someone who agrees with me in the White House if he hasn't got the balls to fight for these things? 

Trump came back from $300 million in the hole to be worth close to $10 billion. Most people born into wealth don't do much in life. Many blow their family's money! Donald Trump makes his father Fred look like a small time businessman in comparison. Trump's adult kids all seem to have turned out pretty well. This reflects well on the parents. Mitt Romney is another one born into wealth who didn't turn out to be some loser. 

Trump winning the presidency is unlikely. A lot of the stuff he says publicly is part of his professional celebrity/troll act. He's really a great manager and negotiator. 
who says/said Latinos are anti-American?  Trump is

I never believed they were outside the main stream
Damn. Now what will the other republican establishment hopefuls do to play him off as racist? 
Latino Republicans don't matter. What does matter is the general election. In a general election, Hispanics don't like Trump. That is a problem because many people suggest that you need 35% or more of the Latino vote.

http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/karl-rove-hispanics-gop/2013/06/27/id/512244/

Trump will not do well with Latinos in the General Election.
http://fusion.net/story/167578/univision-poll-latino-voters-trump/



This is something Ron Paul was never able to do in all his years in Congress. This isn't the first bill Cruz has gotten passed, just the first in this session. 
If they sympathize with illegals then he doesn't need them! Enough is enough! 
The problem is that the Republican Party needs 35% or more of the Latino vote to win the White House. They are not going to get it with Trump in a general election.

Remember that Mitt Romney said, "Hispanic can self deport." and many say that statement cost him the election because he got about 27% of the Latino vote. 

Trump means automatic loss.
[Winning Hispanic vote would not be enough for GOP](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-winning-hispanic-vote-would-not-be-enough-for-gop/article/2528730)

&gt;FTA:What if Romney had won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, the high-water mark for Republicans achieved by George W. Bush in 2004? As it turns out, if Romney had hit that Bush mark, he still would have lost, with 240 electoral votes to 298 for Obama.

&gt;But what if Romney had been able to make history and attract 50 percent of Hispanic voters? What then? He still would have been beaten, 283 electoral votes to 255.

&gt;What if Romney had been able to do something absolutely astonishing for a Republican and win 60 percent of the Hispanic vote? He would have lost by the same margin, 283 electoral votes to 255.

&gt;But what if Romney had been able to reach a mind-blowing 70 percent of the Hispanic vote? Surely that would have meant victory, right? No, it wouldn't. Romney still would have lost, although by the narrowest of electoral margins, 270 to 268. (Under that scenario, Romney would have won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College; he could have racked up huge numbers of Hispanic votes in California, New York and Texas, for example, and not changed the results in those states.)

Romney was right about "self-deportation", and he was a pretty good but not perfect candidate (no one is). The current crop of GOP candidates is the worst we've seen in a while. I'm OK to give Trump a go at this one especially after Jeb Bush apologized over his Planned Parenthood comments.  The establishment could learn a lot from the way Trump handles things, believe it or not. 
History repeats itself. A rich white guys who insults Hispanics. We tried that already with Mitt Romney. It's time for a change. 
This is change. Trump is very different. If Mitt Romney was a little more like Trump he would have won. Romney didn't insult Hispanics, neither did Trump. It's not helpful when you use the dishonest talking points of the left. 
Hispanic here: Trump and Romney both insulted hispanics. Romney was not as insulting, and picking up Rubio sorta amended him in my eyes. Trump is just an ignorant fool, who says the most outlandish things because he wants that attention. So if that's the change you want for politics, then vote for him. 

Edit: I just want to make it clear that I am a republican, and back most of the party's ideologies on immigration ("most" being the important word here).
Lmao this is hilarious crap
Husband of a legal immigrant from a former Spanish colony here. Trump insulted **illegal** immigrants. For such an ignorant fool his campaign roll out has been pretty successful. I guess it was an accident, just like his success in the business world. 
Don't get me wrong, I'd be for deporting all the illegal residents in this country if it was feasible. But building a wall? And claiming we'd make the Mexican government do it? No thanks. Sorry if that angers me, since my mother is a legal immigrant from that country. The solution is not to close off the border, but to fix our current immigration policies that make it difficult for people to come and try to achieve this "American Dream" that we boast. We also have to take a stronger stance at punishing businesses that hire illegal immigrants, and not allow them to think that's a feasible way of maintaining a work-force. If there's one thing our political system doesn't need more of, its absurd, ignorant hyperboles. And that's all Trump is. 
We need to do whatever is necessary to secure our homeland and to stop the flood of illegals. The USA holds all the cards. If we were determined to we could get the Mexicans to pay for it. Without free trade with and proximity to the US they'd probably be as poor as the Philippines!

Again...how is this not insulting?
I don't see it as insulting. It's not an attack on the people of Mexico at all. 
Its not though. Illegal immigrants don't "threaten the homeland." This argument is full of logical fallacies (false cause, slippery slope) and it is insulting that you claim a nation needs to be cut off and isolated because of something a minority of its population has done, which really isn't that bad. "Oh no, these people want better lives for themselves? Let's not give them that opportunity! Cut them off!"
**Bullshit!!!!** Tell that to the families of people murdered by illegals! Drugs, violent criminals, disease, and uneducated desperate people flow across that border and also on rafts from Mexico and other countries like Haiti.

Mexico is the country where the largest number of those who violate our immigration laws cross over from. Mexico benefits from favorable relations with us. We benefit as well, but they need us more than we need them. If Mexico wants to continue to have favorable relations with us they can put a stop to this massive flow of illegal immigrants. 
People would get murdered and do drugs regardless! This is the "false cause" of your argument. Not every illegal comes over here and is looking for how much cocaine they can sell. 
I'm sure the families of the folks who were murdered because criminals from countries like Haiti and Mexico were able to come here and stay so easily will find that comforting. "People would get murdered regardless". What a dumb thing to say! I never said or suggested that every illegal immigrant comes here to sell cocaine! 
But to generalize the actions/morals of a populous is just as dumb. 
You are twisting my words in order to build a straw man. 

Tell me, do you actually think that Mexico sends their "best"? Trump says that Mexico doesn't send their best. I agree with him. The income and crime statistics  support this! 

Other countries, such as the one my wife came from, do not have an open border with us so their slums don't empty out into our country. We do get many of their "best" since relatively few people from her country come here in violation of our immigration laws. These legal immigrants are often selected for their skills and even when they come here for other reasons such as being sponsored by a family member they are still subjected to fees, interviews, documentation of up to date medical shots and records, etc. 
It's not dishonest talking points of the left.

Do you watch Latin TV at all? I do. I watch Univision and Telemundo. I have watched in Spanish Latinos bash Donald Trump. They don't bash anyone else from what I see. Trump is done.
No habla espanol. Just because Univision and Telemundo say something doesn't mean it's true! The GOP would have lost in 2012 even with 70% of the Hispanic vote. Trump is currently polling the most favorably among Latino conservatives. I don't think they'd like Trump so much if he was insulting them. 
Here are Hispanics protesting Trump. No other candidates gets this much hate. The Latino interviewed says he insulted all Hispanics. Not just Mexicans.

There are better candidates that does not have these much negatives.
The escaped drug lord El Chapo also doesn't like Trump. So what? Trump also has the most support from Hispanics of any Republican! If the Republicans can't win certain people's votes because the candidate is too firmly against illegal immigration then the GOP doesn't need those votes! Enough is enough! 

Besides, this is a really poor GOP field. I'm OK to give Trump a go. It at least sends a message to the GOP establishment. A lesson that they are trying very hard to not learn! They'd rather throw 1/3 of the GOP primary electorate under the bus then accept the reasons why so many people are currently supporting Trump for president! 
[deleted]
Great. So while we send a message to the GOP, the Democrats get the White House.
So be it. It doesn't ruin my life. I'd prefer to see Hillary Clinton negotiating against Putin and the rest of the world's bad actors over Jeb Bush.  

Illegal immigration needs to stop and at least one (ideally both) political party must be against it. Perhaps the children who refuse to support a strong anti-illegal immigration candidate will come around someday. Perhaps they won't. 
Just trying this out.  Not exactly the best means of doing something like this, but thought it might be interesting.
obviously vastly helping

all-time record TV viewership of 17 Republican candidates

for sure, because of Trump on stage
Do you really think they send their worst? Because that's exactly what Trump said. I never said they send their best, because they aren't sending anyone. It's hysterical bullshit, and you're the one twisting my words. 
/facepalm why can't republicans figure out that most new generation republicans truly don't give a shit about these types of things. These are laws that should be state regulated the federal government needs to gtfo of our business 
We get their worst. I can tell you that when it comes to the worst countries don't always take them back willingly. There is an example in my area where a guy was put away in the mid-90s for attempted murder, then a few years ago his sentence was up and he was turned over to ICE. Haiti would not take this guy back! Based on whatever metrics ICE had they determined there was not enough evidence that this guy would be a risk to the public. He killed a girl months later. Now there's one less American alive and the rest of the taxpayers will have to pay for this guy's prison sentence for however many years to come. This stuff happens all the time!
He's crossed a line now. I don't forgive a Republican who insults Megyn Kelly. 
whatever he did, Trump did it braving machine gun fire and bombs
what?  she was a blonde hit man...poorly disguised

clearly an agenda to damage Trump rather than inform Americans on issues
This Haitian example does you a lot of good when talking about Mexico. 
There's more Haitians than Mexicans in my area. You don't think that Mexico ever does the same thing? The Mexican government isn't stupid. 


http://www.theday.com/policefirecourts/20150801/mother-of-norwich-murder-victim-working-with-attorney-on-deportation-policy-

I don't understand this attitude.  Part of the role of Thursday night is to test the candidates.  Trump clearly showed he isn't up to the task if he can't take heat from Megyn Kelly.  As the top candidate I'd expect him to get pushed the most - cream rises to the top.  How's he going to react when pressed by Merkel or Putin?
[deleted]
test what?  nothing having to do with the job of President or the welfare of America, or it's direction, or what needs to be done fix it

the crap will come later for sure from the libtard media.  concerned Americans watching the debate wanted/expected/deserved **substance** not some shit ass National Enquirer tabloid "question" agenda.  did you hear [Levin's outrage](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/08/audio-mark-levin-rips-megyn-kelly-trump-gotcha-question/) over what you are defending?
It will come later, so I'd rather get it out of the way now before we choose one candidate and have these issues come out in late 16.  Can you imagine if this were a presidential debate and Trump made those comments about Hilary?  What chance he had of making a dent in the women voters would be thrown out the window.

And do we really have concerned Americans watching to see the tough issues?  The vast majority of the watchers were people who are not going to be labeled as independent or swing voters in the election.  That's the problem with the primary.  You're fighting for the vote of people who are never going to vote for the other side.  

This was never intended to be a debate about who is going to be the best president.  If you thought it should be, I'm sorry.  This is about finding out who is the best candidate to put up against whoever the Democratic nominee is.  



&gt; This was never intended to be a debate about who is going to be the best president

This cream puff can't even control his own event. How can anyone expect him to be worthy of the office of President of the United States?


[deleted]
The president's speeches are very important. Diplomacy is perhaps the most important job of the president. Both internationally and domestically. Insulting women (or men but Trump clearly is more derogatory towards women) is a terrible way to do diplomacy. 

So how is that not a fair question?
What does it matter if Trump is right about every single issue but because he treats people horribly he can't achieve a single thing as president?
That's not entirely fair. I'm from Seattle, and it wasn't actually his event, just an event celebrating Medicaid and Social Security that he was invited to speak at since he was in town for his real campaign even later in the evening.
what's your evidence?
I'm pulling for Bernie.  he's doing well disrupting Hillbag
Trump will continue to do well.  But regardless, there is indeed a certain amount of decorum that a president must hold in public.  I don't think he intended his words here to be about her period, but who knows with Trump.  A president has to be just a little bit more intellectual than this.

What concerns me (and it should with anyone)... are we going to have a president who is going to be constantly held in check by Congress, censured, or even impeached as his actions and words are so far out of line that not only does nothing get done, but he manages to alienate the country and the world.

Trump can set up a cabinet, even pick a supreme court justice.  But he can't pick Congress.  And as it stands, neither side likes him very much.  Realistically, Trump would cause major government gridlock... worse than anything ever seen before.  The man has no self control.

I was actually in favor of Trump.  I think everyone loves his message.  People are angry.  But you disrespect the voters of, say, Kentucky, when you call their elected representative a "loser" or a "lightweight".  

And sadly, Trump might actually have the business sense to do some good.  But don't believe all the noise about "I don't need lobbyists, I'm rich" propaganda.  Trump is *his own* lobbyist.  He doesn't care about anything more than he cares about his own real estate empire. This presidential run is just something to do because he's bored.

If you like Trump, then I would suggest just focusing on his message and find someone who shares that sentiment in earnest.  Someone who isn't so deep in the realm of politics and understands what people are going through. Someone who can be bold without alienating the very people he/she needs to be able to work with.

Again, I think Trump will continue to do well.  People love to watch a train wreck.  But I think the show needs to end so that we can get serious.  Angry as we may be, a temper tantrum doesn't fix anything. 
What's my evidence that if he doesn't get along with the opposition he can't accomplish anything? You really need evidence that treating others like crap means they won't work with you?

Evidence: Obama and the Republican Congress. Imagine if Obama treated them even worse!
Dems have been treating their opposition (Republicans) worse than crap for decades...what's the point?  be nice hoping they'll be nice?  it's proven by the record "nice" does not have a home in politics 
I got Ted Cruz . And that's fine.I do like Trump.
Both Bushes and Reagan treated the opposition nicely and with respect; while forcefully disagreeing with them. And all three were able to accomplish a great deal even with opposition controlled Congresses.  Treating people with respect goes a long way.
Santorum, Bush then Trump for me all within 3% of each other. 
&gt; Bush and Reagan

true, but the left never stops being offensive.  it's in their play book, yet never gets denounced by the media.  I guess we're so used to liberal outrages, being repulsive is expected and pre approved
Meh. Don't be a baby. Republicans are just as offensive. Fox News alone is a constant stream of very negative things said about Democrats. 

But this isn't about saying nice things. It's not about calling opposition stupid or socialists or whatever. It's about insulting, only women, for their appearance because of a disagreement that had nothing to do with their appearance.

Megyn Kelly asked what should have been a softball question. Trump should have responded that he got emotional and overreacted or something like that. Something to show that he was a statesman now rather than a bully or simply an excitable person. Instead he double downed on it and accused Megyn of asking the question because she was on her period. 
I got 95% rand paul.

Rubio will make for an excellent "fall back" choice after Trump. I'm still hoping for Romney to get back into the race.

Even if Rubio loses in 2016 look for him to run for and win the FL Govenor job. This will position him as the likely frontrunner in a future Presidential election.

&gt; For ~~many~~ SOME Americans, the Trump presidential campaign amounts to a billionaire talking endlessly, and entertainingly, on television. 
Rubio must know he's out of the race, but the FL Governor notion I think was there all along
And it only took them 45 years.
USA doesn't need to send *spies* into China to incite rebellious uprisings with opposition leaders. Meddling in such a way would be seen as an act of aggression and is a quick way to damage the positive relations that have been built up between the two countries over the last few decades.  Its also a sure fire way to encourage China to build up their military capacity and align themselves even closer to Russia.
  
Best to just passively keep the culture war going. The younger generation of Chinese are already becoming more Westernized in their ideals and lifestyles through Hollywood movies and tv. We are seeing a huge shift towards materialization (*capitalism*), an increase in the middle class, and a stronger desire amongst these people for more freedoms as their education increases.  
  
Thats the best way to *convert* China as it won't lead to the possibility of hostility on either side. There are some nations worth intimidating through military force and internal unrest like North Korea or Iran, but China with its 1.4B people and large economy is not one of them.  
  
And I hope Rubio leaves Cuba alone. Dude needs to drop his grudge. Sanctions down there didn't work.
Marco Rubio's resume:

UF bachelor degree 1993

UM Law degree 1996

First elected to office 1998

Marco spent a whole 2 years in the private sector as a lawyer.  That is his total non-political career.  Much of which was spent campaigning for office.

He has zero real world experience.

Why does this matter?

2008 attacks on obama focused on his lack of real world experience.  Just as a community organizer.





FTA:

&gt;Where Nevada was once a feverous stronghold for Paul’s father, whose supporters ran an aggressive ground game that suspended the caucus in 2008 and overran the delegate selection process in 2012, this year the Pauls are no longer a “lone voice in the wilderness,” said Jericha Deaux, political director for the Clark County Republican Party. “I’ve seen a huge off-shot of Rand supporters who have left him for Donald Trump.”

I don't disagree with you on the facts, but it's worth noting that Barack Obama still won 2 terms as president despite his lack of "real-world experience".

88% tie between Clinton and Sanders. Not surprising- I prefer Sanders but I'm for either candidate so long as the right wing doesn't have a chance to destroy the country again.
You are using the wrong percentages. You are ignoring the baserates by region of illegal immigrants and reporting the breakout of affected immigrants. The 2% of Europeans that make up the total amount that would receive amnesty could be 90% of total European illegals. The 68% of Mexicans you quote could be 30% of total illegal Mexicans...

FYI, you are posting in /r/republicans ;)

(My opinion is moot, since I can't vote in a foreign country anyways.)
At this point, I'm still up in the air. But I like Rubio, Paul, Fiorina, and Bush. My big hold up on Fiorina is that she's never held elected office, so I think she would make a really solid VP with an option to run in eight years. Also, I wasn't a huge fan of Jeb Bush's until the debates, when he kind of won me over by having all the right answers. 
i c the Paul gang members here on reddit are still trying
essential?  of course not.  but the Brits are entitled to carrying on history
Not a registered republican, but Kasich seems the most capable.
Oh, I'm very aware haha ;)
Great pick. Ran HP into the ground while outsourcing/offshoring tens of thousands. Can only imagine what she got planned for the US.
How does this in any way have to do with American politics or Republicans?
Because those who have opinions now don't really care about winning in the general. They would rather lose with purity than win with compromise. Once things calm down they will most likely fall in line for the most part but for now it's a short sighted temptation to support the "pure" candidates.
Rubio. I am starting to warm to Trump though. 
Nobody wants jeb.
Because Trump attracts people like me who have never voted for a Republican in my entire life (locally) and voted once for president.  If Trump gets the nomination he has my vote.  If the GOP puts Jeb, Walker or Rubio as their guy I won't be voting for them.  

 
Bush. I can still be persuaded otherwise.

by your text, you have only a cursory knowledge of the three candidates you mention, e.g. Carson = surgeon, Walker almost impeached, and you are overwhelmed by Trump's resonance with the American people

you need many lessons, but here's one big one:

the Founding Fathers envisioned public service from office holders.  their meaning was men who would sacrifice their business/income, their wives and children, friends and comforts of home to go **serve** then **go home**

you somehow think that what is best is a professional, career politician, but just look where that has taken America.  Carson, Trump and Fiorina are drawing excitement precisely because they are not beltway drones catering to the establishment and insider politics

the American people are, and have been, **FED UP** with politics as usual and want a return to stability, normalcy and the rule of law (The Constitution).  the people gave Republicans a solid victory in 2012 congressional and gubernatorial shifts.  the Republicans claimed they were still unable to un-do Obama because of the Senate in Harry Reid's power, so in 2014 Republicans were given the Senate, more House seats and even more governors

Result:  **Nothing**.  the people were betrayed by professional politicians (Republicans) who all ran on stuff like repealing Obamacare but did not.  worse, they fully funded Obamacare ongoing

these are the jerks (Republican establishment professional politicians) that must go...because we now have unassailable **proof** the establishment can not be trusted

your on the street hard-working American feels and pays for all that.  they want out!  they want an alternative and Trump, Carson are such people, e.g. as of a few days ago, 57% of registered Republicans said they will/would vote for Trump

Trump is the **ONLY** candidate to stick it to the establishment, stick it political correctness, stick it to the lame stream media and **America is cheering**  for more

btw, "I remember he almost got impeached" is so naive about the Walker story, it deserves no ink to respond to you
Because Trump is a refreshing departure from the same BS we've been hearing..OVER...and OVER and OVER...not ONE WORD can be trusted to be truth out of ANY of the career politicians mouths.  They keep promising the same things over and over and keep trolling us over and over.  It's time to send a message.
&gt; he Founding Fathers envisioned public service from office holders. their meaning was men who would sacrifice their business/income, their wives and children, friends and comforts of home to go serve then go home

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; you somehow think that what is best is a professional, career politician, but just look where that has taken America. Carson, Trump and Fiorina are drawing excitement precisely because they are not beltway drones catering to the establishment and insider politics

I'm well aware of this. To me, this is one of those ideas that gets dumbed down. Very much like the sentiments of 'plain spoken' or 'I wanna have a beer with him' or even that being a leader isn't about having ability. 

It's true that leadership is not about knowing everything about every detail, no one can. It's about being able to recognize talent, inspiring the best out of them, knowing when to put your ego aside and listen, etc. But what happened is we perverted that into making ignorance a plus, and gave every candidate who was clearly incompetent a way to sell their inability. 

Similarly, yes, career politicians were not the original intention, but the perversion of that into, "He has no expertise and is completely ignorant of the complexities of Government, what a plus!" is just silly. Running this country is a hell of an undertaking. You need a serious person to do it.

&gt; the American people are, and have been, FED UP with politics as usual and want a return to stability, normalcy and the rule of law (The Constitution).

Well, consider me similarly fed up, but again it's kind of a naive folksy thing to me to take it where you're going. Yeah, Politicians are full of it a lot, and if we keep buying into it we'll end up in the same place. I wrote a [if I were on stage](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3g4hif/republicans_debated_in_ohio_the_economy_barely/ctuvgeg) thing about economic swings recently, and that's part of what I'm talking about: Every candidate has to go out there a promise the moon, knowing full well they can't deliver. That's something that needs to be called BS on. Your boy Trump has a fantasy land plan on immigration that appeals to our lowest and most prejudiced impulses. I don't see that as positive change, I see that as more ignorance. 

&gt; Nothing. the people were betrayed by professional politicians (Republicans) who all ran on stuff like repealing Obamacare but did not. worse, they fully funded Obamacare ongoing

&gt;these are the jerks (Republican establishment professional politicians) that must go...because we now have unassailable proof the establishment can not be trusted

I see a very different narrative than you do, obviously. My take on the Republican party is this: Coming out of the Bush years, we needed to set a different path. We needed to apologize for Rove-style politics and propaganda, that put party before country and winning above everything else. Instead, we kept with the BS. We pretended it didn't quite happen like that, and went into this kind of limbo where we admit what we have to, where the poorness of the decision-making is obvious, but still cling to the BS where we can.

With Obamacare...really? The party has demonized Obamacare into the fall of society, unwilling to have a real debate about the complexities of the issue. They voted to repeal it I don't remember how many times, pointlessly, just as a political thing. What a waste of time. The idea that Republicans didn't go against Obamacare is just...again, really?

&gt; your on the street hard-working American feels and pays for all that. they want out! they want an alternative and Trump, Carson are such people

No, no they're not. That's the pipe dream. They'll just be bad at the job of being an executive. If you want better laws, you need to work on congress. As Milton Friedman once said, you can't change things just by electing the right people, you also have to make it politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right thing.

&gt; Trump is the ONLY candidate to stick it to the establishment, stick it political correctness, stick it to the lame stream media and America is cheering for more

It's kinda sad to me. Trump is an egomaniac who has no business being near the White House. And if you've ever seen him or his family, you'd realize they're just about as out of touch with the 'common man' as you could be. Remember, Trump's dad was rich, he just got richer, which isn't that hard. But based solely on the fact that he has no filter you'll go for him? He's not even consistent in between speeches on what he's for. 

And like I suggested, the nativist drivel about immigration appeals to the worst elements of our party. Immigration has been even or net negative for years. Every competent economist will tell you immigration is generally a positive (unless you provide them with too many entitlements), and they don't 'take our jobs'. Mexico sends the bad ones over? It's paranoid nonsense. Most immigrants aren't actually from Mexico anyway. Illegal immigrants are the reason crime is bad and women get raped? WTF?  And the idea that we could or should round them all up? How can you take that seriously?

I simply don't see how you can vote for someone who is THIS WRONG about something.

Here's the great irony to me: Republicans shouldn't have to resort to cheap tactics if we're *right*. And I think a lot of times we are right. If you're right, it's to your advantage to elucidate the facts. But I still don't see the party doing that, and it's very frustrating. Why don't we try being the smart ones? The ones who care about the real meat of the issues? 

It's there for the taking if we want it - we can take over pretty much the entire economic argument, and leave the Democrats with nothing but 'free college for everyone', 'kill those evil rich people', and 'shut down those polluters'! We can take over the social argument too with some Libertarian notions, instead of forcing all our candidates to go way to the right on abortion and everything else. That's the 'big tent' we want. So why not do it that way? 


&gt; Republican pollster Frank Luntz assembled a 29-person focus group

I see that scumbag Luntz, who was pounding away at Trump, has changed his tune, **completely**

his previous release had a roomful of anti Trump people and that was his conclusion..."yup, Trump's dead meat in the long run"

what an asshole
This is a slippery slope.  Some people think the 1A is out of date, since it was enacted when we only had printing presses and no Internet.  Some people think the 2A is out of date because it was enacted when we had muskets, not automatic weapons.  I'm sure some people would argue why the entire Bill of Rights is out of date.

But anyway, no, I don't think the 4A is out of date.
Seriously? You used Spanish punctuation around the name Jeb? You couldn't simply use the editorial's title? And we wonder why we struggle getting the Hispanic vote when Spanish punctuation is used as an insult.
[deleted]
I use it for ¡Jeb!, not for Rubio or Cruz. Anyone who is offended by ¡Jeb!, frankly, needs to grow up and grow some thicker skin. His signs for English-language audiences show him as being Jeb!, and we're all supposed to be impressed by his Spanish language skills, so adding the upside down exclamation point is just being helpful! 

Ever watch *Married... with Children*? They made these sorts of jokes all the time. It's all in good fun.
I'm not offended it's simply an unnecessary addition to the title. Took me a bit to figure out I hadn't accidentally gotten in /r/politics.

That's a 90s show, kid. I'm a member of the Millennial generation. 
such places have way more than just health care socialized
Social programs don't seem to scale very well.  They work great in very homogenized countries that also have  small populations, but I've never seen anything that convinces me they can be effective in a country as large and as diverse as the U.S..  The social programs the U.S. *does* have are poorly managed and extremely expensive, which only adds to my skepticism.  
incredible 
yea, but, we're electing a president, not testing purity

So no wall through the Great Lakes? 
Homogeneous countries like... Canada? Lol
Romney was a joke. He had/has absolutely no chance of winning.
Disagreeing with really dumb ideas isn't saying much. What's more interesting is how these ideas are even part of the dialogue.
He's the best candidate either side put up in decades. 
huh
Seriously? How do you expected to be taken seriously posting shit like this?
what's new about all that is that it's being talked about, exposed

Thanks again Mr. Trump, you da man
Well now, aren't you just great.  Coming all the way from the Sanders camp to post in the Republicans subs.
Times is running an endless series of scare editorials attacking Trump in the vague hope some of their shit will stick.  the stategy is in Chapter Two of their media manual for smearing Republicans ....early, often and recklessly
While I don't necessarily agree with all the points Mr. Trump is making, I do believe that he is bringing one of the most important issues to the forefront: manufacturing. Countries like China and Mexico offer companies such as Ford and Nabisco manufacturing costs so low that – if, and likely when – they do move there, our nation SHOULD impose a 30% tariff upon them. 

I argue that Mr. Trump is pulling a Ralph Nader and pushing the real issues to the forefront of this election so that the  American public will be more informed. 

On the contrary, as a first-generation Indian-American, Mr. Trump's platform in immigration holds some merit to it. There is a right way to immigrate to this country and a wrong way. While, yes, the Statue of Liberty does stand for the quote etched upon it – "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . . . " – I would argue that those who immigrate the incorrect way have ruined it for others by placing an undue burden on the taxpayer. 

I invite any contention to my points so long as it is in a civilized manner. 

EDIT: I am not saying that Mr. Trump is an altruistic man. His actions will likely reinvigorate his brand name and has already begun to revive his relevancy. However, I do contend that he is acting like Ralph Nader once did and is currently running so certain issues that other candidates are unwilling to discuss are. 
Romney you have lost twice already don't  make it  a third
I'm glad at least some of the Congressional Republicans want to move forward on this deal even if they can't carry opposition; it will give rapprochement with Iran a solid chance while de-escalating the regional arms race that seemed to be brewing.  The crisis in Yemen may still exacerbate that but a reduced Israel-Iran standoff takes the heat off a struggling Iraq caught in the middle.
Considering that Social Security is the largest and most successful social program in world history, I don't see how it can go wrong?  

Well, we could always rob all the funding from our social programs to pay for lower taxes for Donald Trump and the other 500 richest people in the country that benefit most from the Bush tax cuts. 

What most people fail to realize is that our healthcare system is already socialized in the fact that all the paying customers end up floating the bill for everyone without insurance.  Our prices next year will reflect the amount of free services offered this year.  The way we do it now is not efficient in any manner, we pay an average of 16% of our income to healthcare, where the next highest first world country pays 11% and the world average is around 8%.  
&gt; while de-escalating the regional arms race

???  Iran gets $100 **B**illion regardless

plus their public statements all say "End of Israel" within 25 years
They don't get $100 billion and the deal cripples their ability to have a weapon for at least several years if not longer.  

The real upside is engagement with Iran like the US did with China and other former strategic rivals to the point where the only way they can harm America or Israel in 25 years is by selling shoddy merchandise.
Wow, that's interesting. I would have expected more trading of Rubio and Cruz, though I guess they're pretty known quantities at this point, debating-wise. Excited to see Fiorina though.
The real "outsiders" are Trump, Carson, and to a lesser extent Fiorina. 
they are cowards for sure.
The mainstream leadership doesn't care about those sort of issues. Mit Romney might as well be Obama, Hillary might as well be Jeb Bush.
Anyone trying to stop abortions or stem-cell research is a coward
Donald Trump has done very well with his money. He's done very poorly with other people's money. Unfortunately for him, the latter quality is more relevant to being President.
genius Paul is now at 2% as he continues his idiotic Trump bashing tour
I like Paul, but you're right.  His campaign has not been resonating with anyone.

Even this early.. I would bet money Paul doesn't win. 
Rand Paul is right....but wrong to be saying it like he is. Rand is on his way down and if he really dislikes Trump this much should be throwing his support behind one of the other candidates.
Texas tried to stop abortions, didn't work out so hot:

Wow, someone's homophobic.
Yet no other person is going to get more than 40% of the vote. Damn you democracy you win again!
[deleted]
I'd really like to see this statistic in comparison to other Republicans, rather than Hilary.  At this point comparing Trump to Clinton is like comparing a cat to a dog, there are cat people and there are dog people, so asking the same percentage of each if they would prefer to buy the opposite animal, obviously they are going to go with their preference.   Unlike if you asked a dog lover whether they would prefer a Huskie or a Beagle.  
Where do you live now?
yes, dazzle me with your charts and graphs

meanwhile, the Trump surge up is relentlessly

I call **bull** on this establishment "poll"

BTW, Rush has been talking about the many manners of obfuscation the establishment is attempting out of desperation to derail Trump.  this is one of them
[deleted]
Rush seems to be shilling for Trump.   I don't often catch his show,  but the other week I was working out of my car a lot and every time Rush was on,  he was defending Trump for this or that. 
Cruz and Paul insiders? Um no.
That is a really weird question to ask in my opinion. Obviously he is constitutionally qualified to be President so I'm not even sure what it's supposed to mean. 
All republicans ever want to do is make everyone who is not the 1% poorer than dirt. Like my mom (who lived through the great depression) always told me, they are only for rich people. and they always will be. It has always seemed to me that it is very important to them that there are poor people. You can't be rich if there aren't any poor.
this morning on **both** Fox and CNN ...they were saying yes yes yes
No such video exists; if it did, this wouldn't be a funding issue, the people involved would have been charged with murder, and the site where this happened shut down.
That was my gut feeling so why is she being praised for this comment?  

because it looks good for newsbites.
The last one with Jeb smacking Trump's hand, biting his lip and feeling proud of himself is hilarious!  
The devotion to the farthest right subset of the party is driving me insane.

Why can't we just unfuck this country and let people live their lives as they please in prosperity?
I would contend it is similar to the issue with Islam; the loudest tend to be the most radical. Due to this, the GOP believes their base to be the extreme right wing. Sadly, all this pandering alienates pragmatists like you and I from any party altogether. 
I don't see what's wrong with any of that. Even Donald Trump is most of those things.
without Trump in the mix, that's what you'd get wall to wall

the word Trump was in 44% of the questions asked at the "debate"

European here who's university was subsidised by the state:


There is a reason why the US has 8 of the top 10  best universities in the world, and a large portion of the top 100.

source: https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2015/world-ranking



because they are independent from the state. In Europe your degree isnt worth the paper thats written on it.


and the UK does not have free university, students pay £10,000 a year in fees + accommodation + costs, the state does give them a low interest loan that you pay depending on what you earn, this is by far the best system I've seen, for the US a hybrid system could work too, where 50% the loan is private and 50% is state backed.




Please please dont try and be like us America, we are fucked beyond all recognition, there is a reason why when America sneezes, we feel it over here, its because we are weak, and dependent on America for most of our technology, health/drug development and Businesses.

me too
While I respect your opinion and understand why you may feel this way, I would contend that this will likely lead to a political black hole. As a result — similar to what happened when Saddam Hussein was removed from power in Iraq — a worse situation will result as it is foreseeable that a less moderate republican will take the seat. It follows that the situation in congress will likely be more stagnant than it already is. However, I am not an expert, and as such I may be wrong. 
I'm not sure that the Biblical reference to false prophets applies here, but I get his point. He's had to deal with some ridiculous people and not been able to get the support he needs, but he also hasn't had clean hands either.
Nothing he says can be taken seriously. 
The comments on that article are absolutely horrendous... 

For example:
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;Well this isn't a Democracy, but even if it were, it would be one in which the borders of popular discourse were drawn entirely by self-serving **Jewish parasites** insistent on dominating the rest of us by controlling the range of espousable public opinions.
&gt;
&gt;What can we do? Obey Jewish rule.
&gt;
&gt;What must we never do? Question Jewish rule.
&gt;
&gt;What's the reason? Because **the success of Jewish parasitism ultimately rests on the goodwill and stupidity of its host to not swat it away like we would a mosquito; take a flame to a leech; extinguish with chemicals a horde of plague fleas living among us**; they are always dancing on the edge of a knife and so they must for their own survival be vigilant in destroying anyone who might throw a banana peel underfoot.

I took the liberty to highlight the especially atrocious parts, but I mean this is some fucking Third-Reich level speech here...
Yeah because comments sections are always the bastion of civility and rationale. \s
think I'll tune in at 11:00
Boehner's version of getting things done

&gt; pledged to "get as much finished as possible." Pressing matters include **striking a deal with President Obama** to keep the government open through the coming fiscal year, **raising the federal borrowing** limit, passing a long-term transportation bill and extending popular tax breaks.
Some people already get a net gain from the tax code. That part isn't new.  But it certainly isn't what I support.

I'd be okay with Medicaid if we saw some meaningful reform in the cost side and weren't paying for people with side effects of obesity and alcoholism. 

On principal I'm against it entirely but I'm willing to accept some baby steps. 
If throwing expensive parties for employees is a sound and common business practice for for-profit companies, why is it so bad for non-profits and government agencies?  Can't we agree that for-profits don't want to waste money at all?  I feel like I'm missing something.
Well they tried complaining that a health organization that focuses on *family planning* did not do mammograms. So I guess this is somewhat better. I do hope that they are not deeply hypocritical and will start complaining about the salaries and parties at the Red Cross and at Boeing and all that.

Bernie supporter here. I'd love to see his plan for how he'd achieve universal healthcare without raising taxes and, instead, cutting taxes to a top rate of 25%. Just doesn't seem feasible unless he has something else in mind. I could see him changing the government's budget completely to make room for universal healthcare, but people would wanna see that budget first.
&gt; Why do you vote Republican?

because the alternative is the liberal Hell we have now
Why do you feel as though we live in a liberal hell?
More details as to why you would consider these times "Hell".  Economy is better now than any time this century.  More people are covered by healthcare.  Less people are discriminated against and have equal rights.  We have less war.  We killed the guy we held responsible for 9/11.  We are undoing prohibition of a helpful plant too.
&gt; why these times "Hell". Economy is better now than any time this century

excellent example.  you are in a bubble

where you flat out believe the drivel and lies being pitched to the base.  the economy is horrible, e.g. distortions of the [unemployment rate](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/02/record-94610000-americans-not-labor-force/).  plus [46 million](http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/ali-meyer/food-stamp-beneficiaries-exceed-46000000-38-straight-months) are on food stamps.  it goes on and on

it amounts to your believing agenda-driven "sources" and you not actually investigating alternative voices

I **used** to be a pretty staunch Republican.  They were the party that seemed to best represent:

* focus on economic growth
* smaller, less-invasive government
* liberty &amp; personal responsibility of the individual
  
Basically more libertarian than the Democrat party, but more ordered &amp; functional than the Libertarian party, who at the time I started voting were frankly kind of a chaotic mess.

(I should say, at this point, that I grew up with Reagan and Bush and started voting under Clinton. I mention that because, at the time, it seemed that the majority of the Republican party still held onto most of those values of economic issues over social ones.  There were certainly social issues in the mix - and I felt like that was something that was best kept out of government - but they never felt like the focus of the party)

I still generally consider myself to be a Republican, but I tend to go Libertarian because the Republican party today is not the one I grew up with.  The Conservative movement that now seems to dominate the GOP seems far too focused on social issues, far too inflexible and authoritarian (bordering on theocracy, which scares me to no end), and far too willing to infringe on unpopular liberties at the will of a popular morality - unpopular liberties are the very thing that I feel government is there to protect.

*edited to add* This threatened shutdown over Planned Parenthood is an example. Whether or not you believe the CMP videos about Planned Parenthood, the fact is that $500M is something like 0.1% of the Medicaid budget, 0.01% of the total Federal budget, and 0.08% of the budget deficit.  To have that dominate our national debate seems to me like having a dinner bill that's $2K and getting into a fistfight over who bought the coffee.

Sorry if this has been a bit rambling, but I hope I've given at least some sort of answer.
I'm not a huge fan of the Republican Party right now. Perhaps it's because I live in the Northwest so even conservatives here are very different from Republicans in the South which is where a large part of the Republican voice comes from.

I remain a Republican though because the "good" Republicans, though fewer in numbers than a decade ago are still better than the best Democrats. 

I think the most honest way to answer your question though is to have you spend some time in /r/politics without liberal-colored glasses. It's a pretty terrible place and they represent a party I want little to do with.
My bubble is that I am a highly educated individual with drive an perseverance, and have had my shares of ups and downs too. Sadly, we throw more food away in this country than is necessary, and it is illegal in many instances to give it away.  Many of those receiving SNAP benefits, also have cable, cell phones, cars, game systems, nice clothing and other things that many Americans now consider basics.  With wages stagnating for the past 15 years, I am not surprised more people need assistance when it comes to food, now that there are so many other places for limited resources to go.  If there was only a way to level the difference between what a CEO makes, and their workers make... 

If you believe it is a good thing that 400 people in this country have more wealth than 150,000,000 people, and that these 400 people deserve tax breaks, then it is you who live in a "bubble" too.  If you think that a woman should not have absolute control over her own body, than you are out of step with nearly every woman out there, and most men too.  If you believe that you have the right to discriminate against someone because of a 2000 year old fairy tale, that has been rewritten countless times through out history, then you may be in a "bubble" as well.  We all invent our own realities, and live in our own bubbles come to think of it.  In my opinion, it is in all of our best interest to make sure that each individual is well cared for, since they in turn make better tax payers.  If you want to end well-fare, than begin with the corporations, since they are people now too it would seem.  I personally follow many news sites as I know that there is always more than one perspective to consider.  I am socially liberal in terms of my views, but am also fiscally conservative as well.  I don't like waste anymore than the next person.  Providing healthcare to everyone in this country would be a "good" thing to do, and it would prevent a lot of "bad" things from happening.  Providing free higher public school education would be a "good" thing too, an investment even, as it may produce the next "big" thing.  Maybe combining that free education and extend it to future nurses and doctors could really help people who need it.  We could pay for this by reducing the risks that Wall Street takes by making it more expensive for them to take risks.  Their risks have cost ALL of us trillions of dollars, that could have been better spent elsewhere.  
In my experience people that are pro-life are often middle/upper class families with economic and social ability to support children. They find it hard to understand that single poor mothers can't provide the same and don't want to bring a child knowing they won't have a good life. But if a family can support a child (a product of two people) than why would they need to abort it? I think the reason its such a huge issue is that ultra conservatives are afraid it will spread into the middle class if left unchecked which might be ridiculous. 

It is in our best interest that all individuals are cared for because they pay taxes but to a point where the amount of taxes they pay is higher than the amount government pays for them. Obviously some handicapped people will never beat that threshold and should to be provided for. But that's not the real argument. The real argument is how to provide incentive so that working people will want to learn new skills, get an education, and strive for a better paycheck. While this is something typically engraved into the middle class, US has a lot of trouble providing these incentives for lower classes and many republicans feel that the democratic answer is to give out more welfare checks which doesn't provide the right incentive. 

Big corporations do make a ridiculous amount of money. Sometimes they make that money through some form of exploitation. Some make their trillions off of ideas. But taxing them is a double edge sword. On one hand you will have more money for the federal government to do stuff with but on the other you have companies eager to leave to other places. Whether we like it or not big corporations create employment and in a competitive environment will seek out what benefits them most.

What concerns me most though is the taxation on the middle class and the huge jump of the taxation of those with revenue of $1 and $2 million and up. Upper middle class with that amount of money tend to have their own business from private dentistry to law firm to beer brewery. Those local businesses account for a lot of local employment, money circulation, and make their communities better. But because of taxes they get hit harder than most which makes it harder to open up these local businesses, harder to compete with huge corps, and instead creates incentive to stay in the lower classes where you still have a decent life style. That second to last step before you reach the american dream is broken and its not just you who suffers for it but the people in your community you could be employing. Republicans at local levels at least where I live fight for these upper class business owners and you can literally see the positive effect it has on a locality.

Wall Street are a bunch of crooks. But they aren't the only ones responsible for 2008 recession. They lied, speculated, gave out AAA ratings to those who can't pay stuff back but the people enjoyed it. People were eager to take out loans they can't afford to pay back. People were eager to day-trade with borrowed money. I thinks its just as much a finance education problem as it is a deregulation problem. Plus economic "financialization" has been a good source of wealth not just in the U.S. but in most of Western world. That being said I don't agree with complete deregulation but again want to see politicians find a good balance.

Education in US is ridiculous. In 2012 Obama went through many college campuses and talked about how he knows what its like to be a college student and made a lot of promises. Today college debt is all time high and students take extra years before entering the market. I sound like Im blaming Obama for this but the truth is Romney (or any other president) would not have done much better. One thing for sure though is that Republicans don't get more voters from college campuses, the Dems do.
Remember the guy who said to call the 1980's and ask for its foreign policy back?
LOL.  and Obama will probably fall for this bait
Politically, arguing over morality of killing a child is a safer bet than trying to replan out Medicaid.
 I come representing the Vanguard, a party unique to MHoC. We are a rather loose grouping of the alternative right, united by our desire to defend the British national identity, and the traditions that are the expression of that identity. Over the course of the last few Parliaments, it has become increasingly clear that only the Vanguard (not UKIP or the Conservatives) are the only socially conservative party on MHoC.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/3mgokw/join_sinn_f%C3%A9in_in_the_model_house_of_commons/cvf47s3) is proof of the poor performance of the Conservative Party on social issues. As well as a general slide to the liberal left, UKIP have now on MHoC decided to support reform of the EU over exit, making the Vanguard the only party on the right to support leaving the EU.

I would therefore ask for your vote in this General Election. We are only a small party, so new members are also desired. We are only standing in three constituencies, you don’t have to be British to vote;

* East Midlands (East Midlands)

* North and West Yorkshire (Yorkshire)

* Greater Manchester (North West)

[Voting form is in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/3ni7z5/general_election_iv_megathread/). Don’t forget to verify your vote. If you have any questions let me know.

[deleted]
Why should they love a group that opposes raising their wages, doesn't want them to have the option of Obamacare, and has a vastly different view on gay marriage and pot?
I'm a Millennial and I vote Republican. I've voted in every election since the 2002 midterms and the only Democrats I voted for anything higher than a town position was Joseph Lieberman for Senate and Dick Blumenthal for Attorney General. I'd be a little more open to supporting the Democrats on a statewide/national level if the party wasn't so extreme and against so much of what I believe in. I'm happy to vote for Democrats over Republicans if I like the candidate better, but only in local elections. 

My healthcare is being made far more expensive and with more hurdles by my employer thanks to the ACA, I'd like to see it replaced with expanded Medicaid or something. I used to be pro-pot, then I grew up and wised up and am now against legalized pot. I'm 100% in favor of civil unions but against redefining marriage. That's another one where ignorant Millennials are won over more by emotion than reason and respect for tradition. 
&gt; My healthcare is being made far more expensive and with more hurdles by my employer thanks to the ACA

So it's your employer who's making things more difficult because they don't want to help you? The ACA is far from perfect, but how about we work on fixing it instead of taking it away with no alternative. That solves nothing.

&gt;I used to be pro-pot, then I grew up and wised up and am now against legalized pot.

Well please enlighten the rest of us to your logic because I have yet to hear one good reason especially when you look at the history of booze vs pot and the millions of dollars being made on state levels that is now going to the state as opposed to the drug cartels.

&gt;I'm 100% in favor of civil unions but against redefining marriage.

Well since it's been redefined multiple times over history, your issue seems to boil down to what most people would consider religious persecution by religious people.

&gt;and respect for tradition

Yeah, lets ask the black community about how we should go back to respecting the way things used to be done traditionally. The past is not how the world works anymore. Traditions are nice, but we either adapt or die off. Just look at the music industry. Look at how much damage was done by refusing to adapt to changing times for so long. The industry is still in a state of disarray and now artist are more concerned with live performances because that's where the money is. Ask Blockbuster how refusing to adapt to changing times worked out for them.
&gt;So it's your employer who's making things more difficult because they don't want to help you? The ACA is far from perfect, but how about we work on fixing it instead of taking it away with no alternative. That solves nothing.


The employer is seeing rising costs, kiddo. We now have to take a "health assessment" to avoid a $60 monthly penalty, plus if you want to add your spouse and your spouse has healthcare available with their employer it's another $70. 

It's not just my employer that is hurting. Local hospitals have already started losing money. All have dropped their pension, and all have merged. Two on the shoreline formed into a single group, then their new group merged with Yale. The hospitals inland both merged with Hartford Hospital. 

I gave you an alternative to the ACA bullshit. Put down the bong and read the comment again. 

&gt;Well please enlighten the rest of us to your logic because I have yet to hear one good reason especially when you look at the history of booze vs pot and the millions of dollars being made on state levels that is now going to the state as opposed to the drug cartels.


Pot needs to be controlled, period. The "look at booze" argument is an argument in favor of ALL drugs. 

More [kids](http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2015/09/30/denver-underage-marijuana-sale/73105722/) are [smoking](http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/09/20/smart-colorado-hearing-from-hundreds-hundreds-of-parents-about-pot-use/) pot in CO now, adults too. This push to treat pot like it's not this big deal has resulted in an [epidemic](http://www.wsj.com/articles/more-college-students-use-marijuana-daily-study-finds-1441124840) of use on college campuses nationwide.  There are long-term health issues with increased pot use, there are obvious safety issues with increased pot use, and there are productivity issues as heavy pot use makes you lethargic and stupid.  

&gt;Well since it's been redefined multiple times over history, your issue seems to boil down to what most people would consider religious persecution by religious people.


We're talking about Western civilization and no redefinition has been as dramatic as this. Religious people WILL be persecuted under this law. People are already calling for "bigoted" churches such as the Catholics, the largest Church in the world, to lose their tax exemption under this. Catholic adoption agencies are already under pressure. The Catholic church simply won't change their position on this. It's the one Christian church that doesn't change its doctrine. Other churches including the Muslims, Orthodox Jews, Mormons, Evangelicals, etc will still be holdouts. It will cause all sorts of friction. All we had to do was pass a civil union law and "divorce" the marriage from government altogether.  

&gt;Yeah, lets ask the black community about how we should go back to respecting the way things used to be done traditionally

There's a lot of black people who respect tradition. The left was very angry over how the blacks voted in California when gay marriage was on the ballot. 

Preserving traditions is how you preserve your culture and your nation. Your country is built on the shoulders of those who came before you. In America's case, the people who started our country really were giants. 


&gt;Look at how much damage was done by refusing to adapt to changing times for so long. The industry is still in a state of disarray and now artist are more concerned with live performances because that's where the money is. Ask Blockbuster how refusing to adapt to changing times worked out for them.


The music industry has been hurt by people who steal content. They're the victims here! Blockbuster is a better example. They tried to copy RedBox but by the time they caught on Red Box and Netflix were killing their business model.

If only we had a committee so dedicated to accountability after 9/11.
I think a big wad of the underestimators are in the political establishment and the lame stream media

NOT among the folks on Main Street
edit: decided to just not argue.

Sorry.
apparently she doesn't know shit
Well, it certainly wasn't Bernie
why not?
Drudge poll gave Bernie a landslide victory.
Dems are a cult of personality and celebrity and Hill will be the next big thing, trust them. 

Sheryl Crow singing the national anthem to begin is a perfect example.
Don't be surprised, but don't buy into it too much, either. The places that say Hillary won have a lot of reason to say so. For example: CNN is owned by Time Warner (one of her bigger campaign (&amp;career) contributors). Huffington post as well; Arianna Huffington is a personal friend of Hillary's. 

Be wise, always look for more information and always, always, follow the money. You'll find the answers you're looking for.
She "won" by not screwing it up.  The nomination is hers to lose a bad performance could have really done damage.
they wrote the "she won the debate" weeks ago

it's the agenda, get Hillary elected, no matter what
Because you don't make up all young people. Why bother coming to this sub?
I don't but the vast majority of young people want those things.
Bernie didn't prove he'd be a good president.  He proved he'd be a leftist extremist and asked people to be okay with that.  Historically they have not been okay with that.
we are

the opposite would be partnering with Dems...which never works
oh my gosh, I totally forgot about Christie
FDR?
How many conservative states have outlaws smoking by pregnant women? How many conservative states have outlawed drinking by pregnant women? 

The difference here is that liberals think that the pregnant women can make decisions. The conservatives think that for some decisions about the fetus the law has to make the decision, not the woman or her doctor.


Donald Trump is the frontrunner of the party right now. I think that its safe to assume that the party is already "cooked".


I love how liberals think that by putting "The American People" at the beginning of a sentence, they are officially speaking for the American people.
totally disagree
Both sides do that.
He's so fake.  Just like Cruz, Bush, Huckabee.  Ugh.
Bernie kicked her ass.

Time Warner is the 8th largest donor for Hillary's campaign.  Time Warner owns CNN.  On CNN's poll results, Bernie Sanders vastly dominated.  CNN quickly deleted it.

I like when Bernie Sanders said at the debate that "Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street.  Wall Street regulates congress."
Yep.
Yep.
She screwed up when she talked about Wall Street and the big banks.
Most Dems don't like Hillary.  The media is trying to make it look otherwise.
Ted Cruz was so fake and cliche at the debates, I about fell asleep.
He seemed like the least authentic candidate at the debates.
I wonder if you understand what SuperPACs are and how they function, given you claim Sanders refuses to "have one".  Further, unions are as much a special interest group as the evil big money corporations,

You are welcome to support his liberal ideology but it far too at odds with Republican thinking, no matter how refreshing his "honesty" is.  On that subject, a candidate who cares more about getting thier message out than appealing to a base or pandering is refreshing and exciting, but if the message is wrong, it hardly matters.  

Sanders premises are just incorrect, and it only seems like he not pandering.  He's a populist, and even if he himself believes it, all hes really doing is telling people what they want to hear, what they wish to be true, and promoting fallacies to justify his reasoning.
Sorry, mate, but I disagree.
Ok?
(Sigh.) I guess you want me to do the work for you.

Here are Bernie's top donors so far (Please take an actual look at the link.)

https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contrib.php?cycle=All&amp;id=N00000528&amp;type=

His top donor is Google in the amount of just under $15K.

That's breadcrumbs compared to other politicians who have SuperPacs.

Bernie is legit and he isn't getting enough money from anyone to owe them special favors.

Also, I have conservative family members and friends who are in favor of Bernie because they like his honesty and willingness to take on big money.

Bernie has already raised millions in small donations from the middle-class.
Screw Bernie. 
So?
I tuned into the dem debate hoping to see what the big deal was with bernie.  Turns out he's just an angry old man who couldn't even express one coherent thought.  One hateful anti-American talking point after another.

It's no secret that people who like Bernie are typically the low-information voters, but after hearing him speak, I think it's more like the low-intelligence voters.  Seriously, what is this clown's appeal?
Here ya' go:

postgraduates who mainly were unfit for the real world, so never managed to escape the world of 'academia', which, by the way, has no correlation to intelligence.

nice try, though
One, the website you linked to isn't working.

Two, your source is politically biased.

Try again.
What about Ben Carson? 
You claimed that Bernie supporters are "low information", then talk about intelligence. Did you have a consistent point?


&gt;By the way, Bernie is more popular amongst Democrats than Hillary,

Every bit of real evidence say otherwise.

&gt;but Time Warner and their subsidiary, CNN is trying to make Hillary look like dems' preferred choice.

Do you understand the difference between representative polls and self selected on-line polls? On-line polls are not even inaccurate, they are just noise. Representative polls can have varying degrees of accuracy but all of them say that Clinton is far more popular than Sanders.

&gt;They're trying to screw him like what happened to Ron Paul, who seemed like a good guy.

Do you actually think that Paul was the most popular Republican in 2012.


He seems like an honest guy.  However, he's too mix-church-and-state for me, friend.  Plus, I'm unwaivering on my liberal ideologies.  

You should vote your conscience though.
oh yea, Bernie is as pure as the driven socialist snow [or is it green](http://www.ibtimes.com/election-2016-bernie-sanders-fundraiser-beverly-hills-raises-150000-night-wealthy-2142440)?
Quasi-socialist.  There's a difference. 
 :)

Edit:

Quasi-socialism just means a capitalistic system that also incorporates a social safety net for the middle and lower class in the event that big money (and big government corrupted by big money) becomes too powerful.
all of a sudden we have shades of grey.  bottom line: socialists are fools who want to invent a system which has failed 100% of the time it's been tried.  it's absurd.  any mild venture into the documentation proves it's insanity

the events I am waiting for now

1. will Hillary be arrested?
2. who wins the first three Republican primaries?

SuperPACs can't donate to campaigns. No candidate is taking donations from them.
people are hoping that they can have a good life without putting any work or thought into it, and at the same time they can pretend to be helping the poor while theyre feeding off of hard working people's money
I'm not letting a commie into the White House. And neither will most Americans.
So what is your plan to build the Anarcho-Capitalist Utopia here on Earth?

Voting 500 Ron Pauls into Congress?

Seasteading?

Black Markets?

Moving to Somalia/Antarctica?
why don't Paul, Christie, Fiorina, Kasich, and Huckabee quit now?
LOL thx 4 this
&gt; will Hillary be arrested?

lol no

&gt;who wins the first three Republican primaries?

If he hasnt dropped out by then, better hope it's Bush. Or Rubio. 

If it's Carson, Trump, or Fiorina, the GOP is in trouble. None of them can have serious one on one debate with Sanders or Clinton. Or even Biden, if by some small chance he wins the nomination. In fact, Biden would probably destroy them worse. 
you seem to prefer an establishment style debate exchange

the people hate that crap and want out via Trump, or Carson, stop
McConnell's Senate is a joke.  there have been no debates of substance, no close votes, no reason to show up.  not defending Rubio, just stating the obvious
Seriously, people keep bringing up his name with absolutely nothing that backs up WHY they or anyone else should support him. The reasons I've heard include that he has good posture, that he seems like a "nice guy" or that he *appears* to be genuine or honest. 

But seriously, if you can't point to a platform and positions and ideas from your candidate... you are basically supporting an empty suit with good posture and how does that help anyone?  
You are seriously trying to convince republicans and right-leaning people to support a self-proclaimed socialist because... he doesn't believe in "birth-right citizenship?" Or because he "doesn't have a SuperPAC" and you approve of how he is raising campaign funds? 

I know some people are single-issue voters but that seems a little weak to me. Besides, I don't see anything about that on [his website](https://berniesanders.com/issues/fair-and-humane-immigration-policy/) or [his OnTheIssues immigration page](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Bernie_Sanders_Immigration.htm) in fact he is just as liberal regarding illegal immigration as he seems to be with everything else. 
He and his family name is more than welcome to go do that instead of continue a family dynasty.
Elaborate, I'm a hard Bernie supporter, first person I ever donated too and willing to go out and advocate for him, through handing out fliers or other forms activism, I want this man to be president. I believe in the man, but i would like to hear a different perspective of him, it would be refreshing 
Why only limit them to liberal cities, and not all cities? I know there is a Child Endangerment Law in Alabama which is used to send pregnant women to jail for doing drugs, since the fetus is considered a child.
but i don't know how liberal Alabama is, and its a state not a city so it might not be in your criteria 
missing almost 1/3 of your votes is pathetic though!
I'll bite.  Let's start by you telling me one view of Bernie Sanders' that you agree with, please be specific (no "He tells it like it is" "he wants to make the greedy rich pay their fair share")
okay, free college tuition by using financial speculation tax
Perfect, this is actually a prime example of Bernie's flawed economic thinking.  So the plan is tax trades - like a sales tax.  But what happens if people have to pay for each trade?  They trade less (and less trading then means less revenue from the tax).  This is not a possibility - this is exactly what Bernie and other advocates of FTT hope will happen - as they believe less trading will reduce market volatility.  In fact, many believe less trading will increase market volatility, as more trading provides more up to date information for traders.  And so less information means now EVEN LESS trading.  On top of this now, with less trading and less profit from those trades (due to the tax) - there's less capital gains to tax, and now the government is getting less revenue for other things.  
That may be true, but its not taxing everything wall street does, just speculation. its not FTT its FTS, its not taxing every transaction that occurs, its taxing the riskiest sort of trade, speculation. Speculation is part of the reason 2008 crash happened, so for example, lets say you buy a million dollar home that you cant afford in the long run, what you try to do is sell it as quick as possible for a 10% profit, what happens when you cant sell it? High risk High gains, so this tax would hopefully disincentive that kind of trade. When an individual does it, the impact isn't great, when wall street does it when billions of dollars, the people are the ones to suffer and leads to things like bailouts like we seen in 2008. And there is different sort of FTS, it doesn't necessarily have to tax the housing market. Anyways we've done these sort of taxes in the past and its not a new concept, (1914-1960s), and so far 29 developed nations are using this sort of methods to raise funds, so is there true harm in trying it out?
I am seeing conflicting reports on the extent to which he plans to tax transactions, but I am bit confused by your statement as you yourself admit that the tax will hopefully "disincentivise" the very trades you hope to tax and gain revenue from for tuition-free college.
Ya, and i tried to find how much money is made through these kind of practices from wall street, but i couldn't find a number. But it would take 62.9 billion dollars to make student tuition free for everyone, if you subtract the 21.8 billion in grants that state students already get from the fed, 40 more billion. Student loan debt is 1.2 trillion dollars, 7 million people in America have already defaulted. Now i don't know if this tax will pay for all of the student debt, It would have to be implemented to fully understand the numbers, but with these disgusting numbers on debt, the american people deserve a shot at free college tuition and a chance to refinance already existing loans, don't you think?...PS im pretty drunk so I hope i make some sense
Not my first choice, but a much better front runner than Trump
I agree with the second part of your comment.  

About the first part, I haven't made up my mind about which candidates out there I would like, yet.
Would you consider Carson your favorite, or at least tied with your favorite? Or do you have your own front runner? (As in, who you want most)
votes on what?  McConnell has the Senate rigged, like Reid did
I like Carson a lot because I admire his long-standing focus on public education and changing the culture of poor/minority public schools that idolize sports kids and marginalize/bully nerds.  He has a vision for changing the dynamic of bad public education for poor/minority kids, which can potentially affect (tens of) millions of lives and uplift our society &amp; economy in big ways.

I guess I don't have a sense of what the other candidates are really passionate about yet, or where their sense of mission is.  Trump seems self-promoting and too calculating/manipulative in his attacks on others for me to get a sense for what he might want to do in office other than to win.

Bernie Sanders seems to update his platform off the front page of reddit, so he's morphing into some pop-progressive who is channeling online activist culture on a week to week basis.  If he's a true socialist, I don't see it.  I actually seem him as more of a Trump than a real politician, because of his transparent, calculating attempts to play for attention.

I see Hillary Clinton as being in John McCain's shoes from 2008: she's so trapped by a base that balks at accepting her, that I don't see how she is doing anything but being defined by her need to chase the base.  The progressive base needs an icon to put on a unrealistic pedestal of idealism and then it is happy, even if the icon fails to deliver on the agenda (like Obama has failed).  Hillary, as a pragmatist, doesn't do that preachy-idealism thing and so the base will never want her as their pin-up donkey, even though she's popular with moderates.  If she doesn't have real support of the liberal media and her base, she won't have the political capital to accomplish much of anything.  

I'm too busy to keep up with the churn on the right, with Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina popping in and out of the media focus.  I think the party could do a better job of selling who these candidates are.  I'm not sure what to make about Jeb Bush's inability to make headway.

I think Carson is most out there with what he's passionate about doing and that's why he has a positive approval rating and is currently in the lead (not to mention his impressive record of professional service, with leadership roles).
I'm most concerned with a WINNER in the general election

Trump will vastly be a tougher man to beat then Carson
The polls do seem to reflect that Trump supporters are firmer in their support of Trump than Carson's supporters are in their support of Carson.  But Trump has been in the media a lot, so people have a lot more info on him.
Cruz, Carson and Paul are the only candidates that really matter
[deleted]
&gt; But Trump has been in the media a lot

yea, plenty of Main Street love and establishment/media hate keep The Donald in the news.  plus he works hard.  although I didn't watch any, I noticed Trump was booked on **THREE** Sunday political talk shows

lots of energy
He has a lot of vulnerabilities, that's true.
Thanks for your opinion.  I'll keep an eye out for them.  I think Cruz has just swapped places with Fiorina and is moving up in the polls.
Energy is good.  Especially when you look at the field of elderly Democratic candidates!  A GOP candidate with a lot of energy and staying power should take advantage of that, whomever he/she is.
hmmm, Trump abuse?  I though ED was controlled and ruled by government
I don't think this is accurate. I looked up [some state polling] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_United_States_presidential_election%2C_2016) (Wikipedia, I know, so take it with at least a tablespoon of salt) and it didn't seem to reflect this at all. While Paul wins in some of the red states (Texas, for instance), there don't seem to be polls putting him ahead in the blue or purple ones this graphic claims. I looked for instance at New York (my home state), Michigan (a Democratic state that could be vulnerable to the right kind of Republican), and Virginia (a swing state) and didn't see any poll that suggests this. Clinton is significantly ahead of Paul in just about all those surveys. 

Even if I'm looking at incomplete data, I doubt there's any data that show this in a way that really applies in a presidential election. Favorability ratings are fickle, especially for people who are not well known. I'm sure that most people who have heard of Rand Paul view him favorably, but that's because people who wouldn't generally like him haven't gone through the trouble of figuring out much about him yet. Favorability ratings for candidates don't usually mean much until they're actually in the heat of an election. Go take a look at Clinton's approval rating when she's not running for anything (like when she was secretary of state) and you'll see what I mean. 

General Election match up polls also usually mean very little at this point - most voters are answering based on low information, so results are usually just based on their favorability towards the more well known candidate. In this case, it means that more voters have reasons to dislike Clinton and therefore choose someone else even if they don't know much about her. This is also why Bernie Sanders crushes Trump in these polls. Who knows if he'd do the same in the general? 

Want to compare Clinton and Paul in polls? Use the same polls that the media keeps insisting on using. A solid majority of Clinton's own party wants her to be president. A tiny fraction of Paul's wants him. Paul could conceivably turn that around, but without the support of Republicans, Paul would be crushed by Clinton in any head to head match up.
Polling is never an easy thing. 

for one, the Wikipedia link you gave isn't bad data necessarily. It's all referenced with the source poll. The issue is that it's all very old. The latest polls I saw on that link were from 2014, which was before Trump was even in the conversation. A lot has changed in a year and I do believe that a year ago, Paul would've been beating Hillary in some states. However, that would never have happened in a state like New York. She was our Senator. We are strongly Democratic (in terms of population). No way does he poll better than she.

I mostly agree with what you've said except the last point. A poll that would test public opinion on a Clinton-Paul general election matchup could be accurate. While Paul might only be getting 3% amongst Republican voters now, that's only because they have someone else they prefer. Paul could very well be *everyone's* second choice but *nobody's* first choice. This is why it's important to look at the whole picture in terms of polling: favorability, head-to-head, and support polls.

Sure. I'm not denying that Paul has support. So much is still up in the air. 

But that graphic, as far as I can tell, is lying. Your point about how New York isn't a great place to point to is well taken, yet the graphic *still insists that Paul is polling ahead of Clinton there.* That is simply not true. It's also not true in Virginia or Michigan (where Clinton was not a senator) but the graphic insists it is as well. 

You're right that it's old polling. But is there new polling that contradicts it? Until I see some, we're arguing about nothing. 
I don't think I was very clear but I completely agree with you: this graphic is an outright lie. It verges on conspiracy theory but I don't want to get into that when there are more legitimate, serious issues with it.

The truth is that Paul may very well be held in higher regards than Clinton in many states. However, New York is certainly not one of those states and unfortunately no poll has been able to confirm any such support in most other states.

EDIT: My point about it having been old polling was mostly to point out that (1) Wikipedia isn't really a bad source since it references the polling source and (2) that *maybe* Paul was seen more favorably a year ago but I would think that has changed. Paul's numbers amongst Republicans were better a year ago than they are today, let alone his numbers amongst all general voters.
Oh cool we agree. I was just not expecting that on the internet so I reflexively kept arguing. Woohoo! 
Can anyone explain how Trump and Carson differ? To me they seem very similiar. Kinda sorta fiscally conservative, with strange opinions on other issues and a penchant for saying offensive/stupid things.
I think Trump might turn out to have more depth of character than the popular media makes out and Carson might turn out to be more of a charismatic than people who think he's too quiet might assume.  But otherwise, I think Carson is more social conservative and Trump is more business/fiscal conservative.

(There are a lot of very well informed conservatives on reddit who can answer this question better)
He seems like a quality candidate over all of these other fools on top; though I'd like to know more about him. I'd vote for him, I cant say the same about Trump...
Lots of info over at /r/StandwithRand and /r/Randpaul!! :)
he doesn't believe in "birth-right citizenship"? that sounds inaccurate, birth right citizenship is apart of the 14th amendment, i believe its republicans who want to end it to end anchor babies.

and besides his message, how he is reasing his campaign funds is important. What  i don't get is how we can elect leaders, know full well that they were bought out by corporations, republicans and democrats, we need to stop that practice, and he is the ONLY candidate that is doing that, besides Trump, but if you want him as president, to each their own then
[removed]
The data is old probably because few people are doing statewide head to head polling. Why look at Clinton/Paul in IL or CA or TX? It would only matter if people are deeply poll driven. 


It's totally inaccurate, I was responding to the OP - no where on his website, campaign messaging or OnTheIssues does he challenge that. But even if he did, that wouldn't be reason enough to vote for someone so at odds in such an EXTREME capacity from core republican/conservative/libertarian/moderate beliefs. 

Campaign finance reform is a HUGE issue, I agree with you on that. Unfortunately the way you fix that is not by electing one grassroots politician - that was supposedly Obama back in 2008. We've had plenty of outsider politicans who have been good and who have been bad. Bernie's entire platform is very bad for America IMO. I don't believe our country can or should support socialist policies, I think our Federal government is ALREADY far too powerful and that the government doesn't exist to solve the problems of the populous. 

I, and many right-leaning people are very at odds with everything he is saying and stands for which was what I was trying to convey to the OP. 
Well Ben Carson tried to stab a kid when he was 14 apparently and wants to reverse Roe V Wade so I know who I'm not voting for...
Here's a quick one.. an example of Rand Paul refusing to toe the Republican party line:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9qSrf7XPTg

Personally, anyone that aggravates Sean Hannity is a winner in my book.
Rand will outlast Carlie and Chris. There's no way either of them stay for the long haul. 
That'd only be because the Pauls have a tendency to stay in the race far past the point where it's already clear that they will not even be a factor at the convention. In Rand Paul's case there is already pressure on him to focus on protecting his Senate seat since it is clear that he's in the bottom tier to stay in the presidential race. For that reason I expect him to drop out by Super Tuesday. 
I'm a Democrat, but I did enjoy the Repubs bashing the media.  I think both CNN and Fox News filter information to promote their agenda.

It was also refreshing to hear some Repubs bash SuperPacs, lobbyists, and special interest groups.
Not a chance.  He's pretty secure in his senate seat.  Polls are a supplement for reality, not reality. Aside from not being representative, 70% of those polled are completely undecided and are only leaning towards the candidates they pick.
The reality is Ted Cruz is a smarter and more eloquent politician than Rand Paul and he's taking a lot of the voters that Rand Paul was hoping to get, others including Trump are also taking some of those guys. Meanwhile, Rand Paul's attempts to be less extreme than his father has turned off some of his father's followers. 

The polls for the GOP nomination can be used to get an idea of who will be the serious players once the primaries start. Paul's way down in the gutter right now and there is no compelling reason to think that he will turn that around. 
there are four, but really, only one.  I declare it over

Trump/Cruz 2016 !!!
CNBC did a terrible job this round. That said the candidates worked to avoid discussing issues. For the other debates Trump sucks all the air out of the room so it is hard to judge. And you can't compare a debate among 10 with a debate of 2+3.

One of my questions now is whether the Republican electorate will care that Carson just does not tell the truth about things. He seems to have this history of saying things. Then when asked he denies he said that. [Asked about Mannatech Carson said he was not involved with them.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/29/ben-carson/debate-ben-carson-says-he-has-no-connection-mannat/) That is just not so. So will Republican voters care more that he does not tells the truth or more that the media did a "gottcha"?
He will be polling lower than Fiorina when she drops out. (As for Christie I have no idea why he is in the race.) Rand will drop out by SC when he realizes he has to change jobs from running for president to running for the Senate.

Cruz's positioning is amazing. On paper I thought that Rand had the better chance. And for some time a year or so ago it looked that way for real. But Cruz has been far better operationally and Rand has just lost steam.

Christie is dead man walking. I don't know how he thinks he has a chance. I'm not sure about Fiorina. The others are on my list as the top as well. I'm thinking Rubio and someone outside politics. Trump/Cruz is no longer as laughable a proposition as it was.

CNBC did a horrid job and it will cost them financially.  That being said, the RNC needs to find a way to lower the number of people in the thing.

When you have 10+ people and only 2 hours it's really hard to accomplish much.  
Explain to me what a "gotcha question" is. And why do GOP candidates fear them so much?
neither fit the definition nor conventional meaning of debate
UGH. Yeah- I'm feeling you on that. I think that with the current polls. Carson Lying, and Trump (the joke) being the only other contender. America may have no choice but to let a Democrat win.
The GOP is going to pick either Trump or Rubio. And, no, I won't put a single penny on my guess.


Well we got one shitty governor who cannot decide what party he is in and a republican governor who is total ass
I blame the overwhelming number of people that are not willing to vote for him.
come on Bush.  your campaign has been a limp dick.  it's you, pal
Jeb can fix it.

I know what you are referring to. But he can't fix it.
It's a question designed to embarrass the candidate. 

Example from the debate: "You've done very well on this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it, send 11 million people out of the country, cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit, and make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others. Let's be honest, is this a comic-book version of a presidential campaign?"

Every point he makes prior to the last sentence could have been made into a legitimate question. But with the last sentence the interviewer spins it so that the audience presupposes that Trump's candidacy is illegitimate.

These questions piss me off so much as a voter. Instead of having to answer for the points in the beginning of the question, Trump must instead assert that his candidacy is legitimate.

Candidates MUST be asked tough questions in a debate. But these "gotcha" questions are simply designed to embarrass the candidates and so instead of hearing about actual solutions to the problems facing the country, we just hear how a candidate will respond to a blatant insult.
Well, I mean my rebuttal would be - when you have candidates promising to rope the moon and drag it down to Earth - about the only thing you can do is poke fun of such ludicrous claims. 
Interesting point. The question I always wonder is how "pro-life" can apply to people who support state-sanctioned killing in the form of the death penalty. 
That's true; I hadn't thought about that one.  If we support such killing, we are most certainly pro-death in those cases even though statistically we know it is a scientific fact that innocent people do sometimes get convicted and killed. It happens because of racism in the jury or prosecutor / police misconduct, etc... it actually happens more than anyone wants to think about except the good people who work for The Innocence Project and other non-profits. 
Yeah. Independent of all the wrongful execution cases, in my opinion being pro death penalty makes it hard to argue "pro-life". I'm not trying to argue against it in this case (though I do in others), but it just seems crazy to argue that supporting life in all cases doesn't extend to a desire to kill criminals. 
The viewpoint is about choice. A baby doesn't choose to impregnate the mother but an adult can choose to kill someone.  I get the argument. I think that is why the term "pro-life" is not entirely accurate term. 

What I don't understand are the pro-life people who are also against contraceptives. If you want fewer abortions, there should be contraception everywhere. 
I'd never want a King Bush the 3rd anyway.
As a youtube viewer you take back your dislike from a video (just re-click the thumbs down button). If you're right about your observed numbers than a mere 175 people decided they didn't dislike the video after all. A little weird, but nothing earth shattering.

In other words, keep the same strategy going that's failed Republicans for twenty years. 

You know what might work? Fielding a decent candidate.
First you have to field a candidate that doesn't completely agree with her foreign policy.
it would an absolute blast putting together anti-Hillbag TV commercials

If the republicans were really pro-life, they would support sensible gun control, universal health care, integration of neighborhoods, abortions, health and sex education, and much more.

Except they don't. Carson, is, at this rate not even making it into the next primetime debates. Rand Paul is in second, whilst Trump retains the crown for first.
"The winners where pretty obvious: Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and Marco Rubio"

Fuck off. It was pretty obviously Rand Paul's night to shine.
https://youtu.be/kvVMvPQdJ4Q

yfw Trump is Stumped 
Hearing him seem to concede his usual blustering theatrics to a seemingly well-reasoned and calm response was throughly enjoyable. 
Hahaha wow. I think you need a new Comms director Hillary. Anyone working for a Clinton should know how to brush off incriminating facts
Rand Paul's a loser,  but I'll give it to you it was his best debate night so far. It as also the best night yet for ¡Jeb!

Paul barely made it into this debate and I have to give credit to a past debate appearance where he was 11th and should have been in the loser's debate for keeping him above the 2.5% threshold required for the Fox Business debate. Rand Paul should be thankful that they let him show up! He's got no support to speak of! 
Rand Paul is in second place in your own mind. In realityville Rand Paul is in the low single digits. 
Obviously satire, but as I've been saying, smarminess cannot win you a national election.  Rand Paul is everything Ted Cruz claims to be and more.  Fiscal conservative, civil libertarian, and much to the dismay of /u/Clatsop, the TRUE CANDIDATE representing the Liberty Movement.
I do like teddy as well, but he has been taking rand's taking points lately. Kind of lame. Also, I don't want an increased military so Rand has my vote!

Satire or not, I really can't stand looking at or listening to Ted for more than about 4 seconds.

Thanks for the reply, man. I realize that the process may be long, and probably not really all that worth the effort, but I'm tired of taking people who don't know what they're talking about by their word.
Rand is awesome, I just wish Rand was better at explaining why he's right :/
Mission accomplished.
[removed]
/u/tamminus Do you think this status is accurate? 
No, I think it is interesting. I don't agree with Coulter, but I think she has an understanding of how a lot of people do think. As for Trump almost everything about his campaign bewilders me so I have no meaningful comment. It would not have occurred to me that Paris helped Trump. Yet I saw this in another sub and pretty much everyone agreed. 
Ah, that makes sense. 
GOP should run a campaign of their strengths.  Not Democrat weaknesses.
Edit: fuck rick scott
He was even running?
I don't think Republicans will "win." I think it remain largely the same. 
Sorry, [didn't happen](http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/putinduma.asp).
That's just semantics though, right?  Because to me when there is a competition and one side does better than the other, that's a "win".
Sort of since it does truly depend on how you judge it. In politics, there's a lot of nuance. I don't think the seat distribution remaining the same dictates a win for the GOP. A real win for the GOP would be a super majority in the Senate, or at least coming very close to the point where super majorities would be easily obtained in coalition with conservative Dems.

For instance, if Republicans are numerically expected to gain 3 seats in the Senate, but only end up gaining 1, then Democrats "won" because they did fairly well in defending, and vice versa. 

Another example would be if there's high turnout and the Democrats win the White House, but still Republicans gain even just one seat in the Senate, then that's a big win for the GOP.

To me, the way I read the headline was that "GOP will hold the Senate" based on the idea that Republicans will "win again in 2016." I agree that Republicans will likely hold the Senate, but I don't think they'll "win" on a grander scale. I have them pegged to gain one seat at best in aggregate, switching some seats with Democrats.
Rubio
Paul. It's hard to disagree with most of his logic. He's just not loud mouthed enough to show it although he stepped up last debate. He's more of an intellectual type like Carson, without necessarily willing to interrupt. 
Who?
Rand
Romney. It's going to happen.
Rand the man
An "intellectual type like Carson"???? 
*wispers* they both doctors
I really want Paul, but as far as people in the lead/has the best bet of getting the nom, Rubio has the best chance against Clinton.
boy oh boy, we're in DEEP trouble below the top tier
Rand 100%
Too early to say who I prefer as a nominee, but I'd say I'd like Kasich to get some more screen test time.
i agree
Chechnya.
/r/thathappened
then Rubio should go

fuck that killing of more Americans
Fuck the devolution of an entire corner of the planet that risks the lives of the western world /s. Freedom isn't free. This is a bloody power vacuum that the west helped create from complacency.
just another libtard attempt to pitch establishment candidates, Kasich and Rubio
the history of America is all about rugged individualism, the antithesis of socialism.  although we are currently in a struggle against all things government and nameless, faceless, unaccountable bureaucratic controls,  our heritage is still strong
[deleted]
It's very much the fault of the education system and the media. The schools fail to properly disseminate information of different styles of government and the media uses the word socialism like a slur. 

Also, central and western Europeans have had the benefit of being close to Scandinavian countries. After the red scare, people were able to warm up to socialism in Europe because it was easy to travel to a place where it exists and works. In America, many Americans don't have the opportunity to travel and learn about other ways of life. After the red scare, the American public couldn't really leave their paranoia behind them. 


I think you pretty much hit it on the nail, it's not all about us hating the Russians or the media skewing our vision, it's a lot simpler. The states were founded by people who wanted better for themselves and wanted to be more free from a government, as in they can do what *they* want with their money. 
I'm not going to get into why I personally dislike socialism, but I'm going to touch on your last point.

The US has 300 million people. Almost half of the entire EU and more than the socialized nations there. While European nations have lots of neighbors and little space, we're the opposite.

The US is extremely different from Western Europe, which is why we shouldn't try and run things the same way.
I feel that the mainstream media makes it appear that the republican party is focused on religion too much. I can't say I've met or seen many real life experiences of the conservative religion extremism that the media portrays. I'm sure they exist, but probably no more frequently than "extreme liberalism".
People like success. You spend government money on the interstate highway system, and everyone's like, "Hell yeah, roads are awesome. I love driving. I love getting goods delivered efficiently and quickly."

You spend government money on the space program, and people can still go, "Cool. We put a man on the moon! It doesn't really help my daily life as far as I can see, but now we've got satellites so I can use GPS and get solid weather forecasting. Go NASA."

You spend taxpayer money on poverty relief, and we look around and say, "Why are there still so many poor people? You guys must be screwing up, because the thing you're trying to fix is still here."

Now, poverty's a big problem. I think we can all agree that it's not possible for every single person to have the education, opportunity, and motivation to rise up from poverty to the middle class or higher. And most people will generally be in favor of charities, because donations to those are voluntary.

But many Americans aren't a fan of having to pay tax dollars for programs that look like they're not working. 
I seems to me that, at least here in Georgia, the Religious Right is alive and well.  It's not unusual to see bumper stickers on some christian conservative topic or other, and our main talk radio station has Herman Cain in the morning and Erick Erickson in the afternoon, neither of whom are shy about mixing religion and politics.

I find it unfortunate, because it feels like the Republican / Conservative party that I used to support is gone and in its place is a group just as eager as the Democratic party to use government to control people - just in different ways.
I was pushed out of the county party because I attended a "Mainstream Republican" meeting I was invited to when I first moved to the county. This had me blackballed (they always ran a PCO against me) because to them it meant I wasn't anti-abortion enough. Mainstream Republicans don't take a stand on abortion. I was never asked nor stated my opinion on abortion. I was an active member and then elder of a conservative Presbyterian church (a relative of Sarah Palin attended). But the line on abortion was so firm that attending a Republican meeting that wasn't openly anti-abortion made me a heathen liberal to the Republican leaders. And abortion, at least in our area, was very tied to religion.

This wasn't in the South it was in the Pacific Northwest. Religion is very important to many Republicans. It isn't just the media hyping it.
Ted Cruz maybe,  but not all. 
There's a big difference between religious extremism and being religious. I feel way to many people make that connecting line when it doesn't always exist. Sure there's religious right nut jobs, just as there are liberal left nut jobs. But the overall generalization is not nearly as extreme in opinion base as expected. I don't see how one could possibly believe that when the majority of republicans (under age 65) are pro gay marriage, but that they are also majority religious nut jobs. There's a big difference in party alignment on both left and right compared to media presentation. Also, you're pretty biased based on your experience. Honestly, there's many parts of my belief structure that swing pretty far left, but the core and majority of me is fairly conservative (and i'm not religious at all).

Edit: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/10/61-of-young-republicans-favor-same-sex-marriage/ resource stats to show age disparity and paradigm shift in the party.
You're making large generalizations based on anecdotal evidence. I'm sure it is alive and well, just as the left has extreme socialist and communistic "believers" alive and well. You're nut jobs will always be more outspoken and stand out, making it appear like they are more in number than the really are. Back that with media blitzing, and voila, there the belief stems from. Look at some statistics on topics on majority republican beliefs and if you rule out over age 65 (which is currently the outlier, still factors, but never-the-less it is outlier opinion) that younger republicans are pro-gay marriage, abortion has a time and place BUT should not be used as "oops i fucked up control" as a majority opinion. Most younger republicans (i'm late 20's, so i guess it depends what you consider young), are republican not because of social issues, but because of how we feel the government should be involved in our lives. In fact i'm extremely anti-right when it comes to environmental policy and socially disagree with a lot of conservative programs/beliefs, but i stay republican due to personal freedoms, government control, 2nd amendment rights, and sportsman rights that is always stripped under liberal policy. The problem is there really is no place politically for most younger people. It's my opinion that most people &lt;40 have a belief similar to this "You do what you want, I do what I want as long as it doesn't effect each other. Protect you from me and me from you but not me from myself. I respect that guns are tools not things with a mind of their own and may or may not agree with ownership of them, and that people live in different ways (vegans, hunters, gays, straight etc) and can deal with that, but they shouldn't be allowed to strip my rights for theirs." And right now no politicians stands for that belief. The real young generation (reddit flooded) seems to be heavily influenced by expecting money to come from thin air, and that it really should be someone elses problem to pay for it. They have a misguided understanding of economy, and that flooding money into the bottom will solve the system (not that trickle down solves it either may I add; i'm a strong promoter of flat tax, and a realistic minimal wage which research supports of around 11-12$).

And that's why I would prefer lower federal taxes, that are focused predominantly on education and defense, leaving infrastructure (and even more spending on education) mainly to state governments. It seems to be the most clear way to satisfy people, and it allows people to invest more of their disposable income into things that they want to see happen.
Are you fucking kidding? Ever stepped into a blue collar job anywhere???
Do you always talk to people like they are morons? I'm an electrician (although now I'm in engineering of systems after working in the field for years).
Yup. I'm oilfield and the religious right makes it painful to be part of this party :/ might be swapping to Bern just because he is the closest thing to an atheist we get...

I'm just showing an example of something you claimed you had never seen.
I claimed I've never seen it and that I didn't believe it was a mass problem, not that it didn't exist.
&gt;I mean no disrespect to anyone

Ok

&gt;all that sky magic

Ok


Yeah, but then when I want to drive from Atlanta to Houston, if I had to rely on Mississippi and Louisiana to fund their highway system, I'd end up dying in a swamp.
I get that, and obviously there would have to be *some* sort of regulation from the federal government when it comes to infrastructure (along the lines of common core for education), the trouble is finding the balance between the freedom of choice and uniformity.
&gt; Does anyone else feel the republican party is focused on religion too much?

Yes.

I'm agnostic (maybe? I don't know. I don't think about Religion), and most of my friends are also non-religious and pretty conservative. Yet I'd still consider myself fairly socially conservative.  

It's mostly in rural areas and a few outspoken who make it seem overtly religious. 

They cannot alienate their base though. So even more secular people, like Carley Fiorina and Marco Rubio, must suck up to them a little.

But the media does portray them in a poor fashion, but that's what you get when you have a leftist media -- and the few popular rightist outlets only spew more Religious crap.

What did I just read? 
Irish republicanism is about gaining independence from Britain for the whole island of Ireland which America has already accomplished. It is not about a particular political ideology like conservatism or libertarianism, a belief in free-market economics etc. 

The party most associated with the Irish republican movement is Sinn Féin which would be described more as socialist though they   try to be all things to all people to acquire votes.  

For example they are accused of backing austerity in North while rejecting it in Ireland.   
http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/sinn-fein-backs-austerity-in-north-and-rejects-it-in-south-29990949.html

To give another example:   
I remember when some Afghan asylum seekers locked themselves in St Patricks church in Dublin to protest their conditions and Sinn Féin representatives came to the church to support them. Then when they heard the local Sinn Féin youth movement were coming up the street to oppose the afghans, they scarpered. This is Sinn Féin in a nutshell. 
I know what Sinn Fein and Irish republicanism is. I just wanted a Republican (american preferably) view about it.. i don't think you read my post :P 
There's no good reason to vote democrat this election. Can't bandwagon on "the first X" again, that ship sailed already.

The only decent democrat dropped out. (I really liked Lincoln Chafee, he was like the Billy Gharahm of the dems.) It's not to say this current batch of republicans is spectacular, but let's be real... it's going to either be Donald Trump, the Christian theocrat who played surgeon simulator competitively, or the shark tank lady.

God willing it's Donald Trump or I'll just vote third party. It's not like presidential elections matter anyway unless you're the electoral college, or a primary voter. (Make sure if you're  a primary voter to pump the Trump.)

My advise to voters is just to focus on electing decent state laws, governors, and judges.

[Looks like they had a temp spike for Trump.](http://polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TR130/type/smallest/filters/PARTY_ID_:2/dates/20150823-20160127/collapsed/false/spotlight/1) He is down from a recent high, but still way above everyone else. 
Exactly, in the last two weeks, he went from crushing all the others in the polls, to absolutely destroying them, and back to simply crushing them again.
Well then clearly he is in trouble. ;-p
Convicted felons cannot vote. The overwhelming majority of criminals violent or otherwise are completely apathetic to the political process.

You can tell this guy was a debator in college because he cares more about the form of a debate than the content.
Convicted felons can vote in most states...

29 states allow felons to vote without restrictions after they have completed serving portions of their sentences.  2 of those states allow them to vote and never remove their right to vote.

Only 11 states have the option to remove voting rights permanently, but it often depends on the crime more than the felony status.
The description I give my kids as to why I don't like socialism is this. Johnny works 40 hours a week at his job. Becky only worked 20 hours this week . This means Becky only made half the money johnny made. Because johnny made more money this week than Becky,  he is forced to give a portion of his money to becky so that they have both earned the same amount of money this week. Johnny worked hard for his money and should be allowed to use his money as he desires not for what becky wants it spent on. 


This is a misrepresentation of the facts. While it is true that some states reinstate voting rights after felons are released, most will not until after the probationary period is finished. Many felony sentences effectively bar voting for life.

None of that is really important though because you are examining a small set of statutory rules and not the effect of all the rules. 

An overwhelming majority of felons in the United States were denied voting rights in the last election. 
&gt;This is a misrepresentation of the facts.

Hardly.  However, your statement of "Convicted felons cannot vote" is certainly a misrepresentation of the facts. Only 11 states have any permanent voting restrictions and most of those are only for selected felonies.

&gt;While it is true that some states reinstate voting rights after felons are released, most will not until after the probationary period is finished.

This is why I said "29 states allow felons to vote without restrictions after they have completed serving portions of their sentences. 2 of those states allow them to vote and never remove their right to vote."

&gt;None of that is really important though because you are examining a small set of statutory rules and not the effect of all the rules.

Not hardly,  You made a blanket statement that is commonly spouted across America.  It is far more incorrect than anything I have said.

&gt;Many felony sentences effectively bar voting for life.
you left out "but only in 11 states"  

Only 11 states have any form of permanent voting restrictions at all.  ALL other states allow reinstatement or do not remove voting rights at all.

&gt;An overwhelming majority of felons in the United States were denied voting rights in the last election. 
Good!  That is what crime does. That is the punishment for committing felonies.


here's [the primary schedule](http://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2016-presidential-primary-schedule-calendar/).  Rubio might win some state on Super Tuesday, but certainly not before
&gt;Good! That is what crime does. That is the punishment for committing felonies.

The point is not that they should vote, it's that they dont. It makes Cruz's statement rhetorical nonsense.
geez, that's something even Trump might not say
"...truth is great and will prevail if left to itself."

Which is why addressing climate change appropriately is essential to any party that wishes to prevail.
&gt;A recent release by the State Department may serve as one of the most damning indictments of Barack Obama’s decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq in 2011

That's interesting?  Obama decided to withdraw troops in 2011?  I thought he WANTED to keep them there?

This is straight from the GOP website:

https://www.gop.com/debate-fact-check-obama-would-have-kept-thousands-of-troops-in-iraq-under-the-status-of-forces-agreement/

&gt;THE FACTS: "Obama Sought To Negotiate A Status Of Forces Agreement That Would Have Allowed United States Troops To Stay In Iraq After 2011." "Mr. Obama sought to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement that would have allowed United States troops to stay in Iraq after 2011.

&gt;THE FACTS: "Obama Wanted To Leave Several Thousand Troops In Iraq." "FactCheck.org notes that Obama wanted to leave several thousand troops in Iraq, but the Iraqis would have none of it.

&gt;THE FACTS: "Obama Also Wanted To Leave Several Thousand U.S. Troops In Iraq." "Obama also wanted to leave several thousand U.S. troops in Iraq



Isn't a more truthful parallel something to the effect of : "Johnny works 40 hours a week. Becky is disabled either from a car accident that crippled her, or a traumatic event that gave her PTSD that prevents her from being able to function outside of her house right now, and is unable to work in the same way as Johnny. Johnny and others like him are happy to regularly donate a small amount to help Becky, since she can't work in the same way. His help also helps her get medical treatment to get her back into a full working mode that she couldn't afford otherwise. Plus, if something unforeseen goes wrong in Johnny's life, his fellow Americans will support him as he works to get better too. "   I understand what your concerns are, but by being so black and white about it, you really are teaching your kids to think that anyone who is unable to work for reasons outside of their control, must be lazy. That's just... bad.

For the same job? No. That is not to say they are equal. The Department of Labor puts the gender wage gap somewhere between 4.4% and 7.1%. While not the only factor, gender discrimination is a factor in what is an implicitly unfair practice. The racial wage gap for blacks and Hispanics is somewhat larger and more dependent on discrimination. Discrimination in the workplace is already illegal, so the proposed wage equality laws would be largely symbolic anyway. 
I so agree on Chafee. I was watching the debate when he answered that voting question. I really felt bad for him there. Being an avid follower of politics  i get what he meant and it was a wholly truthful answer.

Whole Truth doesn't help you much in politics.

If he would have phrased it better along the lines "i had just entered the legislature, the party as a whole was uniformly behind this bill. In order to ever influence congress it requires working together. I could have voted no, it would have made impact whatsoever on the passage but then i would have ostracized myself for being a junior congressmen brazenly ignoring the party."
There's a giant divide between having a social safety net like Social Security Disability and socialism.

The first analogy is accurate, your analogy is faulty.

I am not aware of a single politician (as in holds office presently/this decade) in our country that has ever advocated for the elimination of SSD.
You're grossly misrepresenting the reality of how social programs are portrayed by the vast majority of republicans in the media, politicians and otherwise. Something like universal healthcare is exactly what I'm talking about in my analogy, and is ignored in the one I replied to. And universal healthcare is exactly what is, over and over, labeled as "socialism". There are in fact hundreds of politicians in our country who hold office presently and in this decade that are directly against universal healthcare... and I don't believe its odd to think that  opposition to guaranteed health care that doesn't bankrupt you, just on the basis of it being "socialist",  is insane.
When you only include 2 people in the equation, then it does skew the picture quite a bit. 
Say you have 100 people. Let's assume an unemployment rate of 5% since we're close to that now. Let's even assume that not everyone makes the same amount:

10 People make 100 credits   = 1000

50 people make 50 credits   =  2500

30 people make 20 credits  =  600

5 people make 10 credits  =  50

5 people make 0 credits = 0

In a straight socialist system everyone receives the same amount of money, and in this case each person would get 41.5 credits. 
The majority cries foul because this has seriously hurt 60% of the population. This is obviously unacceptable. This is why you don't like socialism. It isn't fair.

The modern welfare system works more like this: 
The minimum amount of money a person needs in order to avoid literal starvation is 15 credits. As soon as you make more than that, you get no assistance at all. So, after taxes:

10 People make 100 credits   = 1000 -45 = 955   or 95.50 each

50 people make 50 credits   =  2500 -40 = 2460  or 49.20 each

30 people make 20 credits  =  600 -10 = 590      or 19.67 each

5 people make 10 credits  =  50 + 25 = 75         or 15 each

5 people make 0 credits  = 0 + 75 = 75              or 15 each


It helps out those people at the very bottom, but it really doesn't hurt those folks at the top all that much. They still get to benefit from their hard work.

So, here's the problem. 15 credits is not actually enough to live on if you also want to dig yourself out of poverty. If you want a job (or even a better job) your best bet is an education. You can't afford an education on 15 credits. You could get a low paying job, but you can't afford to get a job, because the childcare and transportation costs are too high. You are literally stuck with no way up. The result is generational poverty, and over time the ranks of the poor just keeps growing. This is the welfare system we all hate, because it doesn't really solve any of the problems we face. 

Then there is this slap in the face: Add one more person to the list. They make 100,000 credits and pay pretty much nothing in taxes. Now wait just a damn minute. There is no way they should be making that much money AND they get all the tax loopholes and don't have to pitch in like the rest of us.

And then you complain that "I can't believe we're paying all this money to people that don't even have a job. Those welfare queens are just bringing this whole country to ruin." To which I would say, "Seriously? Out of all the money out there (and we're up to 104,150 credits) you're crying about 75 bucks. Of which, your share was a whopping 20 cents. Woooo....don't spend it all in one place."


Here's the idea behind democratic socialism. 
Basically, keep all those parts in the Welfare system that keep people from starving to death. 

**PLUS+++** (for example)
**Minimum wage:** 

Currently, Mal-Wart pays its employees 10 credits. Through your tax dollars, you pay them an additional 5 credits. The owners of Mal-Wart get away with making YOU pay THEIR employees. So, how about we just cut out the middle man. Instead of the federal government using your tax dollars to pay their employees, they could just they their employees THEMSELVES! This is the craziest idea ever. I can't believe no one ever thought of this before. 

**Universal health care:** 

Medical bills are the biggest reason for bankruptcies in the country. This doesn't even just benefit the very poor. It benefits the middle class too. Do your taxes go up? Sure. Probably a little. Maybe not at all. But you're paying for health insurance now (or your employer is paying it for you). You're really not going to be out that much. In the long run, those uninsured folks drive the cost of health care up for everyone and you end up paying for it anyway with higher insurance premiums and medical bills. This pretty much makes the whole thing a wash. People are generally healthier and it doesn't actually cost you anything more at all in the long run. 

**Education:** 

What are the biggest obstacles to overcoming poverty? education and childcare. 
We can kill two birds with one stone here. Provide better access to quality early childhood education (this is also a big help to solving that generational poverty problem) and simultaneously provide child care to people while they work. Everyone benefits from this. It's a win-win. Unless you have a problem with sending little children to school? What kind of monster would deny children the opportunity to go to school?

Let me tell you a story,
100 years ago, my grandparents dropped out of school in the 10th grade. My grandfather got a good paying job, he was able to afford a nice house on the good side of town, they raised a family, and they all lived happily ever after. 

50 years ago (well almost), my dad went into the service and my mom spent a year in college. They both have good jobs, a nice big house in a nice neighborhood, they raised a family, and are still living happily ever after. 

Those are what we call fairy tales. Those kinds of opportunities: good paying jobs with little or no education beyond high school are really few and far between. They just don't exist in this economy. 100 years ago, we recognized the need for education beyond eighth grade and started funding public high schools. Now we have to recognize that a high school degree just isn't worth what it used to be. The jobs have changed. The needs of industry have changed. 

If people cannot afford access to education increase they're skills, then they just have no path out of poverty. It's another long-term investment strategy. You can have more money in your pocket now, or you can spend just a little bit providing better education for the entire country and avoid many of the costs of providing for the poor in the future. We're only as strong as a nation as our weakest link. The US is the richest and most powerful nation in the world, but for some reason we can't figure out how to solve something as simple as poverty. It's a failure, and it's sad really. Poorer and less powerful nations are tackling these problems head on and they're getting good results. Are we really saying we're not good enough to manage it? I've seriously seen comments in this thread that say the U.S. can't do it because we're *too* big.

**Conclusion:**

Unless you ever been out of work, or faced more medical bills than the total of your next 100 paychecks, you'll never really understand the plight of people who are just down on their luck. We're not talking about people who refuse to work here. We're talking about people who want to work, and because of events beyond their control, they are now about to lose everything. And why? How does that benefit our society or our economy as a whole? Why do we have to let people fall all the way down to the bottom when, if we had been proactive, we could have prevented them from falling at all. We don't have to provide all these helping hands and cushions for people because we think they deserve it for some reason. We do it because we're just nice, kind people who want to help our fellow Americans reach that American dream instead of being a bunch of selfish, unfeeling bastards (But we're Americans! It's our god given right to be bastards!). We do it because we believe that hard work pays off, so why not make sure hard work pays off. We do it because it doesn't just benefit the poor; it benefits all of us. We do it because we're rich and powerful enough to be able to do it. Other countries should be so lucky. 

The problem isn't uniform standards. The problem is that some states just don't have big enough economies to fund roads for people who are just going to drive right through. You won't hesitate to complain that the roads in Illinois suck, but you don't want to help pay for them because you live in Indiana, even though you regularly drive on the roads in Illinois. But if Illinois and Indiana and all the other states pool some of their money, then EVERYONE can have decent roads and you can complain about Illinois for some other reason. 
Well your analogy sucked, do better.

Universal healthcare is definitely socialism. You are a ward of the state both individual and employee. 

You should be afraid of the government owning anyone, let alone 15-30% of the US economy (healthcare sector)


&gt; and I don't believe its odd to think that  opposition to guaranteed health care that doesn't bankrupt you, just on the basis of it being "socialist",  is insane.

I'm definitely opposed to paying for your healthcare no matter what the label is. Get out of my wallet. I have my own family to provide for.

If Donald Trump becomes the president, or even the nominee, the party is dead.
I hope the dems keep this up. The independent voters are not stupid and hate being treated as stupid.
The only news here is that you think this is news.
Is it a front page story because it carried weight or authority, or because of lack of good sense.
Last member of GOP I supported for President was Mitt Romney.  Nice guy, nice background, nice family.  Had the intelligence, managerial skill, and executive experience that would have made a fine President.  But major differences on foreign policy (and with US foreign policy in general) made me fairly indifferent about him or voting at all in 2012.

Trump IS the worst thing to happen to the GOP, just as he's the worst thing to happen to the Democrats, the Establishment, the media, and the status quo and therefore quite possibly the best thing that has happened to America in a long, long time.
&gt; Last member of GOP I supported for President was Mitt Romney. Nice guy, nice background, nice family. Had the intelligence, managerial skill, and executive experience that would have made a fine President.

This is very interesting to me. I thought most Trump Supporters hated Mitt.

I supported Mitt in both 08 and 12 - but was holding my nose at the end... which surprised me. I was an ardent supporter in 2008 and the 12 primaries.

&gt;Trump IS the worst thing to happen to the GOP,

So you support him?

&gt;therefore quite possibly the best thing that has happened to America in a long, long time.

In what respect?
Don't want to answer for the guy but everyone I've spoken to who supports Trump (many are independent) does so on the basis that "things need to change and now. He's not beholden to any corporate influence other than his own. He's not afraid to speak the 'truth.'"

Again, not speaking for OP but it seems to me that people supporting him are fed up with the status quo and anything will be better than the current situation. Basically a nuclear option to go back to zero or something.

I might add that I don't think the people I've spoken to will actually go out and vote, anyways, though I think that's certainly not the case with OP.
&gt; (many are independent) 

I've felt that most either never voted before or rarely vote... but again, this is why I am asking.

I've yet to meet a supporter in real life.
Romney because the alternative was Obama 
When I say the worst thing to happen to the GOP I mean the Party elites, the establishment, the good old boys, etc.

Love him or hate him, Trump has, without winning anything yet, turned the whole system on it's head.  He's totally changed the conversation.

I saw a Trump bumper sticker the other day. 
I would like to invite all trump supporters to /r/trump, a subreddit I moderate.

I disliked Trump and found the entire concept hilarious. However, the more I read about him, and listened to him, the more it made sense to me. 

He does have some insane ideas like building a wall but you do need better immigration control. You do need to control and manage the influx of Syrian refugees. You do need someone who genuinely believes America is great and is able to portray that confidence and blind faith when representing America on the world stage.
&gt; the more I read about him, and listened to him, the more it made sense to me.
&gt; 

oh yikes, most people it would be the opposite.
Not true. He has an idiot playboy reputation. [I am not alone in changing my views about him over time.](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/126589300371/clown-genius).

Yes, I know what you meant.

&gt;Love him or hate him, Trump has, without winning anything yet, turned the whole system on it's head. He's totally changed the conversation.

I disagree. The Birther Movement (Another Trump Issue) is an old one. So is the "Just keep out all the muslims!" position.

He hasn't changed anything, he is just a rally point.
Ok - But you didn't really support romney, right? You do really support Trump (He isn't just "the alternative") right? Why? What is the difference?
I'm not  big fan of trump, im just tired of political correctness and the status quo. Atleast he has the balls to say what he means and sticks to it without pandering to the majority ala Hillary Clinton.


The last republican I supported was Rick Santorum who won my state by large margins. I voted my conscience.

&gt; Atleast he has the balls to say what he means

Like I said to another person who responded, I see this reasoning a lot. What I don't really see is "I believe in Trumps idea to keep out all the muslims" or "I believe him when he says he will deport all the illegal immigrants".

I find his promises to be spectacular examples of snake-oil sales, personally.

&gt;The last republican I supported was Rick Santorum who won my state by large margins. I voted my conscience.

Interesting. Is Santorum still running? Does he support trump? Thanks for your response.
I think u mean Trump is the best damn thing to happen to us.   We need to make America great again people
I encourage all here to [read this history lesson](https://www.hstry.co/timelines/a-history-of-immigration-in-the-usa)
Was that deliberate sarcasm?
With apologies to the Governator's 2004 convention speech: "If you'd follow your candidate out of the door, you are not a Republican."
There is very little party loyalty in the party's base.  Who gets to define what a Republican is anyway - the rank and file or the party bosses?  What happens if the two disagree?
If you're voting against the candidate nominated by the Republican Party, using the normal procedures of the Republican Party, in normal circumstances, I'm pretty sure that it's the party that one would be disagreeing with, not one part of it.
Hence the importance of running an above board and honest primary process.  The Republican party has not had much experience with that approach lately.
People vote. You can't get much more transparent than that, can you?
Tampered ballot boxes.  Tampered vote totals.  Non credentialed delegates voting at conventions.  Ignoring parliamentary rules of conventions to force predetermined outcomes on its participants.  Those are all crimes against the process that the GOP bosses have committed in the last two presidential election cycles.
I doubt that very much.
No. Been a republican my whole life and I love everything Trump brings to the table
The Republican Party is extremely lost. It is miles from where it needs to be.  It is the party of inaction. It has allowed Obama to reign terrible policy upon us.  It is ineffective and must be rebuilt. 

Also excuse me if I disregard the austrian's divisive rhetoric. 

If the republicans continue to ignore the mandate of the people I will vote for whom I wish. Party loyalty is so 1940s. 
That is a great resource.  For children. 

Also if anything you should learn that each and every group had to fight for their place in America. 

Welfare for half of all immigrants is the current disgrace of our nation.  Guilting Americans into accepting groups that possibly harbor terrorists or criminals is the new way. 

Hope and change.  If we knew he meant fantasy and delusion I think things would have been different. 
I can back up every claim either by personal experience, experience of associates as related to me, or news reports.  It would be a lot of information so lets just focus on one event - [dirty tricks at the national convention including the kidnapping of a delegate and a call for division on a vote that was ignored by the chair](http://www.freedomworks.org/content/romneys-rnc-power-grab-what-really-happened).
I support Ryan and am embarrassed by Trump. 
Oh my, cuckservatives are so disgusting. 
Ah; inadvertent, then.
&gt;He does have some insane ideas like building a wall 

negotiating positions.  You never start off asking for what you really want. 
Last member- Romney. I'm young, however. 

You really want to know why? Well, here's what I think in the form of a very angry open letter to the GOPe Cuckservative. I'll be happy to engage more rationally with your responses, but here's the gut.

I support Trump. Want to know why?

Well, here's my question to- the Bush/Dole/Romney "Compassionate" middle of the road Conservative.

What have you conserved?

**What have you CONSERVED?**

You saved *nothing* from the wreckage.  You're the Democrats ten years ago- and you crow that Caitylyn Jenner wants lower taxes, as if that means something. 

I've *seen* what America used to be- I grew up there, raised by people who helped build it-who bled for it, when that meant something. Who dig their dollars out of her soil. I've found it, intermittently, among small towns back off the main drag, with more grey hair than brown- places that make you realize Mayberry wasn't an ideal, it was just a reflection. 

I grew up on the ideals of a previous generation- about believing in God, and real freedom- hard, scary freedom. About taking care of America- her people first, her ideals first. Helping my nation, and my community- about doing *right* even when it was hard, about caring more about being a good person than a wealthy one, valuing morality more than pleasure, and living a decent life, in a small way- proud of my nation and my home.  All that Norman Rockwell shit.    

(Oh, I know it wasn't all like that.  But at least they tried to be.   When was the last time you tried to be?)

You abandoned every single moral principle, or social principle, or cultural principle our ancestors spent *two centuries* building the instant it could make you a dime.  It culminated in the Patriot act, and nakedly venal wars in Iraq, and the TSA, but it was a thousand thousand little cuts before that.

I don't care if Mexicans let you get rich on cheap tomatoes. I don't care if they built your houses real cheap.  I don't care if Chinese manufacturing gave you a fat little white collar job, or the NSA kept you safe.  I don't care that you stuffed your broken homes full of every transnational tchotchke Madison avenue could make in the sweatshops of Vietnam. 

I don't care about your astounding ability to recast every failure of your platform, and every fundamental betrayal of a decent society as "conservative"- that no-fault divorce is freedom, that social degeneracy is just the first amendment, that throwing in some BS about intelligent design is an education, that our dead churches are a free people's choice, that we're free to live in carbon copy suburbs where rootless people land for a moment before chasing the next spate of transnational paperpushing, that we can fill our empty cribs with mexicans and Somalis. I don't care that I can buy a gun to protect myself from the thugs you made in broken homes and broken schools. 

I don't care about your "middle of the road" anymore, and I don't care about your precious free trade deals and Yuan backed dollars while blue-collar Americans are ODing on Oxy just to escape the shame of nothing to do or hope for. And I don't care about social policies-we're far to gone to hope for any social conservatism.

What do I want?

*I want my country back, you son of a bitch.* 

Because free markets are the only freedoms you ever fought for- the fourth amendment is in rags, the first amendment means "Free Speech Zones," the fifth amendment is being waterboarded at Gitmo, the sixth amendment is languishing in jail, and the 9th and 10th are buried in a shallow grave with a headstone reading "Commerce Clause." But you went to the mattresses for the liberty of the Holy Petrodollar, by god.  

Society wasn't yours, you fools.  You were borrowing it from me.  And you broke it all to pieces so you could sell the shards off at a profit. 

Who is Donald Trump- you middle of the road, betray everything but the dollar, compromise on everything but the tax breaks, too big to fail, Free Trade makes us all free, Chinese slave labor loving, illegal immigration worshiping, no God but Mammon and pleasure is his profit, neocon, NSA, TSA, CIA, big dollar, big city, beltway *conservatives*?

In the best case scenario? He's one small step on the long road back. Someone who believes we can actually be what we were. But mostly? 

He's the man that makes you *squeal*. He's the reason your establishment bumboy is begging for change on the corner.  He's the reason your "Guns, gays, China, Mexicans, TPP, and Weed!" libertarian can't get his dad's vote. We sent you the Tea Party- and you didn't listen.  We gave you the Congress- and you didn't listen. 

So you get Trump. 

Listening now?

Maybe he's the last shout of the old America, the America I read about in the old books you never read. (Maybe it was just in the books- but at least they used to write about it.)

But if he's the last shout- he'll be a loud one.  And if I got one last shot- before it's all Aztlan and the welfare state, and tolerance uber alles,  before everything my grandfather raised me to believe is in a history book labeled "Sins of the Past"- *I'm taking you traitors with me.* 
&gt; very angry open letter 

Ok. Maybe I'll circle back when I have some patience. Thanks for venting.
Sounds like a easy way to hand Hillary a win.
Which is Trump's purpose in this race.
"Over the top," said Matthew Tisdale, a 27-year-old Republican from Metairie, Louisiana. "I don't believe we should ban everyone who is following the Muslim religion. That would completely take away from our stance on freedom of religion." 

The path of fear is a slippery slope. Where would this stop once we deemed this behavior ok? Who would we ban next? [Believe it or not, our system is already pretty good at vetting terrorists from refugees...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-t3GetV_Q) We shouldn't throw our constitution away because some people are afraid of ISIS.
There's nothing unconstitutional about not accepting immigrants and refugees from foreign cultures where views considered to be extreme in the US are *moderate*. 

There's an awful lot of fear coming from the *anti-Trump* side of this lately. There's plenty of precedent for this sort of thing. Liberal icon FDR did it, even Jimmy Carter did it. 

Our immigration policy should be designed to benefit the United States first and foremost, this means cultural compatibility and the value of the skillset of the immigrant are two factors that should be considered. 
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would have me think otherwise. "Equal Protection Clause requires states to apply the law equally and prohibits them from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or other arbitrary factors."

"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." -Benjamin Franklin
The people who wrote that  amendment went out of their way to say that it would not apply to Native Americans who wandered off their reservations and into the states and territories. If Native Americans who lived on reservations weren't covered what more foreigners from halfway around the world? 

No one is proposing a ban on the practice of Islam in the United States so using that Ben Franklin quote doesn't make much sense. 
You don't have to ban something for it to be considered discrimination. What is being proposed is a special religious category for immigrants. It's unequal application of immigration laws. The Ben Franklin was relevant because this discrimination (or violation of liberty) is being proposed as a means of keeping us safe. 

Not gonna defend the Native American thing lol. Not everything we've done has been good... that said, two wrongs don't make a right.
Who cares if there's discrimination? Not all cultures are equal, we need to put the US first and the idiotic ideals of "multiculturalism" should not be a big factor in determining policy. When it comes to our immigration policy we should discriminate against cultures where support of the death penalty for leaving one's religion is a *moderate* position. 
That's the kind of thinking that is scary. Honestly, I agree on some level. My gut says fuck 90% of the people that live in the Middle East. Motherfuckers won't even defend their own lands when invaded by ISIS when we're giving them US military gear and support...

That said, this immigration thing is the wrong way to do this. We need justice to be blind. Fuck multiculturalism. Undermining our stance on equality ruins what's supposed to be good about our country.
"Equality" isn't an American virtue, it's a virtue of the left. *Liberty*, not equality, is a traditional American virtue (and yes there have been problems with living up to that). Letting in large numbers of people from an intolerant, totalitarian culture where religion and politics are considered to be one in the same is antithetical to the notion of advancing liberty or equality. The vast majority of people from this part of the world are not compatible with our culture and should be resettled in their own back yard. 

As far as refugees are concerned we should only take in those who can't be resettled in their own back yard. This means taking in the persecuted minorities such as the Yazidis, Christians, and homosexuals and also some of those who have helped us in the war effort and who are no longer safe over there. 
I heard that from the crazies at first, but its actually sounding more and more plausible. No other race that I am aware of has been so overboard as this one.
I guess I agree for the most part. I just think the system we build for immigration needs *some* sort of way for those people to change their ways. 
Their people become radical Muslim before they're able to make decisions for themselves (the parents indoctrinate them). What if that young person later decides his culture is BS and wants out? I guess they'll just have to go to Europe first and prove themselves to the US? Just seems a little fucked up.
He's a populist progressive. Why else would he be seeking the nomination of a party that has customarily been thought a coalition of conservatives and libertarians?
We need equality under the rule of law. Not equality amongst individuals mandated by law.
I don't support trump but I do believe he will lose in the general election against Hillary.
I support Trump, and I think I can help answer this question. It's still early in the election cycle and all we're seeing is extreme reaction to his statements and journalists taking single items to the extreme.  But when we get to the GE and people can see him actually debate Hillary in person on a wide range of topics, it will sway in his favor.  This country has so many issues right now and there is so little trust in politicians, that it is going to take a Trump in office to actually fix things.  I think people are realizing that and that's why his numbers keep going up.  I think I also need to say that I support Trump, but that doesn't mean I have to agree with him on EVERY THING.  When I talk to people about him they always say "well what about this thing he said?!". We couldn't possibly find a person that everyone will agree with 100% of the time. In fact, I think it would be unhealthy for debate purposes if everyone in the party agreed about everything every time. But I'm looking for the best person for the job given the times that we live in.   
If we are indeed, in a [fourth turning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss–Howe_generational_theory), it's entirely possible.  Trump's popularity is entirely due to dissatisfaction with the establishment Hillary represents.
Thanks for your informative response.

To what extent would you expect Trump to soften some of his views if he gets the nomination? It seems like at the moment he's appealing to grass roots republicans to secure the nomination. Would he be savvy enough to then start courting the swing voters?
Thanks for the link, that's my first time reading about that and it sounds like we are in a fourth turning, but I worry if we're at the end of it or not.  I honestly don't think our country could sustain another term or 2 with the same policies and leadership we've had for quite some time now.

I'm not a Trump fan but I do think he could beat Hillary or Bernie.   Man those debates would be great.

FYI: There is also an /r/askaconservative sub-reddit
Yes.

Trump beats Clinton 55/45   
Trump beats Sanders 65/35  
Trump beats the other guy (O'Maily?) 75/25 
Sweet, more free publicity and poll bumps for Trump.   These idiots will never learn.

What poll are you looking at?  Hundreds of polls at this point have shown Sanders beating Trump in the GE.

These polls mean nothing compared to what will actually happen if the Donald is nominated.

No one likes Hilary, after she is coronated she will see all less frequent voters stay home or vote Donald as the edgy vote. Sanders wins and hardcore establishment dems stay home and independents break hard for Donald. Independents don't want socialism. The third guy, barely exists he only gets the anyone but GOP vote and dems stay home.

The number one thing you can depend on with dems is for them to stay home unless they get exactly what they want. The GOP will show up just to stop the dems even if their candidate isn't even remotely what they want.
Thanks for the link, it was a very interesting read. 
Bye! 
Hah! He saw all the attention Trump was getting over a similar threat.
most every Republican should leave...the party is virtually identical to libtard Dems...all about getting re-elected, paying off their donors and getting rich in office
Ben is a nut job, but if you get past the headline he is making a legitimate point.

&gt;“I am prepared to lose fair and square, as I am sure is Donald,” Carson said. “But I will not sit by and watch a theft. I intend on being the nominee. If I am not, the winner will have my support. If the winner isn’t our nominee, then we have a massive problem.”
I thought Freedomworks went broke.

Looks like they have friends with big pockets.

The Republicans are resisting any effort to invigorate their party.  

I believe those 2012 rules were mainly in response to Ron Paul's success.

Trump appeals to the most rabid right-wing of the GOP.

Trump will be the nominee, and defeat in 2016 is inevitable because Trump can't win in the general election, nor can a divided GOP.
I agree unfortunately, a 2016 Hilary Clinton presidency is looking unavoidable... Trump and his followers have hijacked the Republican party's name (largely by appealing to voters whom haven't participated in prior presidential elections). As a businessman, Trump is a master of marketing and it shows in the amount of media coverage he receives. It's a mockery of our political system, despite how masterfully he's doing it. 

Looking beyond the 2016 election, the idea of the Republican party splitting in two seems like a good idea. A moderate third party is what this country needs.

The far right and the far left are tearing us all apart. Their extreme views don't allow for compromise, it's a gridlock with no escape. It doesn't matter if Congress is super majority in favor of Democratic or Republicans, these last 7 years have shown us how broken our system really is. Nothing gets done because we're too divided. A nice moderate middle party (an independent party which people actually respect), is what we need.
Trump is not the far right
Trump is going to destroy Hillary once it's one on one.   He's right Hillary doesn't have the stamina. 

I'm not exactly thrilled with Trump either but given Hillary's record I don't she why people are handing her the victory. 
&gt; because Trump can't win in the general election

you're smokin' some bad weed, man

Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.

[deleted]
EKEEFE41, I think me and you share the same viewpoint in regards to the current state of this political party. People who are running as Republicans in this race are not really Republicans (The Republicans in this race are mostly RINOs and Neocons. One of those RINOs is Trump.). A lot of people have said this. This is weird because when this race first started, I said to myself that the people in this race who are Running as Republicans are not Republicans. Since you never voted Republican before and you don't want to vote for Hillary, you might be interested in Rand, like iwascompromised said. You might like Rand because he is sort of a Libertarian (Libertarians are fiscally conservative and socially liberal; it's basically a mix of the platforms of both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party). I am a Ted Cruz supporter. Due to the race having a lot of RINOs and Neocons, I found it difficult to choose a Republican candidate to vote for (I am a Conservative Republican.). Ted seems to be the only candidate in the race who has a platform that agrees with my viewpoints. Also, Trump likes to filp-flop (One minute, he will say that he is in favor of something but the next, he will say that he is opposed to it.) and he donated money to the Clinton foundation. Trump is not a Liberal on some things and I agree with the things he is not a Liberal on but due to him being a flip-flopper (and having Liberal views on some topics), I wouldn't vote for him because doing so would be a risky decision and I would basically be voting in another Obama if I was to do so.
Damn true.

Also I don't believe this was anything more than a tool for self promotion.. He has simply tapped in to too many ignorant people and now thinks he can win. 

His stance on immigration for me is fucking retarded... How can any "free market" person be against someone moving in order to sell their labor. It is literally the invisible hand in action.

Honestly, if someone supports him I think they are a racist or dumd.. Or both.
Thank goodness elected republicans can stand for something. 
Honestly "diverse" votes mean nothing.

The election is entirely decided by white women. 

If white men would vote in a bloc the same way as black men, white men would singlehandedly pick the national candidate (assuming even a few wives would vote with their husband).

You're an idiot
Source?
Sounds like a delusional white guy speak and a big reason why the GOP is failing.
They assume all "diversity" groups vote as blocks and that they just need to find the right "block" to make them viable again.

Sorry guys but it's a lot more out there than just white women you need to get to vote for you to win. 

Until you realize that you'll be winning locally and losing nationally for a long time to come.

I'm still trying to see where it defines what a "class" of people is.

By this reading does the President have the authority to say that black people aren't allowed in?
what a loser.  CNN is in the business of making money Chris, not being a shill for your lame campaign.
Not that the comment you responded to was all that brilliant, but you're talking about a party that controls both chambers of Congress and the majority of governor's mansions, just for starters.  A party that lost the 2012 Presidential election by 4% of the national vote, that lost Florida (and its 29 electoral votes) by less than 100K votes.  

The Republican party is not the hopeless crapfest you'd like to characterize it as, even if it's actually somewhat democratic compared to the Democratic party.  And so long as you don't realize that, your party will continue only winning when a demagogue can make people without any interest in politics show up at the polls once every four years, but s/he still won't be able to accomplish anything s/he promises.
Hell of a question that nobody bothered to address. The republican party is fractured between those who want a smaller government and those who want government to act in Christianities name while also paying it's bills on time and on budget. 

The religious right gained a small voting majority in the late 80's and has had a foothold ever since. Not a majority of the right in real numbers, mind you, but a majority in those who decide on candidates simply because they are better organized then us laissez faire conservatives, but this Major, minority really knows how to "get out the vote" making the minority a majority of early voters and a large minority of general election voters. They decide primaries and such for the most part in some states that vote early for candidates and as such decide who makes it past the first couple rounds and who drops out. So it is at any republicans peril that they don't at least pander to them and in election years do what they beg.

I don't like it, it makes us look like idiots when the truth is these ultra religious voters are only a minority of our side, kinda like the insane socialist and commies over on the left but like I said, they make sure to vote so to ignore them is to ask to trail in polls and not even be a part of the deciding debates. More unfortunate is the fact that commies and socialist are starting to get a strong foothold on the left. that is scary as hell. If Bernie would read one economics book or even a history book I am positive he would take himself out of the debate and renounce his entire being.

Just my opinion but I feel it is accurate (if not feel free to offer proof, not negs), I'm sure the jesus crowd will take exception. Personally, I would love for the government to be small in all areas, not just economic matters and I disdain religion mixing with politics. The best government is a local government where the representatives have to live in the community and look the disenfranchised in the eyes, something federal government electives haven't had to do in a very very long time.

How great would it be to have democracy via a constitutional republic on a county level (Jefferson's dream for our nation) with a federal government that is restrained to the directives of the constitution and bill of rights. A dream only at this point I am extremely sad to say.

How great would it be to be able to vote with your feet, where a government that fits your ideals could be as close as the next county over. Never gonna happen. We lost that battle over 100 years ago. Now it is majority rules and the fact is the majority of citizens can't be bothered to investigate and educate themselves on the issues. As a country we keep voting for the same failed politicians offering the same failed policies and programs that will simply continue to fail all the while gaining larger budgets for their failures each year.

So now we have to court these people who feel like governments job is to spread religious thoughts when really the federal governments only job is to make sure one state doesn't declare war on another and that no other country invades us. The alternative is we turn on these right of center voters and fragment into three parties with the left having the clear majority. Sucks for us.

So should the right tell them to get lost and lose every election because of the fracture or should the right embrace these zealots and have a fighting chance against the oncoming communist herd? Principles versus the consequences of reality. A hard choice for sure but I'll side with the religious right over the godless commies and the "drink my beer before they drink their own, eat my bread before they eat their own" socialist every time.

Did that answer your question? 

P.S. We certainly have people on the right running for president right now that are conservatives in all fiscal matters and much more liberal in social matters then you have generalized. If you are sincere and like the idea of not going into debt while allowing the maximum amount of freedom socially, I would recommend you vote for one of them. 

Unfortunately it seems at this time the media has pigeon holed people into voting either for their freedom of doing what they want while not harming others or their freedom to not live in a bankrupt country that will make despotic slaves of their children. I'll err on the side of not going bankrupt and retaining some form of a constitutional republic over socialism and lack of individual freedom in all respects over just some respects for the time being but will keep a close eye to make sure it doesn't go too far off the rails. I will literally defend my country by any means necessary before I allow Sanders to control my life and my progenitors lives from cradle to grave. I'm not worried about Hillary, she'll drop out before she gets a life sentence I imagine. Way too many skeletons there.

That is the real travesty, our false narrative. Go left and make sure that you don't get arrested for crimes that have no victim or go right and make sure that we remain a mostly free country but with a religious control that is entirely un-american. We lose either way. Good people exist on both sides but far too few. I fear that our country will have to experience the pain of socialism before we wise up and revolt for a government more matching what we had long long ago. We as a country have already accepted soft-socialism as reality. Governments go in cycles and the pendulum is swinging so far left right now that we will have 3 or 4 generations under the boot of the federal government before we wise up. Get wise now, vote with your heart and knowledge, vote republican. 

Patiently awaiting your reply,

Policeman Butters 
I wanna go to space camp....
The hardest part in big government is undoing anything. Once the power, or money in most cases, is there, it's almost impossible to remove it because there is some dependency created by its availability. Voting for bigger federal policing agencies isn't exactly the same as expanding Medicare coverage, or extending unemployment benefits, but it is often taken in the same vein because the vehicle for creating this expansion is usually a rider amendment that goes relatively unnoticed when the legislation is being voted through congress.

At this point, it has the feel of being past the point of no return, and like butters said, we might have to live with it for a while before enough people come back towards the middle. The only thing you can do is voice your opinion with your vote, and by contacting your legislature. One person won't move the needle much, but enough people pushing can create momentum. 
Let's start with the westboro baptist church... That would be a great start
Could mean they got screwed, but more in the 'unfair' light rather than... rape... That's a pretty extreme equivocation imo 
Go look at the 2012 election results. Look at the outcome if white men voted 80% or 90% for Romney. Look how far you can push down the white women vote when it's at 80 and 90.

Next look at white men. Look at how many % you have to shift from Obama for Romney. IIRC it was around 5-10%

Next look at the "diverse vote" take 100% of it away from obama and look at how Romney doesn't win or barely won.
Agreed.
If you do not believe climate change is a hoax, you are not a Republican. Enough said.
GOP are at the forefront of the energy revolution. Investing in clean energy in the private sector is way different passing the buck (and risk/responsibility) on to the government. 

BTW, my former Governator, how's your hydrogen fuel cell Hummer H1 doing? And what ever happened to your plans to turn the 5 into the Hydrogen Highway? ....oh Tesla built a desirable electric car and a private network of charging stations? I see how well you and your government planned that. 
I belive it's supposed to mean a specific class of people who could do harm. So, for example, s/he could ban Africans suspected of having Ebola. So the class of people here would be humans with ebola, but this would be mostly people who were black.
Thank you, for the response officer. We don't know Sanders would ruin the economy, I also don't want to go into debt I have perfect credit a good job and work hard coding sites people use every day, I workout and am in good shape I am far from lazy. But civil liberties and an overall liberal mindset are important to me.  I can't deal with assholes and religious nutjobs I would rather deal with whole food douchebags and hipsters tools any day. Weed is much less dangerous than alcohol, but the insecure aggressive get'r done republicans knock back the whiskey at a rowdy bar kick some ass then throw Willy Nelson in jail. I have seen the opposite of what I call freedom happen under republican rule in my 33 years on earth. I do appreciate your reply but think you may not see that. I want less prisons and more schools, and yes food not bombs.  

 I love the republican vision of smaller government, but don't see it at all in reality, definitely not with any of the frontrunners.  currently I see the best option as being libertarian, and democrats as the lesser of two evils.   But Any republican frontrunner would make my day to day much more stressful, along with the majority of americans aside from the .01% who can buy their way to freedom no matter what. 

I think you are fantasising about some republican ideal that does not exist. Anyone close to the ideal that you are describing has no chance of winning, currently the collective republican thinking is made up of witch hunts, science denial and macho anti-intellectualism.  No thank you. 

TLDR. People over prisons. I just can't afford to be locked up over occasional recreational drug use, it comes down to that. I can't lose my job.

To tell you the truth I am looking forward to this "socialist" revolution that we both see happening, I think it will be a time of prosperity for the country. Lets meet back here in 8 years and see who's right taking all factors into account, violent crime, health and wellness, prison population, employment rate. 
lol troll
With this being a Republican sub, please keep in mind that while the video does begin with talking about right-leaning pages, it does switch to Democratic/left pages at the 5:30 mark. I hope you are able to enjoy the video, and thanks for watching.
As a bernie supporter I come to this sub to view things from the other side of the spectrum. That being said if it were between Hilary and Trump I would begrudgingly vote for Trump, as would many other democrats. Hilary is more of the same, and I think we can agree that the majority of voters this election period are rallied around the idea of change.
So, you're voting for the candidate who can institute the most dramatic change, and not the person who most closely aligns with your ideals?

Because Hillary is much closer to Bernie than Trump is. Trump is a wacko who will get us mired in another foreign war.
I hate these facebook pages, it let's stupid people think that they are political active and intelligent and it slowly just sucks others in.
Yep. They aren't helpful to anyone other than the few admins who profit from article clicks for ad revenue. And it's debatable but they likely do harm by presenting nonsense into a world trying to make sense of things.

Maybe not to a woman.

This is as stupid as republicans themselves 
I'm not entirely sure about that. Hilary supported the Iraq war, that shows extremely bad judgment. Trump was against it. Now she touts her stance against it. In fact there are a slew of issues she was against that now she is suddenly for. How can I trust that she believes in any of the issues that I care about when she has shown time and time again that she will only care about what is popular? 

I understand Trump not an ideal candidate but I find him more straightforward and honest than Hilary. Again that doesn't make him an honest person, just *more* honest than she is.
Trump has already pledged to start bombing ISIS in Syria. If he does that, we will most likely be in another proxy war with Russia, and wasting trillions of dollars.
Probably, if there was some reason black people as a class caused a threat to the US. I can't think of what that could be. 

It sounds like you are race baiting to me.
&gt; Is Trump really that popular

yesSIRreBob
He is clearly in front right now.  A lot can change by the end of the primaries but there is no real momentum for anyone else.  I think people are really wanting a change (not just party but a non-politician).  It maybe what we need as a country to shake things up.

What are the odds of him winning if he goes up against Hiklary or Bernie?
This is how you brand clean energy. Something as renewable and independent from shady foreign sources.

This is irrespective of ANY climate impact, clean energy is good for everyone. Conservatives can get behind it, as well as liberals. Intentions may be different.
There's a chance he could become the Republican nominee but I don't see any chance in him becoming elected. He's too divisive to get people on the fence to vote for him. Either you love him or you hate him. Even if most Republicans end up voting for him for President it's unlikely enough independents would be willing to vote for him.
would kill bernie, less sure about clinton
As a Republican, I can't stand Trump. I want a statesman. I don't want someone who will merely lodge ad-hominem attacks on world leaders and call Angela Merkel "ugly" if she disagrees with him. There's absolutely no way I'm supporting him for president if he gets the nomination. I may just vote for Gary Johnson, the libertarian. 

Being an "outsider" or a "non-politician" does not automatically qualify you for the job of the president. I am the leader of a local Republican organization, and I fear I'd have to step down if Trump gets the nomination. I just refuse to be associated with him. 

Personally... I'm all about Marco Rubio. 
I don't completely disagree with what Obama wants to put out but I do believe that he does not have the right to work around the system that was put into place to keep powers in check.  If Obama really wants this done he needs to find a way to get it through Congress.
All we had to do was read your username

I hate these kinds of personal, childish, attacks on things that just don't matter. And I'm no Rubio supporter. 
Pretty good.  Bernie has no shot (he is way to socialist)
Hillary's legal problems are not going away.  Plus she is hard to like.
I think Rubio has a chance and seems to be gaining momentum
Pretty convinced the government wants to change as little as possible and get as little done.

Bill to repeal obamacare has some support - tie it to defending planned parenthood.  Sure that will really win over the in betweeners

They just live the constant stalemate
GOP focuses on these non-issues because they have no substance when it comes to real issues.  Other than cut taxes on the wealthy and increase their freebie subsidies.  AFAIC the party deserves Trump as the frontrunner.  
He'll probably win but if he's against Bernie he will get clobbered.  People need to read up on history and see just how fast Socialist movements can rise up and take over.  Socialism already had more support than ever in America's history and that was before Bernie ran and mainstreamed it.
Kinda feel bad for Rand, personally.  He tried to take his father's mojo and make it more establishment-friendly to win, at the exact time when being establishment is a huge negative instead of a positive.  

Now, he doesn't inspire anywhere near the passion his father did from the young Libertarian movement, yet is still too Libertarian and non-interventionist for more mainstream Republicans to support.

Not to mention Bernie Sanders has successfully converted a rather large segment of Libertarians to his cause.

Rather sad to me because I see Libertarianism as the only thing capable of beating the rise of Democratic Socialism in the future.  Republicans simply don't know how to handle this movement, and will inadvertently strengthen it while trying to defeat it.  Republicans need to realize they are on the verge of being a minority, if they aren't already, and this my way or the highway attitude will result in them hitting the bricks.

JMHO, feel free to ban me if you like.
What a waste, the guy is done for. 
Honestly? If it were Trump VS Clinton, then it'd be tough. We have so many people who hate trump, and so many people who hate Clinton. I couldn't answer that question. Trump VS Sanders, I'd say sanders would win. He doesn't have enough people hate him and he's kinda like-able. Trump has the Republican Party divided even to the point where some republicans have said they'd vote democrat if trump was the nominee. I would for sure say Sanders on that one. Although I would love to see Rand Paul become the nominee. As it would be capitalist vs democratic socialist.
Agreed with all of that. 

I travel a lot for work and was recently talking to a Australian couple who are in the states for vacation. They said if they lived here they would vote Trump, which really surprised me, I wrongly assumed most Australians were liberal. The woman said that PC is killing the US just like it's killing Australia and Trump is the only one who can do anything about it. 

They asked me who I thought would win and I said if not Trump then I would say it would probably be a Rubio/Kasich ticket.
Rubio for the Hispanic &amp; Catholic, which I think people underestimate just how large the Catholic vote is, there are around 80 million of us, I read somewhere that we are only voting group that swings so much between parties. I also read a couple of years ago that more Catholics are voting Republican due to being involved in pro-life causes, and they see Democrats as being the party of "death" I can attest to this one at least anecdotally. 
And Kasich cause we need to get Ohio
I will readily admit to being stupid. What is your excuse?
Why does it have to be a who?
Imagine hiring a guy to run a 5 star restaurant whose only credentials is that me knows how to make really good sandwiches. That's voting for Trump.

Now Imagine a guy who does the least work in the restaurant, complains that nothing gets done, is hated by everyone from the bosses to the dishwashers, and doesn't even like the food you serve. For some reason, you feel hes the best guy to run your restaurant, and you make him the owner. That's voting for Cruz.

The perfect no substance, lots of libel, that I have learned to expect from our candidate supporters lately . . .
How is this even a news article? There wasn't a single critique of his policies...
Democrats definitely have big problems, but for Republicans to jump for joy on this is pretty nuts considering what Hurricane Donald is doing to them.  I just read he's playing Born in the USA at his rallies now to taunt Cruz.  This is hilarious. 
Many of Reagan's policies were actually (at least in theory) very center of the road.  They helped the rich get richer AND the poor get less poor.  He at least attempted to do things that would give everyone what they wanted.  30 years out it's easy to talk about the ways that some of the policies didn't work (Supply side economics being notoriously hard to calibrate to the point that one of it's architects has since come out against it), but Reagan and his advisers peacefully (mostly) eliminated the single biggest threat to global security (The USSR), then quietly solved the next problem before most Americans even knew about it, by buying all of the old soviet nuclear materials and mixing it down to fuel grade so we could power our cities with the very weapons designed to destroy them!  Reagan accomplished great things for ALL Americans and while he was not perfect (no man is), his policies at least appealed to both sides and were backed by plenty of expert study.  No one (on either side) has that kind of plan.  Clinton tried from time to time (Though personally I give more credit there to his speaker across the isle, Gingrich), and early Bush II looked like he was going to attempt the same, coming out with a lot of early compromises until the entire conversation shifted after 9/11.  Now we have candidates on both sides that seem to take pride in pissing off whatever half of america isn't voting for them.  Reagan was not my favourite president, but you have to at least respect that the man was a president for all Americans, not just his own party.
But he's creepy hurr durr im a republican
in O-man's eyes, he's done quite well
Reagan happened to be president when the ussr collapsed. It is an insult to the revolutionary movements that actually toppled communism to attribute this accomplishment to him.

I would stop voting before i'd vote for a third party.

I want to say i truly wouldn't vote for Christie or Bush if either of them won, but with the Supreme Court Justice vacancies looming. I will vote for whoever has the R next to their name.

If Hilary appoints another Kagan our nation is fucked and a civil war will likely occur in my life time.
Many, if not most, legal experts say that Cruz is eligible to be president. Goldwater, McCain and (George) Romney all ran without any real concern. The Senate even passed a resolution affirming that McCain was eligible. 

It may be interesting to ponder but it seems highly unlikely that the Supreme Court wouldn't affirm a Cruz presidency if he was elected.

I don't think Obama believes that. He likely blames "anyone else but me" for it though.
&gt;would you vote for him?

Yep. He's the only one whose been consistently against vote-importing amnesty deals and further illegal immigration which would destroy Conservative politics in this country. (which seemingly would be no skin off the back of the current GOP leadership)

That he's also the only candidate to take an active stand against PC-liberalism in the culture war and actively refuses to give even an inch to the media scumbags doesn't hurt either.

&gt;are there any Republican candidates you'd vote for instead of him?

Sure, just none of the Neoliberal anti-Conservative candidates they've put forward the last few elections. 

Let's be clear, anyone who is even remotely liable of signing an amnesty deal is permanently off the list as far as i'm concerned.

&gt; I don't think Obama believes that

a whole lot of his SOTU speech was a list of "accomplishments" like the economy (wonderful), Obamacare (great) and national security (best ever).  yea, he believes all that
&gt; Donald Trump is actually right about something: 

usual WoPo trash
Yup. We didn't have a president who was born in the united states until Martin Van Buren, who was born in 1782. The whole wording of the natural born citizen thing is just a weak argument. 
The economy is bad? Obamacare is failing? We're not secure? Please explain.
I don't understand why any of the top three (Trump, Cruz, Rubio) are popular. Trump is charismatic and a celebrity, so that's working in his favor, but otherwise he doesn't really say much. Cruz seems shady and extremely condescending. Rubio sounds like he just scanned the headlines and looked for keywords to spout out during debates. 


Help us understand.  
What does it truly mean to be a republican?
So which one is it?
If you support Amnesty or Jeb Bush then it's the Spanish one.
When X  comes out on youtube saying that he or she supports the right to bear arms it's  because X's friends are strongly anti-gun.
Such as " A woman defends her right to keep and  bear arms. " 

It's this very reason why the JPFO exits in the very first place. If you look at the voting history of Jewish Congressmen you will find that they're overwhelmingly anti-gun.

Homosexuals are the same groups of people who deliberately track down a Christian business and then sue them.

If you take a random woman or homosexual off the street they will say that they support melting down all assault rifles including your 30,000 transferable  machine gun.

Typical republitard response. 

I'm in the thread to witness the idiocy. 
&gt; Oh, so you can't back up the claims

just one tidbit for the clueless = you

market is crashing down ANOTHER 400 today, Walmart is laying off 16k and closing over 200 stores.  that's just today, but that doesn't matter, you don't read anyhow
Cruz is one of the few candidates promoting smaller government. I'm between him and Rand for the primary.
Didn't he also say he wouldn't allow those with US passports, those citizens who simply crossed outside the border, to not be permitted reentrance? I think that surpasses what is meant by *immigrant*.
He got Bin Laden.
Ugh.  Give it up rand.  I enjoyed some of his views, but at the end of the day he's a little pissed off know it all.  
Flavor of the month. As for Rubio not being popular is because he's a Cuckservative establishment shill.
geez, what an ass.  liberal progressives and commies are the enemy shithead
Any arguments? 
Compare the policies of Trump with those of the commies: 85% overlap. 
[removed]
oh my, DT a commie.  who knew?
Functional illiterate! 
I said *his policies*. 
Not sure. Lets remember, this same thing actually happened at least once before. During the Iran hostage crisis, then president Jimmy Carter baned all Iranians from entry to the United States.
Yup. He's not quite nutty enough. 
I like Cruz and wouldn't mind if he became the next president 
You really believe Obama is responsible for the market and Walmart? If a Republican was president right now the same things would be happening. And actually the economy is better. I'm not saying it's because of Obama, but for most people it is much better. Construction is way, way up. I see it everywhere. House prices are rising. Evidence of a better economy is everywhere. The unemployment rate is at it's lowest in years...many years. That's not fiction man that is fact. Just because Walmart is getting hurt by increasing internet sales (Amazon) and the market is responding to China's problems, doesn't mean the economy isn't improving. The whole buying online from web only companies is a sign of the changing times...not a bad economy, and it's affecting all brick and mortar stores. A lot of people have a lot more money to buy things. Why...better economy. They are just changing how and where they buy. You've got a lot to learn. No I'm not a Obama lover, I just have eyes and common sense. 
That didn't extend to US citizens reentering the country. Only Iranian citizens would be barred entry. My understanding is Trump would not let US citizens return from abroad if they were Muslim.

*edit: a word*
How bad must his funding be if this is considered an acceptable ad?

Probably fan made. 
you're delusional or have been duped, e.g.

&gt; The unemployment rate is at it's lowest in years...many years

the Obama number is hacked to show low because of the calculation...people said not be looking for work are not counted.  the true unemployment rate is probably 17%

[labor participation rate is critical](http://www.businessinsider.com/lfpr-falls-to-lowest-level-since-1978-2014-5).  note one quote "The unemployment rate is **vastly** understating weakness in today's labor market"

lmao no
As a Texas demo, that is to say a conservative demo, I agree with much of the article. Although, feel like it can be applied to Republicans also. 

Also, I feel like because more Republicans tend to practice religion more than Democrats, they are more likely to treat politics religiously simply because religion is more likely to permeate the rest of their lives. Like the article says, most Republican voters tend to be Christian. The mission of Christianity to is spread.

All in all I feel like a these these downside are applicable to both major parties.
What's hilarious is that I see the other side of this!  The Vicious Right!

But I actually think it is a symptom of people taking everything their opponent says to the ridiculous extreme.  

If I make them seem extremely ridiculous, then I sound more reasonable, right?

Every time I have a discussion with my father (he's right leaning, and I'm left leaning . . . I guess), he takes everything I say to the extreme.  Then I have to point out that the extreme he took it to is ridiculous, and we need to find the happy middle ground.

Then we agree, until he starts watching those extreme Right shows again, and takes everything the Left says to the extreme.

Which makes me think the Left is doing the same:  Taking everything the Right says to the ridiculous extreme.
All too true. You say it's sprinkling, only to have people running for higher grounds almost instantly. 
No. Next question?
The fact that they're terrible people, with terrible ideas.
If you switch mentions of conservative and liberal in this text and stick it on salon it would all still be true. There is vitriol in any extreme. If you want to restore civility to discourse we need a lot less "look at how awful the other guys are" and a lot more thoughtful listening. 
Agreed, fully!
FTA:

So deep is the dislike for him in some quarters that people like Mrs. Cleveland’s husband, Doug, question the accuracy of polls that so consistently identify Mr. Trump as leading the field with around 32 percent. “I’ve never met a single one of them,” Mr. Cleveland said about those said to be backing Mr. Trump. “Where are all these Trump supporters? Everyone we know is supporting somebody else.”
These are the same people voting for the terrible politicians that have gotten us into this shitpile of a situation over the last 30 years.  

Jeb supporters...go ahead.  See if anything changes.  It would be more of the same ignoring the people and back room deals for lobbyists.  If Jeb was able to actually make a single decision without being told what it was by donors or controllers I'd be amazed. 

We need to take this party from the baby boomers that continue to fall for political double speak and empty promises. 

Go ahead and purse your lips Mrs Cleveland.  Your views and decisions have failed an entire generation.  
[deleted]
You didn't respond to my point.  You made your own, albeit valid, point. I'm gen X.  My parents are in the same group as this article and have the same view that trump is kind of rude and rough.  It's time for change and the tea party hasn't done it.  My parents and baby boomers in general are the voters keeping Trent lott and Tom daschle in their positions.  

Therefore the baby boomer and senior generation continue to be the problem.  They need to recognize that their choices have resulted in politicians that don't do shit, and trump can revitalize the party. 

Millennials are an entirely different and even more toxic problem but that has nothing to do with the article. 
&gt;And they worry that, at the end, all he will have accomplished is the destruction of the Bush family brand.

I feel like if he can't get at least close to a nomination then there wasn't much of a Bush family brand to begin with.
only Trump and Cruz are worthy of ink at this stage

Just remember, whoever gets nominated, it's critical that you back them so we don't end up with Hillary.
I don't support either party. I'm a social democrat who supports Bernie Sanders.
Sanders still hasn't come out with a plan to lower the deficit and pay for all the free stuff he promised. If he wins the election he is going to be standing in front of the press complaining how congress wont pass any of his bills. Boo hoo!

First of all, I don't care if we can pay for it or not, it simply needs to be done for the good of the populace. Second, Democrats have always been better with the budget; Bill Clinton had a surplus and Obama has lowered Bush's deficit from $1.3 trillion down to $474 billion. The biggest chunk of our national debt has come from that war we never payed for, which was actually a bipartisan blunder. Bernie has laid out clear plans for how he will pay for his programs, and you owe him at least a chance to make good on his promises.
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing. Bill Clinton had a surplus but it was not caused by him raising taxes on the wealthy. Newt Gingrich worked across party lines to pass a budget to restrain deficit spending, Bernie wants to increase it, which netted a surplus along with lowing capital gains tax, again Bernie wants to increase capital gains. I owe Bernie sanders nothing. His plan is to tax us all more and give the government more control. The country gave Obama and the Dems their chance to make "chance" and we will see how fed up the US is in the election.

Oh sorry, all those countries are more socialist than Bernie Sanders.
And Donald sitting out. Awesome. More air time for Rand.
I don't know republican who is upset that Trump won't be there. I, for one, am looking forward to maybe having some actual discussion about things tonight rather than endless questions about Trump and his smirking. 
&gt; Trump supporters who are unswayed, enjoy your mental masturbation and conscious censorship of other candidates.

That has to be the most accurate description of how Trump's moronic supporter base behaves. I'm really tired of hearing their bullshit rhetoric spewed everywhere. Trump needs to go. 
Its funny that the media and others in the GOP campaign have label him disqualified or not qualified, they all have their angle on the matter. The man is not a politician he is a business man. It's not a requirement that he does the debate. Megan Kelly is trying to further her career with the questions she has asked him, no one else is asked questions like they ask Trump. He is not going to play their games by going to the debate and already Fox News has been trying to get him back on. The same will happen when he is President he will not play the games that have been played for so long. There is a strategy in business called walking away.
Last night Trump went on the O'Riely factor. O'Riely asked him about the debate to which Trump responded about their agreement not to ask him about it made prior to Trump going on air. Fox News is like any other news network, get ratings, get a story, get views, etc. They all play the same games.
Trump supporters who are going to watch him say the same BS at his own rally have already made up their mind. They don't care or want to see Trump challenged by anyone else, they just want Trump to win and if his talking points are debunked at a debate they will still claim he won. His entire candidacy is about the spins and inflammatory statements, not facts or achievements. He built himself up by saying whatever will get him media coverage no matter how self destructive, if he stopped being so controversial he would surely drop in the polls. If people stopped paying attention to Trump he will implode, This post won't change much but if Fox News can beat Trump rally in views, I think that would be a serious blow to Trump, and then we will see another tantrum.
Trump is a business man who operates like a conman. He is a paper dragon who is 90% name recognition, all candidates get hard questions and Trump as the one leading the polls should have to answer the hardest questions to see how a president Trump would do under pressure. He backs out for a lame reason to exploit his strategy and give us less transparency, I don't know about you but I wouldn't trust a guy just because he says he can do it without giving even a coherent outline. As I said in a previous comment if you think this is strength then you have already made up your mind. The only game Trump is playing is with Trump supporters.
Same as any other candidate it is all online first result on Google. https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions

Plus the GOP debates so far are a bit of a joke. Seven candidates on the stage asking questions about what GOP candidate A said about candidate B. Bash Obama, bash Clinton, wash, rinse, and repeat.
His platform is basically "we're gonna fire everyone and revamp everything" there is no specifics in those plan much like everything else he says. The debates are a joke because of the stupidity Trump has brought, when did 'yeah ok Jeb' become an acceptable response to a clean debunking of One of Trumps 'plans'? No doubt there is way to many candidates right now but the point is to narrow them down. Once votes start getting in there will be a lot less and it seems like Trump doesn't want to risk that pressure.
According to most, he won all the debate . I am not interested in watching jeb and carson battle it out for 5th place.
Go back to NRO. Beltway Republican Cuckservatism is dead. Long live Trump.
Yeah he sure won.. Like when he was ranting about China and the TPP when China is not even part of it and parroted Ohio fracking despite the fact it makes up something like 2% of their revenue. Like I said Trump is about the spins. I watched every debate and the only one he may have won was the last one, Trump supporters block out all the times he showed complete ignorance 
Trump and Trump supports believe he won the debates because a majority of the online polls said he won. 

But if you want to nitpick details about the candidates, we can. Where should we start? Canada? Improper filing of financial forms? Heels on boots? Guac?



&gt;Trump and Trump supports believe he won the debates because a majority of the online polls said he won.

Bernie Sanders won Time person of the year. Online polls don't matter especially since lots of states have closed primaries and people wouldn't be able to switch parties in time to vote. 

Also your second point sure we can nitpick candidates. I'm sure there will be plenty of nitpicking at the debate tonight even without Trump, who fears being vulnerable when he's on top. There has been plenty of infighting that has nothing to do with Trump. 

If he really felt as strongly as he does about say immigration then why does he support them and pay them to work on his projects? He just says this stuff to get votes and media attention, doesn't mean he's gonna follow through with any of it.
&gt; Online polls don't matter

Nate Silver disagrees

&gt; who fears being vulnerable when he's on top

Has been at the top for weeks

&gt; If he really felt as strongly as he does about say immigration then why does he support them and pay them to work on his projects

You see hard working immigrants working manual labor and automatically assume they are illegal. Really sad.
I think this is in reference to how Republicans are anti abortion but more pro war and pro capital punishment. The insinuation is that the last two are death related and cancel the life stance of anti-abortion.

The rest is somewhat personal, others may add their two cents:

The argument for war is that it is a duty to country to serve. Wars prevent conquering of our lands and allies, preventing death and suffering of innocents. With our all volunteer armed forces currently, it is an informed choice made by an adult. 

Ditto for death penalty. It's a known possible consequence of performing a heinous crime that an adult chose to perpetrate. Yes, some say it's not a deterrent. Maybe not to the criminally insane that get the death penalty, but there are plenty of other people who are more able thinkers who change their ways when they think they might get ol' Sparky for their crime.

Tl;DR: Abortion is not a choice for the aborted. military service is a choice, and ditto for a life of crime. They are two different situations which don't equate. 
It's a rhetorical trick.  Take the language your opponent uses to describe their position, change the relative meaning of the words, and then use your altered meaning to attack their position.  The typical model is "If Republicans are 'Pro-Life', how can they support the death penalty?!".  The answer is that 'Pro Life' means, colloquially, opposition to abortion.  You can argue that there is a logical incompatibility between opposing abortion but supporting the death penalty, but that argument isn't made by massaging the word 'life' into a silly word game.
Who cares about Nate Silver? 

He has been on top but this is the last debate before the primaries. Last chance for him to fuck it up or convince Iowa voters he is the guy but he bails and makes petty excuses.


I know many legal and illegal immigrants. The guys on Trumps DC project admitted they were illegal. Trump would lose money if he hired lazy legal union workers. The illegals work 5x as hard and get the job done much faster 

[removed]
&gt;the illegals work 5x as hard

lol the noble savage. Listen, I'm not involved in your back and forth here, but illegal immigrants aren't gods of manual labor. Their only benefit is standing outside a church, or a home depot at around 7am. They're available. That's it, you have to literally stand a foot behind them at all times so they don't start fucking around an hour after starting a project, and before you even get them to the work zone you have to figure out which ones showed up that morning stone drunk. Don't kid yourself about work ethic among illegals, they count on being your only choice in the short term.
Completely incorrect. The illegals who stand in front of Home Depot are usually the problem illegals (alcoholic, unemployed, asshole, etc.), there is a reason that they work by the day and can't get steady jobs. The reason they are here is because the current policies in place are completely ignored, they don't even bother checking up on people or making any incentive for the to pursue citizenship. Most illegals work much harder than average americans for less money because they have no other choice, they usually pay property taxes and sales tax for years. Trump proposal includes deporting people who've been here working steady jobs for 10-20 years, without trying to enforce the current laws.
You keep making vague generalizations. I've worked first hand with all kinds of illegals. From my restaurant days, I knew a great deal of them who held a job for years at a time, and from my farmhand days I knew a great deal of them who stood outside a church, many of whom I would go on to form "crews" with as many of them often had friends who would also agree to come work. All of them, from both sides of the coin, were lazy unless you literally stood over them. Also, all of them were paid a fine wage. The church-sitters wouldn't leave the parking lot for less than $120 for a day's worth of work ($15/hr, plus you provide lunch) and the ones who'd been working in the restaurants for years often had a number of benefits/perks on top of their regular pay, which was generally between $11-17/hr, and much more so for people like head chefs.

The misconception that illegals somehow earn less money than if whites took the same jobs is completely inaccurate. They generally receive less money because they're often complacent with doing so, as they have more time to do what they want without fear of a cartel kicking their door in and ransacking their house. What further fuels their complacency is making "less" than the average american is still much, much more than they'd see in Mexico, or Guatemala, or Honduras, so they have no real incentive as a culture to pursue a greater income unless they become fully anglicized, including speaking English proficiently, which is generally something most illegal immigrants don't consider necessary. Some even consider it an affront to their own culture, and I was often in the presence of Mexicans severely admonishing Mexican-Americans for not being fluent in Spanish.
&gt;they have no real incentive as a culture to pursue a greater income unless they become fully anglicized, including speaking English proficiently, which is generally something most illegal immigrants don't consider necessary. 

This is the problem. These are the laws that need to be enforced that are ignored/not there, not a reactionary deportation of millions of people. 

The pay depends on the experience. Blue collar workers in the US are usually paid a lot more than illegals, also they do mule labor most Americans wouldn't want to do. 
&gt; Cuckservatism

This is how I know you're a child.
Have fun watching your party die 
It mostly has to do with social welfare. A single poor woman wants an early-term abortion because she can't afford to take care of the baby. Republicans being pro-life say, "No, any abortion is murder!"  
  
So the mother has the baby but needs to rely on government assistance programs to help care for the child. The problem is Republicans are always fighting to defund these programs (food stamps; etc.)    
  
Basically the whole pro-birth not pro-life rhetoric is saying a Republican cares about a baby being born but doesn't really care what happens to the child afterwards.

well now you know reddit is wacko wrong vs the America public

then again, that's true of most everything on reddit subs
How is voting for three of the most popular candidates 'wacko wrong'? Seems pretty cut and dry to me.
look who's on top.  elsewhere polling in single digits
I'd be voting for Fiorina, but you skipped her, so.
Sorry! I only put the candidates that were above 2% in recent national polls! I should've added an "other" section. 
Incidentally, the other side is acutely aware of this, so we should be too: https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/01/a-warning-to-warring-democrats-in-the-clinton-sanders-race.
If people are downvoting you for that, something's wrong with them. This is precisely right.
Ha! Rand Paul has been challenging him for half a year and still hasn't responded. 

Besides, if you're actually going to talk about the issues, what good is Trump?
&gt; The Democratic Party doesn't seem particularly interested in giving young people the kinds of real world opportunities that the Republicans have traditionally been interested in providing for them.

The Young Democrats of America do a fair amount of that sort of thing...

no changes needed.  establishment agenda on both sides = same
I think they'd be forced to become more centrist. If they propose three losing messages in a row they'll have to become more socially appealing. While the base won't like that they'll have no choice but to go along because they'll settle on, "no way I'm voting for the democrats"
what is centrist?  list 3-5 centrist features R should adopt and add in who exactly will see love then change their votes
I think if their core message was much more relaxed in terms of abortion, gay marriage, and immigration they would steam roll dems. I think America is largely libertarian at its heart (don't let the govt fuck with my money, don't let the govt tell me what to do with my body) and becoming increasingly more so every day. If they relaxed their social issues then They'd gain favor from moderates, and hardcore conservatives would mostly go along because they will not vote for a dem

My two cents
He should just drop out NOW, but he'll probably wait until at least after the NH primary. 
If you're talking about Sanders, he was explicitly told by the DNC if he took part in any non-DNC sanctioned debates he'd lose any future support from them.

Now I don't know how he would have responded had that not been said, but it had.
Its the same in both parties.  They will exclude a candidate for taking part in an unsanctioned event.  But realistically, I think the DNC would get itself in even more hot water if it excluded bernie.
Worth trying. Really.
Works on mobile. 
I spent way too long playing around on this
They don't fear the base voting Democrat. They fear them not voting.
Right, but do you think a dislike of their candidates is enough to keep them from not voting to insure the dem doesn't win?
Yes.
Do you have an idea as to what R's will do, or an opinion as to what R's should do, if they lose the general?
If Jeb somehow steals the nomination he's the only person i wouldn't vote for.

I'd vote for Huckabee over Jeb. I think he's insane in his evangelical views but atleast he's consistent and trustworthy.
Rand Paul was the only genuine and respectable voice on the Republican debate stages. The way he dressed down Christie's phony tough-guy stance on foreign policy as well as Rubio on the line of personal liberty was phenomenal. 
Interesting stat.  The establishment seems intent on their idea that Cruz and Trump are so polarizing that they couldn't beat a democrat in the main election, and we have to nominate Rubio or Kasich to get the white house.  This poll shows that isn't necessarily true.  Cruz was the MOST favorible!  I wonder what those numbers look like for Clinton.
I'm honestly not sure why he didn't get more votes than he did.  I had a lot of friends that respected his views and planned to vote for him.

I am relaxed on most social topics and would identify as a right-leaning libertarian.  However, I am VERY against abortion, and so are most libertarians I know.  I would never be in favor of the Republicans relaxing their stance on abortion.

There was a guy heckling Rubio today in NH as he was walking outside. The guy was in a cardboard box  robot costume titled "Marco Roboto"
Oh PLEASE is there video of this??
It was on snapchat. I'll look for it
I don't see the problem with corporate endorsements.

 Democracy isn't just a game where people who don't have wealth figure out how to take money from those who do. We endowed rights to people who form these corporations too, and so far, they're doing a far better job at keeping their money than people are doing of taking their money from them.


Democracy and capitalism are not one in the same
Fun fact: Non-sequitor is a kind of fallacy.

A lack of spine and testicles in the GOP allowed liberals to run wild. 
And thats why republicans are voting for Trump. Nice analysis.
I suggest you read this article, [Dear Barry Goldwater, From George Romney](http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2012/11/01/rethinking-george-romney/).
This is a bullshit inflammatory title.  
He's criticizing the Pope's planned visit to *the Mexican border*. The Pope has shown to be very political, and when he plans a trip to the border there will obviously be political messaging and rhetoric along with it.
slams? slams?  wtf?
Yes, he should. If this was the end of a republican term they'd be falling all over themselves to get a nominee confirmed. If they want to continue being "defenders of the constitution" then they should defend the constitutional power of the sitting president to nominate a justice and act like grown ups in Senate to vet the the nominee properly. 
can't we all just get along?

hey McCain, hey Graham, hey McConnell, help me reach farther across the aisle

...yea, that's how to roll
doing all that is just fine.  it'll just take a year or so to complete
It shouldn't. It would be a damaging blow to the GOP to try to drag it out. And then what happens if Hillary or Bernie gets elected? Of the three choices, if rather have Obama make the nomination. 
exactly who do you think Hussein is going to nominate?  an actual choice worthy of consideration or yet another wack job progressive "the Constitution is out of date" ideologue? 
Likely someone more moderate than Hillary or Bernie would. 
Trump!!!
I like how Trump tries to invalidate any criticism he receives. He loses in Iowa, he claims that Cruz cheated. He gets booed on stage, he claims the audience is full of donors and lobbyists. Trump lost this debate. The other candidates destroyed him, and the audience noticed. Blaming Bush for 9/11 is just foolish. 

I'm hopeful that the legitimate candidates will surpass him come the 20th. 
So, the argument isn't that it his duty to replace, but that you already know you won't like who he picks? Funny that you act like a constitutional defender.  

Admit it.  If Romney won, you'd expect him to appoint before his term is through.  

Just imagine Ginsberg dying instead of Scalia with Romney in office.  You'd be offended if a majority democrat senate said the exact same thing.  
&gt; you already know you won't like who he picks? 

Yup, that's right

wack job anti-Constitutional far left progressives are off my list 35 years ago, yesterday, today and forever
How do you reconcile with the hypocrisy that you want to deny Obama his constitutional right, while claiming that it should be done for the sake of preserving the constitution?
&gt; that you want to deny Obama his constitutional right

not at all

Obama's **right** is to **nominate**, no more no less
Obama is obligated to appoint a new judge.  The senate is supposed to consider and vote in a timely manner.  Republicans need 60 votes to turn the candidate down.  

The current plan is to drag it out for as long as possible.  The claim is that "the people" should decide.  Too bad that they already did decide in 2012 for who they want to appoint Supreme Court judges in 2016.  

If the plan actually works, then it could create a really good opportunity for Obama to take the bench.  GOP is very fractured and it can easily lose the next election.  Don't like Obama today?  At least you know he'll be gone in a year.  He still has a lot of life left in him and will be around as long as Roberts.  
When I take a year to approve something relatively simple at my job, I get fired. It doesn't take a year to vet a high profile lawyer/judge.
How is blaming bush for 9-11 foolish when it happened on his watch as commander in chief? It's not like they didn't know about bin laden or his people were up to no good. 

The guy sat there and read to kids as the attacks were happening looking about as unpresidental as possible. They went after bin laden by liberating iraq...which still makes almost no sense since he wasn't there.
George Bush wasn't the best president, but blaming him for a surprise terrorist attack because he was in charge at the time is foolish. 
There were intelligence reports stating there could be problems that were ignored.
Drop the social issues, like abortion and gay marriage. Its becoming more and more irrelevant. Become more understanding of minorities and gender issues, whatever they may be. 

Support capitalism and competition...such as maybe breaking up the huge financial institutions. Too big to fail = too big. There are anti trust precedents that have worked well in the past. Monopolies/oligarchies are bad for business. 

Actually take steps to reduce government spending, and not just limit it to welfare programs. What about defense and corporate subsidies? Cut taxes not just for rich people. 

Edit: Less fear mongering as well and advocating for more wars. They should just focus on economy and keeping government out of our lives (including in the bedroom).
He didn't blame Bush for 9/11. My God I'm new to this sub but it's turning out to be as cancerous as /r/russia.

This is why I believe Donald when he says Jeb!'s campaign is a sad story, truly sad.
Low interest issue.
I hate liberals.
I hate how they're always pushing a gay, or black, or immigration agenda. I hate how you can't say a word around them without their buttholes quenching. I hate how they constantly push women out of the house and into the workplace, breaking up millions of families (mine). I hate that they are so pro-abortion, that human consciousness and a soul somehow don't count once the fetus is being formed.
I hate how they try to act so progressive, yet they are really just fueling hate. 
You know my feminist friend actually said I was a SEXIST because I said I sympathized with Hillary being a women in Office? I said I heard The President tell a story about her, and she said, "Well you're only saying that because he's a man." WHAT!? Jesus. I'm all for feminism, but this is just feminazi shit. 
And the liberals just don't know the difference.

Hillary is being investigated by the FBI for having classified, sensitive emails on her private, unsecured server. Bernie is self-declared socialist. He wants stuff like free college. He also wants to tax companies (which means that they will raise their prices) the free college would not work since everyone can get a degree, then the quality of education would go down. So to summarize, you have a candidate who can not be trusted with private information, and a candidate who wants to give away our country and have the government take control of businesses, which I don't want the government having more power than they already have.
So I support Bernie, naturally my answer will be biased. 

The argument against Clinton is that she has a bad track record on voting (voted for Iraq war), flips her views to whatever her donor's interests are, and has several legal scandals. She also defended Bill against the sexual assault allegations and helped shame the girls filing the claims. I personally don't trust a single thing Clinton says. There's a long list you could go down for Clinton. But all you really need to look at is how her so called policies goals differ from the backbone of her campaign donor's goals. 

The argument against sanders will be he's a socialist and doesn't know anything about economics. He is a self proclaimed democratic socialist, he believes in socialism within a capitalist frame. Socialism is not a bad word, America benefits off socialist programs and aspects daily. You'll hear he is just lying to everyone and luring them in with free things and is just going to tax everyone but the yang. 

https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-bernie-pays-for-his-proposals/

This is site that lays everything out pretty nicely. He will pay for public education with a .5% tax on Wall Street interactions. The estimated needed to provide education is 75billion, the tax should produce 300billion. He will pay for single payer healthcare by a small tax that will save money by eliminating the middle men of insurance companies. He will raises taxes minimally also for 15 weeks paid leave every year so you can have family and vacation leave. If you make under 250k (per person) then taxes will not increase except for the single payer and paid leave, after 250k there is an increased tax. 

You will hear he is weak on foreign policy because he believes in drastically cutting back the defense budget and removing all the waste we spend there. His views on ISIS are that it's not our direct battle and it should not be our soldiers on the ground.  

You will hear he won't be able to get anything done while in office. Since right now it is majority Republican, this is correct. But he has been telling everyone since the beginning it doesn't end with him and that everyone needs to get out and vote for the congress elections. 
you must not pay taxes (or not much).  you must not pay attention to the taxes they propose on top of a totally stagnant economy that will further damage the American economy.  you must think confiscating other people's hard work and money for "goodies" to be distributed by politicians in exchange for votes is OK

I could type for hours like this

Headline sounds like he's dying.
His campaign has passed away.
His campaign was stillborn.
So you would agree then that our roads and national defenses should be funded and upheld solely by private entities? Because I personally really like those "goodies" provided by our gov't.  

In all seriousness, taxes DO benefit us as a whole. The line of reasoning you're using would lead us down a road of corporatism, not dissimilar to many dystopian movies and books. 
&gt; Because I personally really like those "goodies" provided by our gov't

government doesn't "provide" anything.  government taxes and spends

e.g. government didn't put men in space or on the moon.  tax money spend by government hiring thousands of private contractors did all that.  same for everything else...government = tax and spend
Too bad they had already set aside money for college.
This is simply not true. Governments built canals, roads, ports, and even hospitals to promote economic growth. The federal government built the Cumberland Road in 1811. It ran 620 miles (1,000 km) and connected Maryland to Illinois. The Federal government built the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (a plan which originated in 1754 with George Washington)and initiated by President John Quincy Adams in 1828. US merchants supported and profited from these internal improvements. None of these could have been funded or created with the Federal Government’s efforts.

What are we to make of Mr. Romney’s comments at the Salt Lake City Olympics?

ROMNEY: You Olympians, however, know you didn’t get here solely on your own power. For most of you, loving parents, sisters or brothers, encouraged your hopes, coaches guided, communities built venues in order to organize competitions. All Olympians stand on the shoulders of those who lifted them. We’ve already cheered the Olympians, let’s also cheer the parents, coaches, and communities….All Olympians stand on the shoulders of those who lifted them.”

The people as a whole pay in to a pot that is meant to be used to support us all. No one is saying that there is not room for improvement. What you are saying though is limited and short sighted. It fails to take in to account the larger picture. By your logic, If private entities do everything already, than why are modern businesses not thriving in places like Mogadishu or Western Sahara? They should be teeming with thriving entrepreneurs since there are no governments, taxes, regulations, labor unions, or any hindrance to free enterprise.
&gt; Governments built...

Governments built nothing

and for some reason, you don't get my point

**government has no money**

government must tax/confiscate workers' money to spend (workers' money) to contract for building

it's taxpayers' money, it's taxpayers' labor, it's taxpayers' brains, it's taxpayers' everything 
&gt; for some reason, you don't get my point

Oh, I see your point. It just holds no water. We give money to the government and vote on the people we think will do the best with that money to help with the betterment of our own lives and those around us. It's pretty simple. 

Saying you don't want to put into the pot but you want to use public utilities is pretty selfish. Saying the government has no money is essentially saying that it doesn't exist. You want to throw a blanket over it and pretend it isn't there, but it is .

I agree the guy's a douche, but this is bit inflammatory. Gotta get behind Rubio now.
"Trump is defying conventional wisdom!"
"Conventional wisdom says Trump will win!"

Can't have it both ways.  Trump is a very weak front runner with a high floor (30%) and a low ceiling (40%).  He lost support between NH and SC, and he underperformed his polling in SC as well.  He still could win the nomination, but it's not anything close to a done deal at this point.
I'm glad I'm not like you.
According to a recent thread on /r/politicaldiscussions every republican who has won NH and SC has become the nominee.

He's the golem of the GOP's own making.  Even Newt sees this now.  I love how he gets Republicans supportive of liberal positions by wrapping them in bigotry.  Trump's support says far more about Republican voters than it does about Trump himself.  And with Bernie Sanders winning over the youth to Socialism by huge margins, conservatism's days are numbered.  A real shame.  
I really doubt this haunts any Democrat.  This is pure politics and the Dems win no matter how this goes.  All Obama has to do is nominate a black or hispanic woman, wait for the GOP to block, and enjoy the circus that results.  And with the Court being split 4-4 along partisan lines, that means the lower circuit rulings will stand, whose judges are majority liberal.
Trump is destroying Conservatism itself and the Republicans are cheering him for it.  Didn't Lenin have a term for people like that?
That just sets it up for another challenge later.  Live to fight another day.
If you want to be disappointed again, go ahead.

Disappointed by Rubio? I just want a candidate who can beat the Dems. Trump is unstable and not even a real Republican. He'll get creamed when it's time to talk policy and the number of people who hate him far outweigh the number who support him.  Rubio could beat both Clinton or Sanders, so for me he's the safest bet.
oh yea, ole 3 percenter Jebster, that's the reason for sure
Your naïveté is serving as an obstacle to see that this is just standard procedure. You even talked about how the dems did it 20 years ago but you still didn't arrive to the conclusions that our politicians are just lying, self-serving pawns that use fabricated outrage to get their way. 
I wouldn't classify it as naiveté as much as curiosity of the other side of the spectrum. 

I'm well aware of the level of political corruptions on both sides of the isle. But I also like seeing how reasonable republicans &amp; conservatives respond to current events. I have my view points, they're not set in stone, but they're steadfast. Sometimes hearing how other people view things helps me fine tune my own beliefs. 



A colleague of mine who voted for the president, thinks the ACA doesn't go far enough, and thinks the stimulus should have been about 10x larger said the other day he doesn't want the current president nominating and appointing a justice on the grounds this administration has business before the court and any decision where the ninth vote is decisive could be seen as the president putting his thumb on the scale, so to speak.
You don't get it. You come here for the "reasonable republican" response? These are your counterparts that think that the fabricated outrage is sincere and just tow the party line from there on out. 

There isn't an actual defense for impeding Obama from doing his job other than sore losers trying to change the rules because they didn't win the election in '12 so that they could have the power. If tables we turned, would you expect the republicans to be saying President Romney shouldn't have the authority? It's laughable to even write out such a hypothetical. 
There's obviously hypocrisy in what Biden said but ultimately there is a reason why the constitution was written with this type of check and balance. 

In the ideal form of the Supreme Court the justices would be impartial interpreters of the written laws. When people say Scalia was a constitutionalist it was because he firmly believed, albeit from a conservative viewpoint, that the constitution was to be interpreted for what the words were intended to mean.

Having said that, the role the president has is to nominate someone and the job of the legislative branch is to confirm that the nominee is going to indifferently represent the intent of the law as it was written or reasonably intended to be. After Sotomayor's confirmation, who in many people's eye's is an extremely liberally biased judge with a track record to prove it, the new congress which was not the one who approved her nomination is being very wary about appointing someone impartial. To put that simply because of the way the last election went the Republican's are expecting the nominee to be someone they wouldn't approve anyway. Is it wrong for them to use their legal authority? No. Should they be making judgements and blanket statements before they get a nominee? For their own sake yes because it weakens the position of any "moderate" nominee. Personally I think that if President Obama picked a nominee that was undoubtedly conservative it would put them in a position where they would be skeptical but ultimately would approve them.
Doesn't that logic forbid *any* president from nominating a justice? A big part of the Supreme Court's job is to examine the actions of the President (and Congress). 
&gt; I just want a candidate who can beat the Dems.

You got 4 years of waiting then. 

&gt;Trump is unstable and not even a real Republican.

And neither am I. I'm a RINO and proud because the current GOP is a field of f-ing hypocritical, religious zealots, who don't understand the concept of compromising, or having an actual plan to accomplish anything. The party has turned it self into a joke, and now we have a joker taking over. Congrats. And for the record, I don't like Trump, but his playing of the game is masterful. 

&gt;He'll get creamed when it's time to talk policy and the number of people who hate him far outweigh the number who support him.

I'm still waiting on ONE person he's done business with to start campaigning for him. 

&gt; Rubio could beat both Clinton or Sanders, so for me he's the safest bet.

Lets stop repeating the fiction that Rubio knows what he is doing. He doesn't know what he is doing. (or however the self created meme goes)
It would not be uncommon for anyone appointed to recuse themselves from that case.  For example, Elena Kagan recused herself from various cases due to having worked with organizations that filed amicus briefs.

I think the messaging is all wrong. This should have nothing to do with it being the last year of Obama's presidency. The Senate should only consent to nominations that it approves of. If the president wants to nominate unreasonable judges (read judicial activists), we should just continue to block them, whether it takes 1, 2 or 10 years. When the two sides are original interpretation vs activist judges, you can't compromise on a partially activist judge. The senate has the authority to not consent, Democrats are just mad they don't have the senate.

One of the most liberal states doesn't have a growing republican party...ya don't say. I hear water is still wet too.
&gt; The United Kingdom is a nation state, home to Englishmen, Scotsmen, Welshmen and Ulstermen. These ethnicities have thus the privileges afforded by the British state as their undeniable birthright. Any attempts to deny these birthrights are criminal.
The ethnicities that form the United Kingdom are european, and thus is the United Kingdom an ethnically european country.
The British immigration policy will be one to prioritise needed professionals and valuable individuals, recognizing the nature of race and ethnicity to better assimilate those that come to Britain. Priority will also be given to the following countries: Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Then come countries from the broader Western World, such as Continental European countries, the United States, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil.
The United Kingdom will be kept at least 90% White British (English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish), and similar quotas are to be established in the nations of the union, e.g Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The remaining 10% is to be distributed as follows 8% to other white ethnicities and 2% to valuable individuals of any ethnicity. The last percentage may vary according to British needs that will be stipulated by the Home Office.

was just gonna say the same thing.
&gt; When people say Scalia was a constitutionalist it was because he firmly believed, albeit from a conservative viewpoint, that the constitution was to be interpreted for what the words were intended to mean.

Nevermind the complete bullshit in the "I'm a constitutionalist" standpoint.. but.. did you even read what you said? Or think about what it means?

Let's examine:
&gt; constitution was to be interpreted for what the words were intended to mean.

Those are 2 different things that you just threw together which sums in an ultimately meaningless statement. You can either go by the words, or the intent, but those are literally opposite things. The intent part is saying that you must first understand the INTENT of the writers before understanding what message they were trying to convey, while the words part means that you take the words for FACE value. What you just said is a contradiction, since you tried to jumble those two together. 

So now that we've cleared that. Let's talk about "intent" with a simple example. So when the Constitution was originally written, the INTENDED meaning of the writing didn't include black people whenever it spoke of people's rights, because black people were of course viewed as subhuman. So if we go by the "intent" of the Constitution, as in, the views we can assume based on slave ownership and denial of black rights by the writers, then that means we would be supporting the continued denial of rights to black people. Afterall, that's what we will argue the original authors intended. But if we go by the WORDS, on face value, then we see that ALL people are guaranteed these rights. 

So in other words, whenever people claim they're a "constitutionalist," it's really just a falsely-packaged way of saying that they support the most bigoted interpretation of the Constitution that they can get away with. You can't just take the intrepretation from 50 years ago and claim that THAT was the "original intent." You gotta go big (full blown racism, slavery, denial of women's rights) or go home if you're gonna use the word "Consitutionlist."
I don't think Rubio necessarily has a clue either, but I think he could bring in moderates and even some right leaning Democrats to vote for him. Also, I think he'd be a help getting the Hispanic vote. He's no mental giant, but if it's him or Clinton, I'm going with him. If it's down to Trump and Clinton, I don't even know what I'll do. We need a Republican in the White House, but Trump? I don't even know what he is.
I would have thought "This is serious" would have been Rubio's most used three word phrase.
Constitutionalism is not considering the written laws as they should apply to modern society but by the meaning of the law as it was written. You basically re-described what I was saying and then because you disagree with it went into why you disagree with constitutionalism. 
The thing is that the amendments to the constitution are such that the constitution was literally changed through the legislative process to give rights to people of all races and to women as well. You're extension of constitutionalism to the judicial precedent set by the original constitution is completely false and ignorant of the actual reasoning that builds the foundation for constitutionalism.
Drunkenly, would be my suggestion.
No, you tried to describe it as both "original intent" and "meaning of the words." I pointed out why that is a contradiction. I also pointed out an logic-stressing example as to why, even if given a non-contradicting definition, the term "Consitituionlist" as it is used by Republicans is complete garbage.

We have your sentence for both of us to read and it is clear as day, you contradicted yourself in defining a consitutionalist. But I wouldn't expect anything less from such a shallow and dishonest term. It's the same exact way that Christians will selectively interpret the Bible and make an argument about "original intent," "practicality," or "societal adjustment" when the Bible disagrees with their viewpoint, but then talk about "strict word usage" and "God wouldn't have said it if he didn't mean it" when the Bible agrees with their viewpoint.
Even if granted, perhaps the senate should give the president a list of potential nominees, have the president pick one, and then perform a more thorough investigation.
How would that work in the Zubik case, where the vote is expected to be 4-4 and the appeals court's are split? Waiting allows the addition of a 9th justice to prevent such a tie.
You have [Constitutonalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionalism) mischaracterized in your head as [Originalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism). You clearly don't understand the difference. The constitution changes when the legislative process changes it and then constitutionalists interpret the new form of the Constitution  for its original intent not what is politically fashionable. An originalist would try to revert the constitution back to the first for of the Constitution. You're arguing an entirely different thing than what I'm talking about because you don't understand what the term constitutionalist means.
If this is the best they can dig up on the guy...

No, you defined it yourself and the definition was outright wrong and contradictory to itself, which is what I am pointing out. Yes, I'm glad you've gone and done your research so next time when you try to define Constituionalist you won't jumble up the definition.

Let me be clear once more just to make sure there is no ambiguity here: YOU are the one who incorrectly defined Constituionalist in your original post by defining it as an oxymoron of intent and face value.

I wish.
On your first point, Rubio's tenure in the Senate is only two years less than John F. Kennedy’s when he was elected president. He has far more experience in elected office than did Abraham Lincoln or Teddy Roosevelt. As a state legislator, Rubio quickly rose in the leadership and served as speaker of the Florida House. Barack Obama, by contrast, remained a back-bencher in the Illinois legislature. You also might not realize much of a senator's goes on outside the senate, like talking with constituents.

On your second point, do you have proof of the "bought and paid for" and "liars and cowards" and "no longer serve the people" claims or are you just being cynical?
Its too late now.  He knows that.  Its unfortunate, I wish he did run, but I can't see it happening

Also his extreme change of course from a 'Policy oriented candidate' to a 'Donald Trump wet his pants' slanderer is proof that he is a puppet, an amateur, and not somebody I want to represent me at this most important time in history.  

His position on H1B visas is enough for me to vote him out of office.

One thing I'll give trump credit for: he definitely has the GOP establishment running around with their hair on fire. The irony of it all is that he had done it by basically acting like a parody of the GOP status quo. 
Do you know what it means to be "dead"?
I voted for Romney last election. But if this happened it would not sit well with me. I think it would enrage the public even more at the establishment and backfire. I mean, I guess the guys making these decisions have a lot more relevant statistical info than I do to make the decision. However, we are seeing an enraged population and record numbers in primaries. If this transitions to record voters for the national election it might not even matter.
Twitter has more media relevance than relevance for the normal person. I know to the people that tweet this seems sacrilegious, but the majority of people do not tweet and don't care about it.
What MSM was saying in my opinion was a bad stance to take. I mean if they all are thinking it, it's one thing but to outright say that is in my interpretation of the Constitution wrong. Any constitutional law book clearly states that justices are given life terms to try to remove them from the political process. At some point, (30-40 years ago?) this got lost on both parties. That being said the purpose of the Supreme Court has also shifted and is now "creating" law moreso than interpreting the law. So this has become a heated discussion.

Now on to answer your question, I think despite what MSM said, if Obama nominates someone that everyone in the Senate agrees would be a good justice (barring politics) then they will be confirmed. This has happened in the past. So I think it really depends more on the moral character and interpretation of constitutional law. Saddly, interpretation of Constitutional Law has become a very partisan thing over the past half century.
Not necessarily. Not every president pushes Laws that have to go to the Supreme Court multiple times and are split decisions of 5-4. I think it would be arguable that it would be a conflict of interest. That is also why while the president makes nominations the Senate must confirm the candidate. Given that the constitution has no prerequisites for a justice other than presidential nomination a Senator could choose to not vote for a nominee on this basis, or any basis.
Could you provide a link? I've been reading otherwise. And things could get a lot worse of the year with the ongoing FBI investigation into Hilary.
Grasping for straws at this point. 
Every president in recent memory has had major actions that come up against the Supreme Court.

[Bush] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boumediene_v._Bush) 

[Clinton] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York) 

[Reagan] (https://ccrjustice.org/home/what-we-do/our-cases/crockett-v-reagan) 

I'm not going through the whole history (and I skipped Bush 41 out of the annoyance of googling him in a way that didn't lead to his son), but off the top of my head I can think of the challenges to FDR's New Deal policies, to which FDR responded with attempted court-packing, unsuccessfully nominating several more justices to the court in the hopes of changing its ideology through expansion, and Lincoln's pretty constant fight with the court over war powers. 

If the court weren't dealing with the acting president, it wouldn't be doing its job. It was designed to serve as a check on the executive. This pretty much always includes the current executive. So to say the president can't appoint judges while he has business before the court is to take away the constitutionally granted power from every president but William Henry Harrison. 
No one said he can't appoint judges, or even nominate the new justice. Just that like you said, there are checks and balances and the Senate doesn't have to confirm candidates they don't approve for any reason. I was just pointing out that for a Senator they could use that as a reason, as they could have historically too.
It would have to pass Congress. The president can only request a bill like that to be passed. Sort of like the Obama care Tax
Because we already have Trump.

You'll probably want to hop over to /r/Conservative for more on this.

I can give you a little information here, though. Basically, states send a certain amount of delegates total to the national convention after all of the primaries/caucuses are over. Many of the first few states do this proportionally, so if Donald Trump wins 40% of the votes, he only gets 40% of the delegates from that state. Some, especially later on, are winner take all, so if Trump gets 40% and no one else gets more, he wins every delegate from the state.

So what are the options? First of all, it's pretty early on. Least likely, but still very possible is that Trump could lose support after yesterday and Cruz/Rubio could pull ahead. Sure, Trump's got a lot of delegates, over 300, but he needs over 1200 to win and we aren't there yet.

More likely, but not the most likely, other's will drop out and give enough support to Cruz or Rubio and boost them ahead. When you drop out I believe you can direct your delegates to another candidate. For instance, Kasich could take Ohio then drop out and direct nearly 100 delegates to someone else.

The most likely seems to be that perhaps Carson and Kasich will drop out and Cruz and Rubio won't. Trump so far has not been getting the majority in his wins. 40% might seem like a lot, but it's still not a majority. If that continues, he won't have enough to win, and the remaining candidates can do a brokered convention in which the delegates are redistributed. 

If all of that fails, there's the general election in which Trump will be against Hillary Clinton (the DNC is a lot different and I know Sanders supporters are holding onto some technicalities but it's more likely that Cruz/Rubio will win the GOP nomination than Sanders will, I'll put it that way). There are plenty of polls showing Trump losing to Hillary, but likely it will probably be close. It seems like a lot of voters on both sides will either vote third party or not vote at all because they don't like their choices. If it comes to this, I will vote for Trump simply because I don't think many of his policies will go through and at the very least we get conservative supreme court nominations, cabinet appointments, and conservative bills passed. 
**WTF**

&gt; This is why you simply must, for the good of the United States and for your own beliefs, withdraw from the race and place all your support behind Rubio

super loser Rubio ?

Rubio is somewhere between 16-20 points behind Trump in **FLORIDA** and will surely lose, **again**

let's wipe that turd Rubio off our butts and move on to the Trump avalanche

He's right but I don't believe he really cares. 
"Debate"
the problem most commonly brought up is that with his views a sanders presidency would spell gridlock for the four years. I'd counter that it is gridlock anyway. Bernie has reached across the isle in the past though, so who knows. The way I am looking at things at this point is at least Trump isn't Cruz, at least Clinton isn't Trump, and at least Sanders isn't Clinton. It's a cascade of shit all the way down. 
You have to go back.
National Review? The magazine that started off an entire special edition anti-Trump edition with Glenn Beck!?!?
Well, forgetting the fact that he chose the Soviet fucking Union as his honey moon destination, and forgetting the fact he wrote an essay about women fantasizing about getting gang raped, he claims he's anti establishment, yet he wishes to increase the budget of the federal government when the government has a long disgusting track record of abusing our money and being outright fraudulent and wasteful with our money. Do you believe sanders will magically make the government efficient? To incentivize government to do their fuckin job you put the fire under their ass with massive cuts you don't award them with more money. That's eco 101
Would be in his best interest. Better to bow out and focus on his Senate seat than lose in Florida, then lose the Senate seat to Ben Carson.
Dead=no energy
Where are you weirdos coming from all of a sudden?
Dang shills, sheesh.
My parents lived in the Soviet Union. Although Bernie seems to love the idea of the USA becoming like that, I can tell you it's a very uninspired form of Government. 

Plus, what Bernie is proposing is extreme increase in Government control. Do you really want to give these nut jobs even MORE power?
Yeah yeah, we get it. We're all racist. Sigh, time to rise up against these shills.
Would also be unfair to Cruz too. Both would get replaced by Romney/Ryan ticket. 
Genius at ruining his campaign
/r/The_Donald 
I disagree.  If the GOP doesn't go with Trump the GOP won't have a future. Trump is bringing new voters into the party.  If they don't back Trump they will never get those people back. 
Which part of this article do you agree with most that makes you side with #nevertrump? 
They really are. Its clear he was having issues with it. Very Sad. 
When we have people cutting off heads and killing people, bringing back torture is the least of our worries
Well, if you don't wanna read this tripe, I took the bullet. Basically the guy is a pro-lifer who was butthurt because Mr. Trump commended Planned Parenthood for the good work they do (while glossing over Mr. Trumps assertion that he would not allow Federal money to be spent on abortion). The dude is really into a President that wants to fight a "cultural" and "spiritual" battle. Sorry douche, it's a President NOT a Pastor. This guy is OBVIOUSLY a Cruhz plant if I ever seen one. EXPOSED!
If you're a liberal and genuinely want terrible liberal policies, Hillary is actually able to win unlike Bernie. I barely see a difference between them honestly, I've watched every single Dem debate. Voting for Bern is throwing a vote away into thin air. At least with Hillary you get closer to the liberal crap you apparently want. 
15 trillion dollars in tax raises.
The problem is nobody likes Cruz except for Texas. 
-The man is a racist. He said that white people cant be poor.
-Very low energy and won't defend himself. Had his own rally taken over by protestors. 
-Fails to bring up the scandals and crimes the Clintons committed.
-Believes that a Republican controlled Congress and Senate will pass any of his policies. He will be an Obama clone

The guy supported Romney in 2012. Romney said in 1994 (in a debate vs Ted Kennedy) that he was pro choice and pro-Roe v. Wade. Romney appointed 75 percent liberal judges in Mass. as governor. Romney signed RomneyCare -- he is the "godfather" of ObamaCare. Again, French supported Romney, but won't support Trump now, even though Trump says he's evolved on abortion. Puzzling.
Genius? One week later...Little Marco can't break double digits and is gonna lose his home state next week. Sad little man indeed.
Doesn't mean much. Cruz is pretty far behind in Florida, Ohio, Illinois.  Not sure it moves many votes either way. As Rubio fades, people may begin shifting their votes away from Rubio toward Kasich or Cruz as Rubio continues his death spiral. Trump I'd say is looking pretty well positioned in FL as Rubio's campaign is on the verge of collapse.
He was also endorsed by the most respected black person in Mississippi who marched beside MLK. 

Edit: Charles Evers is his name. 
So much picking and choosing. He praised PP, right? What about the *actual* stance he holds... The one that doesn't allow federal funding for abortions? And why shouldn't planned parenthood be commended for the good that they do? Cancer screenings, mammograms, early detection and general health services - would you condemn these? Are these not valuable services that they provide?
This is the site that tells me the top 10 reasons my highschool friend will be my friend forever? As if I didn't already know? 
I think that, even if he doesn't drop out, we can expect his vote percentages to drop so low that he gets next to no delegates from here on out.
Are you asking sincerely, or are you just wasting my time as part of this ridiculous brigade?
Marco won't have a future in politics. I'm missing the genius aspect of his campaign. 
Agreed, I'd heard some discussion of her bringing in the female vote but, frankly she was unable to do that for her own campaign,.  that said behind a more mild mannered conservative like Cruz I wondered if she couldn't a higher share of those ex-Rubio voters.
Do you actually think that if the media had something damning on him they wouldn't find a way to "leak it"? Journalistic integrity and the sanctimony of "off the record" notwithstanding, there's both no bombshell news and what little trustworthiness the media still holds would be shattered by purposefully distributing off the record remarks. 
Obviously you never researched Donald Trumps beliefs that well. **HE IS PRO LIFE**, and does not believe that abortion is a good thing, because it is horrible. Mr Trump only believes that planned parenthood is great  since it is the leading provider of high-quality, affordable health care for women, men, and young people, and the nation's largest provider of sex education. 
If these establishment Republicans fail to get behind the clear victor (after next week) and go and tell everyone to vote for Hillary and #NeverTrump, What is going to happen if Hillary wins and they have no credibility in their attacks against her policies? Why should we support a fight with them? We voted for who they wanted us to vote for. Well, fuck that! #NeverHillary #Trump2016
https://youtu.be/0t3aG0jFU-k
All I can say is that you should not use Reddit to do research on parties since it is heavily biased towards certain candidates. I would recommend doing research on every candidate on your own and check out their websites.
Find someone whose family or who themselves have survived and escaped a socialist hellhole like the Soviet Union, China or Cuba. How many stories of deprivation, fear, neighbors reporting you for thought crimes and starvation will it take for you to get your mind right?
He's the most logical choice for the "anyone but Trump" crowd. Unlike Rubio and Kasich, Cruz has a strong and loyal following. 
Do you think Fio will be good for him then, bringing more people into that loyal fold, or will it be overall insignificant?  I never knew much about her to be honest...!
The way I see it Trump is likely poised to get between 35-40% in Ohio and Florida--probably toward the higher end in Florida--so the question is is another candidate capable of matching or beating Trump's percentage in those states. Rubio has only broken 30 in Virginia (lost), Minnesota (won), and Puerto Rico (won). I have a hard time seeing Rubio in such a large and diverse state like Florida breaking into the mid-to-high 30s, despite it being his home state. Based on how Trump has fared in the Deep South, you'd expect Trump to crush it on the Panhandle, but even outside of the Panhandle Trump is likely to run pretty strong. Barring something major or unforeseen I think Trump will cruise to a victory in Florida. 
We were invited
This subreddit would definitely benefit from more submissions by Social Matter.
It doesn't mean much.  She doesn't bring much to the table that Cruz didn't already have.  She doesn't bring the kind of energy or a major voting block that he would need to compete with Trump for the nomination.

As someone else said Rubio will be gone after Florida.  Kasich was a spoiler for Ohio and ceases to exist when the polls close there.   Cruz is going to get most of their voters by default.   The big question is if he can close on Trump after that point.   If Kasich takes Ohio it is a possibility.   If trump sweeps the big three (Florida, Ohio, Illinois) next week then it really doesn't matter what Cruz does.
Trump is going to call Shillary corrupt to her face, instead of tap dancing around it like Bernie. I look forward to the day
Yeah, that's great. You guys clearly bring a level of wide-eyed fanaticism that we were lacking previously.
It depends on which issues you find most critical. In my case, I view immigration reform as a major issue, and I prefer Donald Trump's immigration policies over Sanders', specifically his plan to deal with illegals. Sanders is in favor of amnesty and weakening our border, as well as limitations on deportation. These things are all counterproductive because: 1. amnesty will put those who illegally cross our border (including the vast number of criminals in that group) at a higher priority than those who cross legally and with good intentions, 2. Weakening the border will only exacerbate the already dangerous situation for our border patrols and the citizens to the south, and 3. If we fail to deport those whom we deem undeserving of American citizenship (namely criminals), they will remain an active threat to American citizens. This is all the evidence I need not to want to vote for Sanders, since he is looking at something that doesn't require much evaluation to conclude that we need to secure the border more than ever before, and has instead publicly announced that he is in favor of doing the exact opposite. 
I think this puts Fiorina at the front of the line for VP on a Cruz ticket. Cruz is trying to portray himself as someone who can beat Hillary by playing the identity politics game with Fiorina. Plus, Fiorina was an anti-Trump attack dog her whole campaign (even lied and said he didn't go to Wharton!!!), so Cruz probably wants to elevate her in the national eye again and get another voice in there attacking Trump. IMHO, it won't move the needle much, but it may calm establishment types who want a more neocon-type VP who can attract women voters, making it easier for them to back Cruz at a contested convention. 
I think it's too late. Rubio and Kasich will hang in there til their home states go. Trump's going to accumulate a lot of delegates in the process. If it becomes Trump vs Cruz the later part of the calendar favors Trump. The later states are more northern, more moderate to liberal. A brokered convention is their best chance to deny Trump the nomination, and not giving the nomination to the person who got the most votes in the primaries would ruin the Republican party. Coalescing behind Cruz, who the establishment also hates, is a Hail Mary attempt to stop Trump while not destroying the party. 

The establishment is fucked. 
Trump needs to stump her on her TERRIBLE management of HP, like the worst CEO EVER. Her endorsement of Cruz is a vote for winning.

Any republican who endorses a losing... candidate, who is NOT the people's choice, who is not making history by bringing huge populations of people into the Republican party, wants Republicans to lose the General election. We have to unite around the front runner and start healing from this brutal primary if we want to keep the numbers we've gained.  Trumps voters will not vote in the General at all if he's not the candidate.

Speaking of terrorists, Trump has repeatedly, definitively stated that he wants to "go after their families." Killing women and children because they happen to be related to jihadis is downright insane. It's monstrous. It's completely beyond the pale.

 /r/AskTrumpSupporters 

As a former liberal myself Trump is actually the most reasonable (of the republicans) when it comes to health issues etc. so he is probably the person you should fear the *least*. The left media doesn't like him because they know he can beat Hillary. 


Anyway, back to your question. Basically, in the US we vote for the person not the party (that goes for all local, state, &amp; federal elections). It is a little complicated but basically only one political party ever has one real leader at a time, the President. (That's why democrats don't run against incumbent democrat president by the way.) The best way to think of US political parties is as a flag to wave that shows which direction (left/right) you tend to side on overall. 

That being said, each party does have a *very* loose and *unofficial* group of "party elders" (elected officials) who do exert some degree of influence but not all that much (case in point: Donald Trump).


Personally, I think it is more democratic this way. 

And when you hear about a "brokered convention" that is when no one in the party has an outright majority of votes and so that unofficial group of party elders will usually try to help broker a deal. 

Does that answer your question?
she still mad about the "look at her face" comment
Best arguments to vote for Trump I've read in a long time, thanks OP.
It means the four people who supported her campaign may now consider El Rato (aka Lyin' Ted).
Hi, MAGA!!
Riiight.
We need another truly presidential person in the white house, it has been far to long. Let's MAGA.
Okay, first off, Trump has backed Planned Parenthood's operations with the exception of late-term abortions that don't endanger the mother and has said he will remove federal funding. That's the best of both worlds. Secondly, Trump has only singled out vets saying that he will fight for better treatment, and never said vets were mindless like this man suggested. He blamed George Bush for lying to get the war enough support. Thirdly, are you fucking serious? You're afraid to kill the families of the people who have sworn their existence to killing our families? These children will be growing up in an environment that is inherently in support of hostile ideologies that are in no way conducive to a democratic way of life. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't single out women and children even if they're relatives of the enemy, but we can't make decisions based on emotion anymore. If a city with innocent people is raided and taken over by ISIS militants, and we trace them to a base that harbors thousands of Islamic State soldiers as well as their families, and we can't spend the resources for a ground assault that would cost American lives, we have to do the logical thing and stop the threat from the air. In that situation there would be no other choice. Fourth, his sexual experiences are not going to dictate or affect his ability to lead. If you're suggesting he's a godless man, you're dead wrong. He's a Presbyterian, his faith has been backed by his minister, and has said his favorite book is the Bible. 
&gt;Evolved

I wonder what the orange ape with the ever-changing opinions will "evolve" into next.
Literally the number 1 thing I can not wait for in this election. Trump is going to Savage her. 
If I was an American I would join the Republicans in a heartbeat.
If anything it helps Trump. Carly is unlikable. Look at the endorsement video, she looks cold, and miserable. 
The killing is contingent on their own downright insane, monstrous, beyond the pale ideologies and actions. That includes women and if they are old enough, the children who also subscribe. 

I disagree with Trump on some things. You will never find a candidate who aligns perfectly with what you believe. But, Mr. Trump will be best for America, by far. Even if you hate Trump, not voting for him in November is a Hillary vote. 
#HIGHLY VENOMOUS 
For years the GOP and Democrat establishments have been using small impact, but high emotion wedge issues to keep the country divided along lines that are easy for them to manage.   Take same sex marriage as an example. In a country of 332 million people about 1.2 million adults are living in a same-sex domestic partnerships.  Of those the surveys show that only one in three is contemplating actually getting married.   So the entire same sex marriage issue that has kept the country reliably divided for our political masters on the left and right actually impacts one tenth of one percent of the population.  Meanwhile issues like inflation, stagnant wages, crime, debt, deterioration of the infrastructure and monopoly control of the banking system that impact just about everyone are ignored.   Or if not ignored you are called a racists, bigot, homophobe for daring to look at the issues without constraining any alternatives to the politically correct options the establishment has deemed willing to offer.

Trump isn't just redrawing lines, he is redrawing the rules.  We are going to have an argument about the big issues this time.  You may not like what you hear, you may have your precious feelings hurt, but damn it the important issues that effect the vast majority of US citizens are going to be argued about this time.   Win or lose the important issues will be addressed.

I respect both of their opinions but the fact remains that Ted Cruz isn't electable with his ties to evangelicals, he doesn't have the spine on immigration that Donald has, and he doesn't have a record of being able to work with others to get things done - no LEADERSHIP. 
This is exactly the case. well written article. 

and to top it off ABC/Disney is also getting in bet with the Mitt's of the world. First they fire Ditka, then they start parading Mitt out on Kimmel. Disgusting.
I think Steel-Mech's point was that it doesn't confront your statement, but that your statement (and your reply to him) was laced with stupid insults. Trump has been inconsistent on the issue of abortion, agreed. So was Romney. Yet Trump has openly pledged to defund Planned Parenthood even though he believes they do some good things. Evolved, changed, repented, whatever -- my point is that there's no reason to believe that Trump's position is insincere if you believe Romney's was sincere. I'm not saying you believed Romney, but I know for a fact that the author you linked to did and supported him. And I have great respect for French -- he gave up a cushy lawyer job to fight for our country in Iraq just because he believed in the war and wanted to put his money where his mouth was. I don't agree with him on the war, but I can appreciate a guy who stands up for his convictions like that.

There isn't any particularly good reason to believe either of them, especially Trump. He's been a salesman of his own name his whole adult life, and that's exactly what he's doing now. I have no reason to put my faith in him, and Romney has nothing to do with that equation.

Shut up Rubio.  Sick of that line.
Why does Republican always have to be synonymous with anti abortion?

I've voted for the 'R' for the last 21 years and I've never really cared about abortion. Sure, I'm male, but honestly there's more important things going on with this country that we should focus on. It's about picking your battles.
Watches Current Year meme, posts in /r/republican. 

Bernie supporter detected.
Again, it has to do with the author. You linked to his article as some kind of persuasive piece about Trump. Yet the author (French) opposes Trump while he supported Romney. Many Never Trumpers supported Romney too. You may be different, and that's fine. You may never believe that Trump is actually pro-life or that he is serious about his immigration policies. I think promises to defund PP and the endorsement of Sen. Sessions say otherwise.
how do you figure Trump would be like Reagan and Lincoln and not Rubio or Cruz?
not really, it's very important to still be a nation of laws. it's at their most important when facing brutal savages to not dip toward their level. we should not act like ISIS

He's been a salesman of much more than his name, though his name marks many of the actual things he sells.  Ties, clothes, real estate, golf, hotels, Trump sells a whole gambit of things.  When it comes to selling one's name is it possible to find someone more guilty than a professional politician?  It's literally the only thing they sell.  That and their usually amorphous platforms.  Of course Trump is selling his name right now, he's running for office.  That is literally how you get somewhere in a political race.  Think the other candidates aren't selling things?  Their political donor lists say otherwise.  Those who cannot adapt die.  That's generally accepted as a law of nature.  Trump has proven he can adapt and succeed.  You can attack him for it, but you'd be placing yourself into the temporarily comfortable position of inability to adapt.  Trump is going to win the nomination.  Can you really stomach voting for a Democrat who is OPENLY PRO CHOICE?  The rigidity of #NeverTrump is it's own downfall.  Enjoy the months leading up to the general, because it's going to be a long 4.5 years of disappointment for you.

It means precisely nothing. Zero personal brand. No one knows who she is.

And when they do find her they don't want to stay because she's annoying.
What you're talking about is a realignment, and if things are allowed to proceed as they should, 2016 is screaming the words "realigning election."

"No more globalism" is exactly right. This is what's behind the rebellion in BOTH parties right now.

Don't usually like to promote myself, but I think my two posts on the matter are what should be known by everyone regarding realignment:

The Trump rebellion: http://masculineepic.com/index.php/2016/01/23/the-2016-popular-revolt-the-trump-train/
The Bernie rebellion: http://masculineepic.com/index.php/2016/01/28/the-2016-popular-revolt-feel-the-bern/
A society without strong moral foundations and strict expectations of behavior will always fall prey to liberalism. That kind of thinking is exactly how you get 12 million invaders squatting in your country or your president importing terrorists. You're right, you can't control and shouldn't send people to jail over what they do in their bedroom. But there is a huge difference between that and the government/society openly endorsing and celebrating it.

The thing is, the average person sleeps well at night knowing nothing about this. And while I hate to be a person of secrets, or for a nation of secrets, some should be kept. If we have to resort to torture to get ISIS captives to talk, so be it. Just don't tell the general public about it, as they cannot be trusted to understand.
Agreed, these guys are sad and nasty. 
Because he will make America great again!
Which isn't Sanders. He is pandering for the poor, not the middle class. The shtick about making everyone middle class is a ruse. There is no way to bring up everyone to middle class, just as there is no way to make everyone wealthy. Or at least not in a sustainable manner.
Reagan was a terrible president in hindsight
The big question is who will win Ohio
I'm ready to post with the **+420 Stumped** memes when that happens.
Nasty people, but they won't stump can't stump 
again, if you deny people rights based on what they are doing, you are beginning to dip toward their level. 

there is room for debate on what torture is though, and I agree you should do a lot of it. but speaking about it broadly and in positive tones is very dangerous and shouldn't be encouraged
But our army also torture them because pleasure and satisfaction 
All excellent points.

Voters are more educated and have better and faster access to a much wider breadth of information than in the history of mankind.  I feel like this election cycle more than any other is strongly effected by that.

Look at how quickly and easily we're now able to fact check what politicians say.  Note how quickly so many of us abandoned the mainstream news outlets because of how easy it's become to see through their agendas.

Sure, not everyone does the same level of research, and, yeah, the internet can be used equally effective as a circle jerking echo chamber, but for the first time in a long time I truly feel like the phrase "information revolution" truly fits.  And I work in IT!
Yeah that's why Trump said he will go to congress and change the laws to give us an advantage.

This. 
We have many problems that a President should be concerned with. Abortion is not one of them. That is a state issue.
Really? Somwe should not take away the right to keep arms from felons? Should convicted pedophiles have the right to adopt children? 

People's behavior is exactly what we should look to when taking away rights.

They treated Reagan like an outsider at first. I can't really compare him to Abe Lincoln much. I just think Trump would be a great president. 
Twisting the truth, and lying to fulfill a narrative that is otherwise unsupportable isn't "telling it like it is". That is lying, and shilling.

This is disgusting.  I can not believe how disrespectful this is.  

First he misses Scalia's funeral.  Now Mrs. Reagan?  I can not WAIT until the next election.
Bernie is undoubtedly a great, honest candidate. But he lacks the vigor and ruthlessness we need on the world stage or even domestically. Look at how Republicans blocked Obama, Bernie is a Republican wet dream, an actual socialist, they won't give him an inch. 

Only trump can arm wrestle the GOP into getting something done imo. 
Which is Donald Trump by far.

Not necessarily, he had good ideas that were met with heavy change and planning issues. 

He meant for the best. 
Damn OP you're just raking in the downvotes!

You can knock Sanders, Rubio, and Clinton out, then
We even hate him here in Florida
Let's just say what needs to be said about about abortion: It sucks. There isn't a single situation where anyone leaves an abortion and says "DAMN! I'm glad I did that." It's a terrible situation regardless of whatever reason someone has an abortion. It doesn't make it any better or worse to get one because of rape, economics, preventing the birth of a severely disabled child, or just preventing a "mistake".

That said, it's still necessary, it has solid legal precedent, and attacking it is pushing people, especially women or men who have had a partner get an abortion, far and fast from the party. Abortion is a decision that I think most people don't ever want to have to face and the current Republican answer to it is to say "it's wrong and should be outlawed and you're wrong for ever having had one."

The stance that's basically been pushed on candidates for abortion is one that's authoritarian in view. This party stands to gain the vast majority of independents, Reagan Dems, and blue-dog Dems by dropping this moral-authoritarian bit and focusing on economics, trade, immigration, and foreign policy: all areas that even most Democrats will admit their party is laughably flimsy on.

I guess to each their own. I feel like if they are going to start it, we should get to finish it. Teach them a lesson, make an example out of them. I will tell you another thing, it starts in the homeland for us, we need to make groups to keep track of immigrants, small militias maybe, make sure they aren't up to something, you know? 
I think this is a good article showing how the old right is just as wrapped up in identity politics as the new left. "I fought in the Iraq war, so it had to be for a good reason! Are you calling me a stooge?" We don't need these people in the New Republican party. Buh-bye!
Spotted the Trumpeter. 
I don't always listen to or agree with Limbaugh, but he hit the nail on the head today.  People aren't "unilateral" voters.  Maybe they were in the past, but the issues with the United States are wide reaching.  There are so many different issues to take into consideration when voting.  Right now, we need a strong economy, and we need to be safe.  I am a Christian, I follow my own values.  But we also understand that the federal government shouldn't have the authority to dictate what we can and can not do personally....  Leave that up to the states, and respect what the people in each state vote for.  Problem solved!  Watching the RNC and GOP squirm with "Evangelicals"  voting for trump is hilarious.  They think they are so short-sighted.  They have underestimated their knowledge and intelligence.  The US has awoken. 
Pretty sure he means beat, as in defeat. Not pummel, maim etc. A little water boarding? Sure. But not physical violence. 
Exercising her choice to murder her own child? Yeah, I can't imagine why anyone would be against that.
Yes it was.  Of course you have no clue because you never bothered to read about it.
Kind of amusing to be downvoted by a Trumpster brigade.
No they fucking don't. Not as an institutional policy anyway. 
"Current Year meme." Funnily enough, I still don't know what that is.
How so?
Im waiting for a link. But that wouldn't work with your confirmation bias now would it?
The Republicans of Lincoln aren't the same party. They expanded government control which is greatly against small government. 

Although, the Republicans were the new Whigs who saw the old Whigs as Trump sees establishment Republicans. 
I have a feeling Kasich pulls off Ohio but then again Trump has a pretty good chance. Don't think it'll be Cruz. I'd give Kasich the slight edge.
Kind of is? Shouldn't this be the sub where we bring in the establishment-type Republicans and show them we're serious about good governance and down ballot support, and not just memeing?
Bisexual American here. I would have no problem voting Republican if the evangelicals where removed. I do not want to talk about my habits in the bedroom and hear you scream about hellfire and brimstone in my face. I want to talk about real issues. How do we handle healthcare reform? What can we do to create new jobs? How are we going to chop down the deficit? How do we get rid of ~~bribery~~ lobbying from congress? How are we going to tackle climate change? How are we going to cut government spending? These are the issues people want to hear about, not about going to war with Iran or gay marriage. 
This is a non-issue. Presidents do not typically attend the funerals of first ladies. 

Bill Clinton did not attend Pat Nixon’s. President Bush didn't attend Lady Bird Johnson’s. Obama didn't attend Betty Ford’s. Jimmy Carter didn’t attend Mamie Eisenhower’s. FDR didn't attend Lou Henry Hoover’s. Reagan didn't attend Bess Truman's. 

The only ones in recent history who have done so are JFK going to Eleanor Roosevelt's, and Bill Clinton going to Jackie O.'s--- and Clinton was a family friend, so that isn't that isn't weird.

(Quote from /u/brettpilkington07 )


I'm going to be brutally honest with you.  Your vote in a primary will be important and I encourage you to vote your mind, however at the end of the day you have to face the likelihood that Bernie Sanders, through all the passion he's inspired is not looking good to become the Democratic nominee.

So, then the question becomes, what are the reasons you should not vote for Hillary Clinton?  Which is a very different question, but has enough answers that I think you probably already know them.
That is literally the opposite of how economics work. If economics was a zero-sum game, then efforts to redistribute wealth to the poor would make sense. The point is that empowering those who will add back to the system (middle class) makes everyone everywhere richer.
I can't even begin to imagine the chaos that would ensue after such a coup.
I'm soooooo sorry.  I tried to stop it.  I really did.
Anyone with Internet access of any sort is in the top 40%, how dare they suppress the majority of the planet.
Hmm, see thinking about amnesty as a "what is fair" can also go the other way. Why should we let a family of poor immigrants come here through a legal process over someone who has been living here crime-free for 15 years? I wouldn't agree with limiting deportation of criminals but why open the door to the literal "worst they can send" when we could just keep the best ones we already have.
um wut
Increased spending doesn't mean more government power. Every single candidate right now (who has given policy) supports a larger government. That's not even an issue in this election.

Abortion is not necessary!!! I am a woman, and I was so happy to find the reddit group for Trump a few days ago, and I've truly enjoyed the clean comments that are there, and on this one. However, abortion actually kills an innocent human being. I don't get angry often, but when I heard my first baby's heartbeat, and saw his precious little body in the first ultrasound, I was angry, very angry, about the silence on this issue. I'm SO glad that I followed my gut and ditched not one, but THREE boyfriends who tried to get me to have sex by saying they'd pay for an abortion. Praise God for my husband, who was pro-life even before I was. Praise God for all the men out there who have the courage to trust and protect those of us women who cherish precious children, no matter how "inconvenient". "Women's issue" is a cop out. It's everyone's issue. We are all human. Women who want to kill babies are either very ignorant or psycho.
you are obviously trying to troll now. I'm with you though, and am against Trump

Many other sitting presidents have not attended the funeral of a former First Lady. I don't really see the point of attending the funeral of someone who didn't have much of a role in their life. 
Why do you think Romney's super pac is campaigning to Rubio in Florida and Kasich in Ohio?! They want this brokered convention so they can stab the American people in the back!
Shit man I have family that grew up in Sweden and Denmark and let me tell you it is fucking hell... Imagine waking up and your baby is sick and you can just get him medical attention without going $60k into debt.

Eisenhower and Roosevelt are nothing at all like the current Republican party. 

You're just a brigading Sanders supporter aren't you: http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/11/16/bernie-sanders-and-the-horrors-of-eisenhowers-91-top-income-tax-rate/#42736aef2725
That's a common argument but it doesn't stand up to any degree of scrutiny.  Lets delve a tiny bit deeper to understand why.

**Free College Tuition**

The poor already receive federal grants for tuition.  Thus, the Sanders policy gives the same benefit to the middle.

**Medicare for All**

The poor already get free healthcare in the form of Medi-Cal.  Under a single-payer system the middle class gets this benefit.  

At some point you have to separate the rhetoric from the reality.

**BUILD**
We can make the republican party great again, that is the name of the sub.
It absolutely is. As much of a Sanders supporter I am, I'm more than willing to listen to other opinions, especially because the MSM decides what does and does not get focused on during primetime. I'd rather a more comprehensive and intelligent place to learn about what Republicans want to do to change our country for the better.

Memes and circlejerking will absolutely not get me to change my vote to Republican. Intelligent discussion and facts just may.
Presidents have pretty good leverage if the plan is even somewhat reasonable as they can veto anything congress does and he can just keep proposing minor changes to congress until they accept one I don't doubt he could get one through congress but he would need some compromises. I prefer Rand Paul's tax plan the best where its a 15 flat tax but everyone gets like a 4,000 tax credit back so if you make 10,000 you would pay 1,500 but as your tax credit is 4,000 you pay 0. And if you make 100,000 you pay 15,000 but get back 4,000 so you would pay 11,000 essentially an 11% tax.

I can't remember Rand's exact numbers as his plan isn't relevent anymore but its similar to Trumps.

Trump's plan is first 25,000 (50k for married) income you earn is untaxed then he has a slight progressive income tax. I like this better than Ted and because its not complete flat but also doesn't ruin the upper middle class it could get support from both parties and won't need many compromises in congress.
I'm not. Facts are.

Big government, high spending, and putting people to work is the purview of Sanders just as it was for Eisenhower. They're extremely similar economically.

I'm all for moving the GOP away from nutcases like Ted Cruz who vote entirely for the religious/social Stance on everything, but if you want to bring back classic economic moderation (the classic Republican party pre-reagan) then Sanders fits the bill far more than Trump.
[deleted]
**THE**
I'm not sure I understand your point. How does applying these policies to the middle class hurt the middle class?
I don't think the establishment's plan anymore is to win decisively... They just need to keep Trump under a 50% majority so that they can dog-pile him at the convention. So far it seems to be working.
Crap.  My bad.  I meant to reply to /u/waldojim42.

For the record I entirely agree with you.  I wish there were more people that believed in the concept of limited government and still cared about income inequality.  Seems there are very few.
&gt; There is no way to bring up everyone to middle class

So I guess the 1950s was just a mirage.

&gt;He is pandering for the poor, not the middle class.

False.  See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/48z748/a_devils_advocate_question/d0tr813).
That sub has instantly started to ruin this one. Front page filling with memes and low effort selfposts.

And here I thought I could finally have a republican news feed on reddit without having to block /r/the_donald. Looks like unless things change, I'm just gonna have to filter this one too.
Thank you for this and this sounds a lot more accurate than other answers.  
To be fair though, meaning well when you're the commander in chief isn't going to make things better.
**HIGH ENERGY FLAUTIST**
I suppose downvotes are easier than providing evidence :) so far the facts stand against you, as always
True. I think it can be said that Reagan's ideas could've worked perfectly, if they were properly put forth. 
I certainly don't mind the Republican Party getting with the times when it comes to gay marriage and whatnot. Being super strict on social issues like that will never win a general election in this country anymore. I'll stick with the party as long as they stand by the US Constitution. That includes the 2nd Amendment which I believe to be very important. It's currently under siege by the Democrats.

Can we officially call ourselves **"The New Republican Party"**? Let's make that a hash tag!
I urge y'all to read [the autopsy mentioned in the article](http://goproject.gop.com/rnc_growth_opportunity_book_2013.pdf).  I read it when it was first published and at the time found myself agreeing with quite a bit of what it said.

I don't think the report was spot on about all of its points, but the GOP nearly wholesale ignored the report's recommendations and is now paying the price for that.
Ohio is contested mainly by Kasich/Trump, I wouldnt consider Cruz in the picture. Trump has an advantage (6% i think) but it can still go either way. It really comes down to the debate and how they run their campaigns next week.
This brings a tear to my eye. This is history in the making. It's about time the Republican party become HIGH ENERGY! Less focus on social conservatism and more focus on what really matters - the things that will make our nation strong and Make America Great Again!

Hi, social conservative here. However, I want to win the culture war culturally, not politically. So how about we be a socially moderate party? I won't push my socially conservative agenda on  you through the political process, but also please don't push a socially "progressive" agenda on me through the political process, either.

So I won't try to make abortion illegal. But how about we make sure I'm not having to pay for abortions via Planned Parenthood budgeting tricks?

I'm fine with state laws defining "marriage" however you want. But how about not applauding the Supreme Court for granting itself the authority to rewrite every state marriage law? And how about not forcing Christian bakers to bake gay wedding cakes? Let's just leave the government out of these things.

Basically, how about we call a truce on social issues in the political realm, and settle on "tolerance," but don't try to force "acceptance" on me? I'm never going to think a man in a dress is a woman. And I'm never going to be okay with schools teaching my kids that gender is a choice.

There are some good things about my patriarchy. If you're going to smash it, at least give me some evidence the replacement is not Islam, and is something that doesn't result in civilization-ending low birthrates.

Oh, and we're going to start saying "Merry Christmas" again.



It's not even about openly celebrating or endorsing what other people do in their own lives. It's about all Americans just being American and being proud to be so. We're all set with that PC bullcrap and we're all set with people being shitty to one another because their opinions differ. This movement isn't about segregating or tearing apart our nation, it's about Unity. Period. The only way America will ever be strong again is if we can come together as one to make the nation strong again. That means rebuilding our economy, WINNING ALL OVER THE PLACE, actually having borders and not having government interfere with everyday social concerns that people should have enough smarts to deal with on their own. Frankly, if people were just better human beings to each other, none of these social issues would have a peg to stand on.

The irony is that the new GOP is basically the old GOP of the ~70s- before the Reagan Revolution.

If you are too careless to get health insurance when you have a small child then it is very likely that you should not be having children. Please reconsider your life choices as I do not want to pay for your bad and selfish decisions-and neither should your potential children be suffer because their parents have no ability to delay immediate gratification.

Also - why is your country ruining the social and cultural homogeneity that has allowed this system to work as well as it has for as long as it has? If you like the system then why suicide it with waves of low-work ethic / high-rip-off-the-system immigrants? Strange, you must not want to continue with the system then... if you like my car you do not invite a rabid Rottweiler to ride in it with you. And if you do this then I cannot take your claims that you liked your car seriously. Please choose one.

Also also - "grew up in Sweden and Denmark" - implication is that they do not live their any longer. If your family wants socialism then go live in a socialist country. I don't want you here. You are no different than an Imam that wants to set up Sharia law in the us. We have a culture that we like. We don't want yours.
I don't think it'll be a second reincarnation of the_donald. At least, I hope not. I very much like Trump, but think that a lot of his ideas, as a lot of the ideas of others, can be used to change our party from the days of Bushes to a new day.

We haven't won a Presidential Election since 1952 without either a Bush or Richard Nixon. It's time to renew ourselves.
believed in *very* high taxes and non-interventionist foreign policy.  My kind of leader.
This is the republican party I have been waiting to see for a long time.  Religious identity politics were a toxic scourge tainting American freedoms and distracting from the real issues.
We must dispel this fiction that the American people are sick of that line.

I propose a name change to New Grand Party
Reagan brainwashed America by telling us, "Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." This quote isn't even true. Reagan loved government when it comes to forcing social issues on America like marijuana, gay marriage or abortion. But he absolutely hated government when it came down to economic issues. This dichotomy is, in my opinion, responsible for most of the problems we face today. 

* Healthcare: Government is making NOT make Healthcare a right. No govt option for people that are uninsured. No government protection means Big Pharma has stopped the ability to buy cheaper International drugs. Likewise the ability to not sell insurance across state lines has stopped competition. So the idea of less government regulation has defeated the free-market.

* College: Education has never been free. Government created public schools to allow people who could not afford private schools an education. The solution to fix college tuition is to have the government subsidize college again, like the subsidize k-12. Like they did back in the 40s and 60s when everyone could get a college degree for almost free. Lack of government action is the problem.

* Trade Deals: Reagan appointed Mr. Free Market Alan Greenspan to the Federal Reverse. Greenspan even served under the Clinton. That less government international free market idea created all the bad trade deals with have today. It allowed Clinton to repeal Glass-Steagall and not add derivative market oversight which created the 2007 crash.

* Current election: Fox News amplified his anti-government message to the point where the GOP is now unable to do anything besides obstruct, except on social issues of course. This crise of anti establishment movement was caused exactly because of him.  Trump is the only GOP candidate that has actual plans because the GOP politicians believe government is bad. Sanders is popular with a large percentage of the democrats because Reagan Democrats (Bill/Hillary/Obama) were shifted far to the right. 

I could go on about marijuana and drug laws or regressive judges like Scalia but I have made my point. A lot of the problems we have today are because people believe government is the problem. Truth is The Construction says that government is supposed to 'promote the general Welfare." We need a government that works. 
&gt; I won't push my socially conservative agenda on you through the political process, but also please don't push a socially "progressive" agenda on me through the political process, either.

We can do that for some issues but not others.

&gt;But how about we make sure I'm not having to pay for abortions via Planned Parenthood budgeting tricks?

That is not acceptable. A lot of the women can't afford abortions. What if they got raped and they can't afford the abortion. If they are young then their lives could be ruined by having a kid. If they are poor then you'll be stuck paying for social welfare. So it's cheaper to fund the abortion than pay years of food staples.  That is practical fiscal conservatism. 

&gt;But how about not applauding the Supreme Court for granting itself the authority to rewrite every state marriage law?

That doesn't work either. Either we have a federal government or we don't. If we allow all states to determines the laws for themselves then what is the point of a Federal government? If states right existed like conservatives want it, then a lot of states in the south would still have segregation, laws against gay marriage, abortion, etc. It would be a mess. 

&gt;I'm never going to think a man in a dress is a woman. And I'm never going to be okay with schools teaching my kids that gender is a choice.

I'm actually fine with that. I think that these issues are actually getting ignored by the GOP because they still keep focusing on abortion and gay marriage. 

&gt;Oh, and we're going to start saying "Merry Christmas" again.

Fine with me too. 
Don't fuck wit the NGP
That's the worst part. The social conservatives don't even cry about their *own* naughty parts. They're worried about *someone else's* naughty parts.

I feel like the majority of Americans should have to write this on the blackboard 100 times.
The evangelicals had their cute little moment in the spotlight with the Tea Party as part of the rebellion against Obama, but don't worry, I am fairly certain they're on the downward portion of their political trajectory. Most people are on board with the real issues you're talking about and are fed the fuck up with the divisive religious garbage that gets thrown around by the right.

Now if we could only convince the left that they do the exact same thing with race...

This is counter to the entire point of small r republican government. You're just basically trying to turn the Republican party into the Democratic party.

Carly Fiorina was a novelty when she was perceived as an effective business woman and former CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  Doubleplusgood that she was a woman, since the party has struggled hard with women in recent elections.

Then people began checking her history at HP and realized how poor a job she did and how she represented much of what was wrong with corporate America.

Don't see this being a huge boost for Cruz.
Well the Republicans back in Lincolns day are not the current Republicans now. If anything, Lincoln would be a Democrat today if he were alive. The party's flipped after the Civil War.

u/bomerr covered my opinions pretty well, but I just want to add a few things.

&gt;I won't push my socially conservative agenda on you through the political process, but also please don't push a socially "progressive" agenda on me through the political process, either.

There are some instances where this can't be the case. Marijuana is one. As long as it is illegal at the federal level, state reform will be hindered. I have no problem with states deciding to outlaw it individually (I don't agree with it, but I feel that is their right) but the issue here is it is *not* the role of the Federal Government to decide some of these things.

&gt;I'm fine with state laws defining "marriage" however you want. But how about not applauding the Supreme Court for granting itself the authority to rewrite every state marriage law? And how about not forcing Christian bakers to bake gay wedding cakes? Let's just leave the government out of these things. 

My personal view, and something I hope the New Republican Party picks up on, is that the government should only deal in unions, whether that's gay or straight (we should not get into the nonsense of polygamy or bestiality being considered a union; there is a line that has to be drawn). Let churches decide where marriage is acceptable. As far as the cake thing goes, I really don't understand why any government has any ability to tell any business who they have to do business with. I think businesses should have the right to refuse service to whoever they want whenever they want.

&gt;If you're going to smash it, at least give me some evidence the replacement is not Islam, and is something that doesn't result in civilization-ending low birthrates.

It would take quite a lot to crash our civilization due to low birthrates. Civilizations typically have to have a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of above 2.1 to grow (the 0.1 is to account for infant death rates), meaning a female must have two children to *sustain* the population. Civilizations typically see their Total Fertility Rates drop as they become more industrialized, and they will usually level out to around the 2.1 mark. For instance, our TFR is 1.9, while Sub-Saharan Africa has an average TFR of ~5.0 (eyeballing it). As the demand for resources in a region grows (read: more people wanting stuff) the price goes up, so the sustainability of more children is lessened. A civilization usually reproduces until it can't sustain itself with its resources anymore. **tl;dr: if our population dropped incredibly due to homosexuality (which is highly, highly unlikely), the straight people would just have more kids.**

&gt;ln the debates this cycle, I was halfway expecting Ted Cruz to trot out a gay person and hang them on stage just to prove how conservative he is

Cruz hasn't said a thing about gays in the debates this cycle.

&gt;Stop pandering to Evangelicals for support. We don't need them. They can either join the movement or get left behind.

Don't get ahead of yourself.

The Republican party absolutely needs Evangelicals. They are a huge bulk of Republican voters. However, most of them, like me, are not sold on social issues. Our primary concerns right now are stacked with immigration, foreign policy, and the economy. 

Don't act like Evangelicals are some tiny voter base and that they all vote the same, though. Sorry, but Trump not really caring about social issues isn't an excuse for you to exclude social conservatives from the Republican party. If Trump has a chance of winning it will be because of us together.
So what you're saying is Trump should disavow these people? I wonder why he hasn't already.
I hope Marco stays in until after FL gets to vote...  so we can crush him.
Supported Trump from the moment he took his stand on the wall. Here's my own views.

* Fuck the Establishment. And I realize that the Establishment includes a whole lot of globalists, neocons, corporate leaders, academics and even churches. It's a nasty little mix, and it's time to reduce their power.

* America First and Americans First policy. When Paul Ryan says he has to take into account the hopes and dreams of a guy living in Bangladesh when deciding on what kind of immigration policy we should have, Paul Ryan is establishing that he isn't fit for office. American trade policy is to be crafted with American citizens in mind - insisting about the 'net global gains' of this or that hypothetical policy mean little. Our foreign policy should start with self-respect, and then extend that respect to others conditionally, as befits our values and our mutual needs.

* I am a social conservative. Also, the B in the LGBT. But first and foremost, I am a foe of this political correctness bullshit that pops up more and more. SJW antics have no place being subsidized on public campuses - or in public, government funded facilities whatsoever. Let gays and lesbians and transgendered people and other people, crazy or no, live in peace, and let's put an end to denying others peace or trying to ruin them or get them fired just because they find same-sex 'marriage' inane, or they don't want to service a same-sex wedding. End the legal enforcement of PC and SJW groupthink now.

* An end to elitism, in favor of a meritocracy. No, we don't need to allow an endless stream of illegal immigrants owing to people being ready to scream 'racist!' otherwise. No, we don't need to tolerate a riot or crimes by people just because they're screaming 'Black Lives Matter' - and, for the record, All Lives Matter. No, we don't need to find a high paying position in the government for some idiot with a master's in political science who has a terrible track record with actually producing anything of value.

Let's make America great again.
Republicans need to unite or we fall, because despite what we label each other as, we are all Americans.
We are all apart of the same party here, I hope from now on if we post here we can all get along or if a debate happens, keep it civil. Other than that, hello everyone :D
AND
&gt; The only way America will ever be strong again is if we can come together as one to make the nation strong again.

And how do we do that? Strong morals, work ethic, and unified families.

&gt;That means rebuilding our economy

and how do we do that?  Strong morals, work ethic and unified families.

Isn't a bit ironic that the very same people you're defending are in bed with the total invasion of the west by third world migrants? the liberal agenda and gay agenda are very much the same. Their whole view of the world is anathema to yours. They'd rather have a chaotic social order, open borders, disintegrated families, degeneracy and generations of men who know no concept of work than to curb their own behavior.  
It's funny coming from 538 who was fawning over Rubio a month ago. Nate Silver has clearly lost his touch.

I'm not really into questioning policy specifics from that long ago.  Teddy Roosevelt was in my opinion an iconic larger than life character  and american hero who deserves his spot on mt. Rushmore. 

Eisenhower was a dignified statesman with an impressive war record. 

I'd say they both earned some respect and celebration by us,  despite tax policy. 

Most importantly I think we need to unite behind a simple message of MAGA. rather than squabble.

I'm not talking about homosexuality decreasing birthrates. I'm talking about the entire cultural Marxist agenda that undermines western civilization. The sum of feminism, no-fault divorce, promiscuity, birth control, abortion, etc that results in a degenerate society. All of our cultural institutions and traditions undermined result in people not getting married, having kids, and raising healthy families. People are barely having kids, and the kids they're having are a mess. Look at the generation of Bernouts people just raised.

Western civilization is dying. I'd prefer it not. Now I'm going to argue for strong cultural institutions and traditions to preserve our culture. I find Christianity has some pretty good ideas for producing strong families and societies. But I'm not going to try to *force* you to preserve our civilization via government. I'm asking we compromise by you not *forcing* me to pay for degeneracy that undermines the social fabric. Deal?
Exactly. Why this is being made an issue is beyond me.
He definitely expanded gov't while saying he didn't.  He wasn't all bad though.  I do appreciate him more for his popularizing of free markets in our culture.

That trade would be a bad deal. Evangelicals represent [25.4%](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/) of the population, while gays, lesbians, and bisexuals only account for [2.4%](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr077.pdf).

Uncompetitive Healthcare System?  Healthcare is nowhere near a free market in the U.S.  You've gotta be joking.

2007 Crash had to do w/ government subsidies and laws pressuring banks to loan money to those that couldn't pay it back.  That's, again, not a free market but government intervention in a free market.

Exactly! I have always believed as an Engineer there is no reason that you should be forced to go back for a teaching license after 30 years in your field and a professional license this goes for so many other fields.

"They're extremely similar economically." That's just plain ignorance. Then again, if you knew anything about economics, you wouldn't support Sanders.

Congressional Research Service concluded that the effective tax rate for the top 0.01 percent of income earners during the period of 91-percent income taxes was actually 45 percent. Given that the top bracket is so much lower today ($3,425,766 in 1955 vs. $413,200 in 2015), the 39.6 percent top marginal rate probably yields something pretty close. Another major factor was the myriad of deductions and loop holes that used to be available. The simple fact is that the rich never paid 90 percent of their income in taxes or anything even remotely close to that.

Every year since 1950, the government has collected between 16 to 20 percent of GDP in taxes. Has the burden fallen more on the middle and lower classes? Well, no. In fact, the percentage of taxes paid by the highest quintile of income earners has steadily gone up since 1980. In 1980, the top 20 percent paid about 55 percent of all income taxes. Today, it’s just shy of 70 percent. The same goes for the top 1 percent, which went from about 15 percent in 1980 to just shy of 30 percent today.

If you break it down by decade, the 50s have the lowest average of all recent decades, with annual receipts averaging actually slightly below 17 percent of GDP.

Cool, I'd hate to think that they couldn't get past their past - they're high profile adults, they should set an example.

Her giving praise to Trump shows that she's mature and conscientious, rational and reasoned (not the fact that she's giving praise, but that she's doing it after their bumpy history) - and not just hammering on him and being biased. I like middle-ground.

I agree with your point of strong family values because it empowers the nation and strengthens the people, but it should be derived from reason and not religion.

Well, ya want the short list, or the long one? I'll go for a summary overview.

I've watched Trump for years. Even before he announced his candidacy, I had already concluded based on his writings that he was a complete narcissist. He's obsessed with portraying himself as a great success, and this comes at the cost of actually communicating anything useful.

He changes parties every six years or so, has previously stated that he identifies more with the democrats, was pro-"choice" before mildly proclaiming himself to be pro-life, has donated a considerable amount of money to liberal politicians, sues half the people he meets and threatens to sue half the remainder, insults everyone, is crass and vulgar and an instigating agitator as the "coat" meme proves, and he lies constantly. He lies so much that no one even bothers to talk about it much anymore. He just says what he thinks the most angsty demographics want to hear, which is why he talks at a fourth grade level all the time. Honestly, I don't even know what there is to like about him.

I was concerned because you said that Christianity has some good ideas for producing strong families and societies, which sounds like pushing Christian values upon people.

His base was entirely theoretical from the start. The lab-assembled candidate the (political) scientists said would attract people to him like a magnet.
Therein lies the exact problem with courting evangelicals so strongly.  Twenty-five percent is a large enough figure to seem important but is so easily outnumbered by non-evangelicals that pandering to evangelicals becomes unwieldy in nation-wide elections.
About the 11 million, it might be as high as 30 million. And it's the fault of the people who came here illegally. We also need to end birthright citizenship. A least one parent must be here legally and not on something short-term like a tourist visa. 
Yes, but *not via government*. But stop fighting me with government because all the anti-christian, anti-family stuff is killing civilization.

My concern is that it's easiest to defend 2nd Amendment on the state level, but that we're expanding federal power to preempt state law. This is why I support marriage equality as a matter of policy but have reservations about enacting it via one-size-fits-all federal fiat.

Both Rs and Ds pay lip service to federalism when it suits them, but it's an indispensable cornerstone of American exceptionalism that I hope comes back into focus.
Gay marriage is a stupid issue for you to bring up. It wasn't passed through legislation it was decided by the Supreme Court. No one should be in favor of a handful of citizens making decisions for all of America.
I wouldn't abandon social conservatism, I'd just apply and think of it differently. I think social justice nonsense needs to be opposed because it is a way of undermining democracy in America, Canada and Europe. It's also a way to launder money. People are being paid to teach teachers how to supposedly properly treat racial and sexual minorities and their methods aren't being backed up by actual professional pediatricians or psychologists. They're telling workers they can't suspend or expel black students who threaten and assault people as an example of awful stuff that's ruining schools and causing teachers to flee elsewhere. You've got people being taught "no one is illegal" is an acceptable defense for illegal immigration and with enough illegals being given the power to legally vote or the means to easily fraudulently vote with increasingly lower voting requirements democrats can potentially be perpetually elected as they pander to them best or conservatives will be forced to pander to them. Candidates without Trump's charisma, name recognition, wealth and so on can be neutralized by baseless claims of racism and sexism.
Agree with you also. Social Conservatives, if you want to attempt a label on people I guess that one works, want to be left alone. I don't agree with the Supreme Court decision because I think the logic was not consistent, but I really am angry about making people participate in weddings that they don't want to. Seems it only goes one direction on this issue which is what is unfair. 
No one cares. You are implying having an opinion on what the definition of marriage is also means you care about sexual practices.
seems like the author is unfamiliar with conservatism. 
The source of all of that is pc culture and the sjw's. They are the causes of that.

One of the most likely results of Trump's nomination would be the neoconservatives breaking off from the GOP. I've read some commentators suggesting that they would try to join (or rejoin) the Democratic Party, based on a shared interest in globalist foreign policy.

Do you think most Democrats are receptive to that? I'm not sure how effective Sanders has been in attacking Hillary on this point, so D voters might not mind the new allies. It's even plausible to me that the new influence might push the DNC to the right on social issues.
I disagree. The 2nd Amendment is guaranteed to all citizens. States should not be able to circumvent the Constitution.
Who cares how someone else defines a marriage? Worry about defining your own marriage. Don't worry about Bobby and his husband, worry about you.
20 years from now there will be a documentary highlighting the improbable run Kasich takes to Pennsylvania Avenue. The documentary will start with his speech on March 15th after winning Ohio narrowly. It'll end with his face being added to Mount Rushmore.

On the other hand, lighting up the White House in rainbow colors while destroying the businesses of Christian bakers and florists is basically giving evangelicals the finger. There's a rich source of anger there that can be tapped into without bible thumping.
It's a constitutional right, but I don't like its odds in federal court. State law can and should be used as a source of gun rights, that way your eggs aren't all in one (hostile) basket.

Put it this way: if states' power to define gun rights are the focus, states  can keep and expand "shall issue" CCW policies. If the emphasis is on federal power to define gun rights, maybe *Heller* remains good law but you won't see more than that.

Tying back with my earlier point; I'll agree federal marriage regulations like DOMA should be struck down under federal constitutional law, and by extension a federal handgun ban should be struck down. When it comes to review of state law, I think state courts should decide the issue based on state constitutions first. Federal courts shouldn't rush in to decide issues with such broad implications, especially not when they're likely to define rights narrowly.
Agreed.
Republican ≠ Conservative
&gt; birth control

Woah, Cowboy! 

Birth control is contributing to a degenerate society? So I should be like the Duggars and have 19 kids and counting? Do you realize at the point that I pop out enough kids to start a hockey team, my partner and I will not have enough time or energy to spend on instilling core values into our kids? They will be "just raised" like the Bernouts. And unless we are multi-millionaires, we won't have enough money to pay for these kids and will have to go on Welfare? How does that help our country's debt problem?

I only want somewhere between 2 and 4 kids. If I happen to reach 4, I'm going on birth control. Do you think the government should be actively involved in preventing me from using birth control because you consider it degenerate? 

I thought most conservatives were for limited government control of our lives.

Birth Control is fine as long as I'm not paying for it.
By and large I consider myself to be a progressive, yet I find myself agreeing with many of your tenants outlined here. I feel that good politics shouldn't be arguing so much about *what* we should be doing, but rather *how* we should be doing it. Partisanship has grown to the extreme - to the point where even a self-described "moderate" would have a hard time finding where to stand because there's just so much disconnect between the two sides...

"the two sides"...those words alone irk me, too. Hopefully you would also agree that we would benefit by opening up elections to more than just "one or the other".

Anyway, here's to hoping we can topple the old ways and try again, having learned a little from our past.
Hell yeah.  End the war on drugs and lay off the domestic spying, since they both contribute to jackboot police and wasted money, and I'm fucking IN.  Militarized cops don't like the 2nd Amendment, anyway. 
I agree. I wouldn't expect someone to pay for my birth control.

&gt;That is not acceptable. A lot of the women can't afford abortions. What if they got raped and they can't afford the abortion. If they are young then their lives could be ruined by having a kid. If they are poor then you'll be stuck paying for social welfare. So it's cheaper to fund the abortion than pay years of food staples.  That is practical fiscal conservatism. 

There is no reason that government has to fund abortions.  This could easly be done through nonprofits.  I don't really give a shit one way or the other but we need a common sense compromise.  If the evangelicals are at a point where they are no longer trying to outlaw it but just don't want to fund it, that seems reasonable and workable to me.



nonprofits need to get the money from somewhere too.

like i said, as a society it is cheaper to fund an abortion than pay years of food stamps (EBT)
&gt;I was concerned because you said that Christianity has some good ideas for producing strong families and societies, which sounds like pushing Christian values upon people. 

Have we gotten to a point where it is unacceptable to praise Christianity at all? I don't care if you believe or not but ask yourself this, who has advocated atheism?  The Cultural Marxists have been trying to weaken the foundations of society.  They hate religion because it unites people into a community. 

Again, if you don't believe that is fine but I wish people would question the motive behind the vilification of  Christianity in our higher ed and the msm.  One can be an atheist and still respect and even defend the sociatial value of organized religion.
People donate? Like they already do to PP. Besides they have made it clear that tax payer funds do not fund abortions, right? So the money must be coming from elsewhere.

You're stuck in the idea that if the government doesn't do something to solve a social problem, it will never get done. 
The culture war is more important than fiscal conservatism.  Albeit edge cases.

Like Andrew Brietbart said, politics is downstream from culture.
It's not realistic to except people to donate to an nonprofits specifically designed to fund planned parenthood abolitions year after year, decade over decade to solve a social problem. So yes without government funding that problem will exist. 
The culture war is dead. Trump killed it. He avoids abortion. gay marriage or even weed. As Trump would say those are all losing battle for losers. Abortion ended 40 years ago, gay marriage last year and weed is in progress.  The only culture war battle left is Political Correctness. 
There are plenty of charities that are funded at orders of magnitude above pp's budget.  I don't see lack of private funding ever being an issue.
Okay. Setup the charity, get the donors and if the operation if the income is large enough to pay for the entire country then I'll agree the govt should not fund pp. 
We are seeing a split within the evangelical community.  The majority of them, who are voting for Trump, are willing to give up on the idea of legislating morality.  But just like you don't want anyone preaching hellfire to you, these evangelicals don't want their children to be taught queer gender theory in school.  And that is the deal Trump is offering them.
I don't care how someone else defines a marriage. Doesn't make it correct though.
The culture war is not dead. Look how many posts you see of college kids saying how they are afraid to come out as Trump supporters.

I am focusing on the fiscal conservative argument of government funding (from tax payers) for abortions rather than food stamps. If there is a pre-determined amount of abortions each year, then yes you can calculate how much it would cost to raise that child with food stamps versus pay for that abortion.

However, there is no pre-determined amount of teenage pregnancies or poor women becoming pregnant (I am excluding cases of rape and incest for sake of this argument). Fighting the culture war to discourage unwanted pregnancies in the first place by people who would otherwise get an abortion saves the most money.

In conclusion, I argue that fighting the culture war yields less abortions, less government.

You are right in that they are losing issues, but I think it is foolish to put issues like these aside and say okay we will concede and move on because you can be certain that the left has more and more issues that it will be bringing up and fighting for in the future if you begin conceding.
&gt;In conclusion, I argue that fighting the culture war yields less abortions, less government.

Political Correctness aka supporting Trump has nothing to do with abortions and less government. 

&gt;I think it is foolish to put issues like these aside and say okay we will concede and move on because you can be certain that the left has more and more issues that it will be bringing up and fighting for in the future if you begin conceding.

The issues today are trasngender/cross-dressing kids using bathrooms. 

Ironically clinging to old issues like abortion and gay marriage weakens the point on these new issues.  
&gt; It's not realistic to except people to donate to an nonprofits specifically designed to fund planned parenthood abolitions year after year, decade over decade to solve a social problem.

One third of PP's funding, $390 million, comes private donations [1]. And besides, government funds can't be spent on abortions anyways. So any and all abortions are funded outside of the government [2].

2. http://www.factcheck.org/2011/04/planned-parenthood/

&gt; So yes without government funding that problem will exist.

We already do have government funding PP (outside of abortion) and the problem does exist. In fact it isn't getting better.

This I gotta agree with, though I personally know gay people and don't have anything against them as people. The "legalization" was yet another thing made possible from SCOTUS judges legislating from the bench, ruling on how things "ought to be" not as they're written. The legalization of gay marriage should have come from an actual law or amendment to the Constitution, not a supreme court ruling or god forbid an Obama "executive order"

You down with NGP? Yeah you know me!
Evangelicals have led the Republican Party around by its nose since the rise the Moral Majority in the 80's. The Southern Strategy is built around courting evangelicals. It's disingenuous to imply that their influence on the GOP is a recent phenomenon or had anything to do with Obama. 
The owners of this sub posted on a sticky for the_donald.  Trust me when I say nobody is going to stay here for the meme's, the_donald has that.  It was just a quick hello, the last post on this sub before mine was 4days ago.... Hardly taking up all the air in the room.
America is strong, and America is great. Always has been, always will be. It's pathetic that some candidates have to tear our country down just to make themselves look better. 
OK, so?  [how about this?](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/03/devastating-rubio-rallies-to-empty-stadium-at-hialeah/)
Making the Religious Right a centerpiece of the GOP is one of the things I think Reagan faltered on pretty hard.
This is also what I'd like to see.  The moderate Evangelicals I think bring a lot to the table for the GOP, but I think the hardcore, no-compromises Evangelicals create a lot more problems than they solve.
No. I'd rather Lincoln not decided to wage a war of aggression against the South. I realize that you've been taught the government's side of the story, as well as, much propaganda regarding the War Between the States, but please try to keep in mind that the issue of slavery was quite complex and *not* the sole reason for the conflict.
Eh, that kind of identity politics is what I think the GOP needs to get away from.

And I mean both sides.
What are some of his lies that bother you the most? 
This is how I've felt this entire election cycle.  It is *so* refreshing to see candidates running on actual governmental policy without social/moral issues figuring heavily into their platforms.

I'm more than glad to have religious folks in the party, but the constant pandering to their vocal bloc painted the party into a corner.
Slavery was the sole issue behind secession. Each confederate state ratified articles of secession that said so. There wouldn't have been a civil war without secession. 
I am glad he isn't going.  It isn't like he would go to pay his respects. 

I remember at Regan's funeral bill and hillary fell asleep.
The amount of plotting and scheming going on behind closed doors is getting a bit scary. These are devious people with the backing of near limitless resources. I just don't trust it at all.

Pity he wasn't this edgy when he was running. 
He was funny when he roasted all the candidates on Christmas and called Sanders comrade.
Why do you immediately jump to government force?

Birth control screws up your hormones. Makes women fat, unhealthy, moody. This screws up marriages, too.

No, I'm not going to *force* you to not be a degenerate. But I'm also not going to sit here and applaud your degeneracy, nor am I going to consent to paying for it via any proposed government programs. 
Those states had every right to secede.

I'm in no way inclined to argue with you on the issue. But I thought Republicans were against the idea of an obtrusive, controlling federal government? Lincoln's war against the South was the ultimate overreach of government, was it not?
Exactly. People worry about autonomous work sources but that's always been a concern. People worried about the cotton gin, hell most people don't remember that 'spreadsheets' were called  hat because they used to spread a huge sheet out on a table and have the simple calculations done by hand. Now you can do the work of 10 people by pulling s cursor across an xls ss, and it has lead to more productivity overall because now you have all the jobs surrounding the software itself 
First, I never made any statement about whether the states had a right to secede. The constitution has no mechanism for states to leave Union, only to join it. There's arguments to be made on both sides of that issue, though, so maybe they did and maybe they didn't. The fact remains that every confederate state seceded in order to protect the institution of slavery.

Second, since the southern states did secede from the union and if one accepts that they had the right to do so then Lincoln's actions weren't taken against states and American citizens but foreign powers and aliens occupying disputed territory. The president has a duty to uphold the constitution and in my opinion Lincoln saw his duty as preserving the union as it existed through the process of ratifying states. 

I was born and raised in the Deep South. I've seen all the sides of the issue. The way I see it there's no way a southern nation would have been able to survive economically or socially. A society dependent on slavery to preserve a purely agrarian economy would have failed. When Lincoln referred to a house divided he was talking about the U.S. as well as the confederacy. 

I'm no Republican but I sincerely hope that a president from either party would make preserving the union his or her top priority. 
There was definitely a recent surge, though, but I did forget about the Moral Majority. My hatred for Cruz blinded me.
I care about what is "correct" for me in my life, and a government that doesn't force upon me or others what is correct in theirs. The government shouldn't be "defining" anything for anyone except what qualifies for certain tax statuses. 
So then, waging a destructive and vicious war against the South was "preserving the Union"? That's Orwellian, is it not?

The institution of slavery could have (and would have) been ended without resorting to violence, as it was in most of the world, if not for Mr. Lincoln's insistence on brutally punishing the South.

Incidentally, the institution of slavery had already existed for eleven thousand years worldwide and involved enslaving every race before it was ended *by people of European descent* approximately a hundred and fifty years ago.

That was awesome! I mean, would have been better if Scott had just agreed, but good for him for not doing the PC thing.

Yes, in general, Islam is an ideology that does not share really any of the values of America, and the US constitution is completely incompatible with Islamic teachings.
"Won't Get Fooled Again" ~ The Who
Exactly how I see it.  It would be unfair to wrap all Muslims up in one basket and say they all hate America.  Completely untrue.  Islam however is an ideology, it is a way of thinking and in it's most fundamental state it is completely incompatible with both Christianity and the founding principles of the USA.  It is only when you are run by true fascists that it is not okay to question an ideology in this way and props to Gov. for standing up for it in my opinion.

I do agree that certain statements that could be considered racist that have no real value to any debate should be shunned, however I'm concerned with the blanket topic of "racism" as 'against the rules'.

In colleges and more liberal leaning areas a great deal of censorship is taking place under the guise of "preventing/discouraging racism" when it's simple discussion of facts in studies and the like. 

Do you have a more concise definition of how racism and trolling will be considered?

It seems like ancient history now but Cruz and Trump are the fruits that grew from seeds planted by [Lee Atwater](http://www.thenation.com/article/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/) way back in 1981. 

The surge you speak of came from the Bush Hangover, Obama Derangement Syndrome, and lack of leadership within the GOP. Strong party leadership never would have allowed the Tea Party to hijack the conservative agenda nor would it have allowed the rise of Donald Trump. It feels like nobody is driving the bus and it's about to go over a cliff. 
As opposed to the faction of his supporters that want to jail gay people, or worse...
I'm really praying to God you guys are right and that Trump can step up the vocabulary a bit and deliver a Reagan quality speech: ["A Time for Choosing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXBswFfh6AY).  I think Trump is smart.  I just wish he'd exercise his intelligence more often.
Rand should've been much more outspoken and dominant when he was campaigning. 

If he was, and was on top from the start (getting his message out to people) I believe he could be contesting Trump.  
That entire segment was clearly a drive-by hit piece on Scott to lure him into making remarks that support Trump and that could be later spun as racist.  

I mean, what kind of shitty question is that to ask a governor?  Do you think Florida Muslims hate America?  It was a loaded, identity-baiting question designed to get a response that could be used for a damaging sound bite later.
Birth control affects each woman differently. It depends on the kind of birth control used too. Do condoms make women fat, unhealthy, and moody? By the way, not all women get fat from the pill (which I take it is what you consider unhealthy?), *And* the pill can actually make some women less moody - I have a friend whose relationship was literally saved by taking birth control. 

You never mentioned anything about paying for birth control in your original post - only that you are against birth control in general. While I am all for paying for my own birth control because it's the responsible thing to do, taking birth control is also the responsible thing to do. 

You never responded to what happens when people don't take birth control, have more kids than they can afford, and then need welfare. You don't want to pay for birth control but you are ok paying for other people's babies?

Birth control is not degenerate. It is the responsible thing to do.
Not for just posting here. 
I like Ted but he is wrong on this. People are supporting Trump because he plays dirty and they want to see Hillary beaten down  in an election. 
It doesn't really matter what you do, no one cares. I'm just saying definitionally it's not correct.
The issue isn't that you believe it's not correct. That's your opinion and you're entitled to it. The issue is people like Kim Davis thinking they can impose their opinion on others.
I would use 'islamisim'/'islamists' or 'political islam' instead of characterizing all of Islam as anti west.

More "Vanilla" islam, like is practiced nearly everywhere except the arab world, is more or less compatible.

It's the brand of islam that seeks to establish a theological social/political state that is absolutely incompatible with western society (and any other system of social/political organization).  It's a social and political meme that advocates for polygamy (which causes gender imbalance, women to become guarded property, and crime/warfare on the part of uninvested males with no chance for reproduction), death to those that think, severe corporal punishment for minor crimes, and replaces sexual gratification with self-mutilation and suicide.
&gt; like is practiced nearly everywhere except the arab world

Would that include India? The Philippines? Thailand?

Everywhere there is Islam, it is at war with everything that is not Islam, or is a different type of Islam.
I miss Rand, he's really the only one I liked. His campaign was pretty awful though. Hopefully he continues his good work in the Senate. 
Islamic Modernism like the kind practiced in the largest Muslim-majority country in the world, Indonesia, is not much more extreme than Catholicism.
And I attribute Cruz support to "retardation" and "low energy"
Kasich is a bad governor. 
&gt; His campaign was pretty awful though.

That's part of my problem with him, he has great ideas but he doesn't make good decisions.

He might not like Trump but he has no reason to fight against the only guy that could take down the establishment and make it possible for a libertarian to win.
MSNBC isnt even hiding the fact that they're a shitty network hell bent on pushing liberal agendas anymore. They have nothing better to do with their time than run hit pieces, because journalism means nothing to them anymore. 
Well he's not wrong....

No matter which candidate you support in the GOP primaries it's certain that things have changed since Trump started his campaign, on both sides of the spectrum.  I wonder what the consensus is on Obama's part in all this though.  Is it overall dissatisfaction with his presidency, or is it something that's been a long time coming, and related to the entire political scene in America/The World?
Rand is establishment now. The truth can hurt. 
In a broader sense: please. As if Obama isn't lined up behind TPP, the PC culture, endless immigration, sanctuary cities and more? He's 'to blame'.

As is the GOP for largely the same reasons. Further, Obama's talking about this almost purely with the ground assumption that Trump is an evil, hateful quasi-Hitlerian racist-monster with no valid complaints.
He forgot to include single men without children who jerk off to anime.  In other words, the majority of men in America.  But everyone knows Ted Cruz gets all of his information and answers from The Bible.  He'll tell you that himself.
I consider myself an old conservative, but everyone knows that "'He who must not be named" is why Republicans have had a hard time in the past elections as well as will have in present and future elections.  That 80,000 pound gorilla on Jeb's back is the reason why Jeb's campaign was over before it began.  Jeb would have gained a lot more respect if he would have just thrown his brother under the bus and claimed to be his own man instead of defending his brother.
I think even Democrats have realized that Democrats and Republicans are 2 sides of the same coin.  Things aren't going to change by recycling the same old politicians.  It's no longer Democrats vs. Republicans.  It's "The Establishment" vs. "The Outsider".  You've had those feelings stirring since the Ross Perot days, but it still takes money as well as name recognition to run a successful campaign.
Establishment in the sense he is a reelected politician but the Paul Ryans and the Mitch McConnels of the GOP do NOT agree or get along with Rand Paul.  "Established" but not "establishment."  He is not part of the elite inner circle of the GOP 
They're both at fault. 
Both Obama and the GOP are at fault here, though I think it goes back farther than Obama.

Let us not forget how sharply W divided the country.  I have seen few presidents as polarizing and mocked as he was.  It was his divisiveness, in fact, that I think helped Obama attain the presidency.  Recall his messages of hope, change, and unifying the country.

We all see how that turned out.  Obama simply deepened those divides, and to the point that I feared the country might not be able to come back from it.  All that for what turned out to be a fairly weak president :/

Just as the Dems turned W's presidency into an Us vs Them affair, the GOP in response to Obama began to edge further to the right in what became essentially a series of schoolyard confrontations.  They earned themselves the unenviable sobriquet of "The Party of No".

That was all fine and good, except they never had any ideas or backbone of their own.  "Anti-Obama" literally became a campaign platform for those running for congress, nevermind their lack of actual ideas or substance.

All that divisiveness and inaction, along with the rise of the Tea Party and hardcore right, painted the GOP into a corner that almost banished it to irrelevance.

That IMO set an absolutely prime chessboard for Trump to show up and lead an outright revolution.
I agree with Cruz on this, 100%.  Please downvote me.  It's a lot easier than justifying why you would vote for Trump.
[removed]
It wasn't Obama that deepened the divide any more than it was Bush.  It's the whole "We need to win", and escalation of warfare that has increased the divide.

If my opponent argues an extreme position, I should argue a MORE extreme position!  In fact, the more shocking I can be, the more recognized I will be.

It isn't about helping the country.  It's about winning by being the most extreme, sticking your head up the furthest as everyone fights to be loud and absurd.
To start everytime he gets called out for saying something incredibly offensive he lies and lies about not saying it and then when the video is she on he just shrugs it off.  I also find his actions on stage pretty offensive when it comes to a Presidential candidate and leader of our great nation. Everytime he is up there I feel like I'm watching an SNL skit and while funny is not what I want in the White House.
Maybe he just realizes that we're all tired of the bullshit. I'm tired of politically correct speech. If you want an example of Trump being presidential, just watch his speech after his Super Tuesday win at his place in Florida. 
#Manlet brought the bants
I completely agree that the focus on one-upsmanship and an ever increasing pandering to the base of "see how hardcore I am!" is a large driver of where we are now. Cannot be understated. 
I feel bad calling him that because his shortness makes him so cute 
OK then maybe he should admit to it instead of lying until he is caught. I don't feel I can trust him and don't like his attitude. 
Rick Scott will probably be getting Trump's VP slot. Watching this "interview" this morning solidified that in my mind. He isn't going to do or say anything to jeopardize it. 
First thing is that O-bombs is really just trying to throw some shade on Trump. Nothing more.



That said.

The Tea Party movement is really a counter-movement against the people who brought Obama and all of his let's change america rhetoric into office (It wasn't JUST the Obama movement but I think that was the final straw). That movement is one of the major forces that has been captured under the umbrella of the trump movement. That being said, the Tea Party is still divided between trump and cruz. 


What is potentially VERY significant about the Trump movement is that it will be a key factor in defining Obama's legacy. The movement's existence in the first place already indicates that Obama's presidency will be strongly associated with exacerbating (and possibly taking advantage of) cultural/religious/racial tensions within America. If It succeeds and if Trump or even Cruz (aka the zodiac killer) become Pres next year Obama may be chalked up as worst since Jimmy Carter.  


In my opinion a key part of this election is that it is going to become a referendum on the Obama Legacy. Trump (and Cruz but increasingly less so) are leading the charge that something is profoundly wrong. Meanwhile, Hillary is saying that everything is just fine. If Hillary loses the election then Obama's reputation is toast imho.
Let's keep quoting liberal Washington shipost that will show Trump.
refute the substance
It is *not* just the Trump supporters they treat like crap.  The mods in /r/Conservative have a power trip going on.

Their leader (/u/TK-85) gave me a  4 day ban for this post (unedited):
&gt; Google "trump". Take your pick. /sigh fanboy blindness

When I complained to the other mods for the ban /u/ayePALINDROMEeye responded with this:

&gt; Guess what? We don't give a shit. It's a 4 day ban. Get over it. If you reply to this I'll make it 7. 

That was in response to a rather long, but polite letter complaining that /u/TK-85 should not be allowed to moderate responses to his own posts.

I suggested (and received) a 70 day ban instead.  I'm fine with that - I have no desire to associate with petty vindictive mods.
Glad to see all the positive energy in this sub again!
Funny you mention him. AyePalindromeeye is currently trolling me via PMs since he's banned from here for trolling. LOL. 
Can you give me an example? Like a video?
We can disagree about a definition, it doesn't matter. All I'm saying is the definition of marriage I use is from Christianity and probably other traditions in general. I have no idea where your definition comes from. Kim Davis did nothing wrong she has the right as an American to abstain from things that violate her religious conscious. Especially as a public employee she is granted constitutional protection of her religion. 
No, if her religious beliefs get in the way of her job then she needs to resign.

Obama is establishment. Both the Republicans and Democrats have a stake in keeping the establishment candidates from either side in power. Trump isn't perfect, but he's the best option available of the 6 candidates still vying for the White House.
[deleted]
Sort of, but not in the way Doughhat (sp) means. If the Democrats hadn't been pushing so much on illegal immigration, it wouldn't be as big an issue. As well, the Democrats and Republicans seemed to reach a combined donor-class consensus on free-trade, neo-con foreign policy, and the desirability of rapid immigration. This allowed someone who is less (so far) reliant on donations from the billionaire donor-class to stake out popular positions that were otherwise abandoned.

TlDR; just giving people hope that he's breaking with the elite concensus has helped him become popular.
Actually Sharia law enjoys enormous support in [Indonesia](http://m.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/05/02/seven-10-indonesian-muslims-want-sharia-law-pew-study.html), Malaysia, and pretty much everywhere there are large numbers of Muslims. It's true that Wahhabism emanating from Saudi Arabia is a particularly virulent, somewhat ahistorical form of Islamic extremism, but it's a fact that beliefs incompatible with liberal democracy are near-universal among observant Muslims, such as the belief that blasphemy against Islam should be punished, that apostates and atheists should be executed,  beliefs about the submission of wives to husbands, and the desire to make Islamic laws the law of the state. There are very many people who identify as Muslims drinking alcohol and eating pork, but the idea that there's some vast ocean of observant Muslims who've found a way to make Islamic beliefs truly compatible with respecting the rights of other groups and peacefully accepting plural democracy for every one who wants a global caliphate is bullshit peddled by dishonest apologists like Reza Aslan.

Breitbart has always supported Trump and has always been anti PC  

That is why this is shocking. 
This writer is doing what so many others have done:  Accuse Trump of riding a perceived wave of semi-racist nationalism into the White House while having little real substance.

Patently false, of course, which can be easily seen by [visiting his web page outlining his positions](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions).

The writer then goes on to blame corrupt, inefficient, and agenda-financed bureaucrats for Washington's ailments.  He offers lots of platitudes about how we need better government with better public servants but offers no real solution to get there and instead uses it as a platform to vaguely claim that Trump won't accomplish it without giving any reasons to support the claim other than "Trump racist!".

It's too bad, as I actually agree with several of the writer's points, but it's a fluff piece primarily meant to skewer Trump rather than convey any real information or alternate ideas for the path forward.

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

And Congress wouldn't be making that law. It's the law of common sense. If you can't do your job, resign. 

Heaven forbid an atheist in her position declare that *no* marriage licenses be issued to anyone because they don't believe in marriage.
I believe in the superiority of the American race.
Trying to get these people to think for themselves and actually examine these accusations of racism is like arguing with feminists.  

At some point you have to realize that you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.  There are going to be armies of buthurt liberals roaming the country with bright shirts and megaphones if Trump is elected President.  Know it and accept it.  The consolation is you might actually get an economy.  

Quite honestly, I'd fully support a candidate who openly used the word "Wetback" if they could fix the economy and end corruption in politics. 

Would I agree with the use of the word?  No.  But offended people don't pay the fucking bills.
This strategic voting, "anybody but Trump" stuff is going to rip the party apart. 
Damn son. 
Oh no, not Christians practicing what they believe! Those filthy fundies won't even give us enlightened few the respect to call them hypocrites this time! Don't they know they should cheat on their wives and make dirty business deals instead. /s
An atheist could do that under the 1st ammendment. It would be weird because you've already argued religion is not related to marriage. But the constitution protects everyone's religious exercise including atheists'.

This can't be news, right? I agree it makes him look bad but he's already well known in Ohio. Shouldn't this have come up in his earlier races? Granted in other states where he's still building an image this would be an issue.
I was excited about Carson running for president for a few years now, but it started becoming evident that he's more interested in becoming the surgeon general than the president.  Why else would he support the man who at this point seems likely to become the next president, even though Trump and Carson are radically different politically?

That being said, I can't think of anyone who would be a better surgeon general, so I guess I'm OK with it.  Still hoping that Ted can beat Trump, though.
Honestly I didn’t think they were that different politically.

Who cares what this poaching piece of shit has to say
He doesn't poach. 
STUMP
I posted his tweet on my Facebook. Caught some shit but argued that he was standing up for free speech and most seemed to accept that. Fuckin' THIN ICE we walk on. These mommy's boys get offended by the tiniest shit!

This could not be more dead on.
Good. Real good. Like "Tony Robbins" good. 
Juvenile and inappropriate, but I still laughed.
If she gets indicted and kicked out of the race (unlikely for the second one), then it'll be Bernie against Donald.  That would not be NEARLY as entertaining as watching Donald eviscerate the Witch. :)
Explain it like I'm stupid, which I am, please.
He's not supporting trump, he's just saying that trump supporters have every right to vote for who they want as anyone else. 
All wrapper means is porting what you've done to another platform, I think 

I'm pretty sure you can do what you did as a website in JavaScript 
oh how cute, you made a little rhyme ....geez 
I have a website, too, butterymancakes.com
tl;dr: "can we somehow find a way to squash the voices of people who support trump? he has started a race war, all of the violence brought against him is his fault."
I think people like Cruz are being a bit naive. BLM protests everything and they are often violent. The main reason Cruz hasn't had this at his rallies, is because he's way behind.

If he was in the lead, the mainstream media would talk about him more, compare him to fascism more, and his rallies would attract more interest from the left. And then Rubio would be all, "gosh, Cruz should temper his anti-immigration rhetoric if he doesn't want to create this culture of violence at his rallies."

Cover your damn mouth when you cough, woman! I've been fighting a cough for two weeks and no one wants that stuff flying all over the place.
How in the world did he even get that close to him?  Secret Service dropped the ball on that one in my opinion.
This is not a first amendment violation and the article even states as much before simply turning around and saying it was a violation.

There was no government intervention here. Trump's first amendment rights weren't violated by the protestors and the protestors were exercising free speech.

Where things diverged is when the protest turned violent. Then it is no longer a protected event and it can begin violating criminal laws depending on what people are doing. Destroying property is illegal and not free speech. Physically attacking people is illegal and not free speech. Burning the American flag, walking all over it, or flying it upside are not illegal and are free speech. Impeding emergency vehicles is illegal and not free speech. Assembling to protest is legal (usually) and free speech (usually).
That's a scary one...

Exactly, these events tend to be open to the public, undermining much of the article's argument.
He's gotta be behind Glenn Beck too. 
Beyond dropped the ball. Had the man had a deadly weapon and followed through to lunge he would have hit him.
Buuuuut nobody's saying they don't have the right; at most, people are saying they *shouldn't*.
That's not exactly "sticking up for Trump".
And yet the candidate excoriates conservative positions. Funny that.
Ya, sure Italy. Everything else has worked so well in efforts to stop him so go ahead and endorse her.
If he had wanted to that could have ended in death, definitely a worry I bet some SS Agents got a bollocking over that.

The clear loser, John Hilly, is grammar. 
She is choking on all her lies.
Well sure because most countries are afraid Trump is going unveil and stop their crap. Take China as a prime example. 
Yeah, I mean he had time to address him and everything.
No
yet another reason to vote TRUMP
killin' is cheap if you're female...**FIVE** years?

I don't see how and I sure hope not
Outstanding!
Breitbart is a click-baity cesspool of half-truths and outright lies.
Trump's foreign policy is exactly why I like him. If he became any more hawkish I don't think I could carry on advocating and campaigning for him.
I have a hard time believing this video was literally buried underground.
:-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)
#MAGA !!!!
Trump is the only one with foreign policy that makes sense.

I listen to Cruz, Rubio, and Kasich telling us how we need to arm some middle eastern country. Every time we arm one of these countries, we either are giving weapons to the enemy or creating another enemy. Do they not remember how al-Qaeda was created?
Anyone but Clinton at this point, seriously.
Guess the White House doesn't give 'A for Effort' awards.
I don't follow his every move, but I liked Ben Shapiro. I thought he was hands-down impressively brave with his recent college speech moves. Braver than Milo even, who I respect enormously - Milo has yet to brave a near-riot and take a police escort, unless I'm mistaken.

But his beef with Breitbart seems to transparently be about his opposition to Trump. Yes Breitbart has done a good share of Trump boosting. Frankly, so what? They're one of the few bits of major conservative media to do so. Saying it's horrible because Trump is a 'bully' is not just bullshit.
Right, so he has a disagreement and that makes it okay to destroy the award they were giving a 79 year-old man. What a bottom feeder.

Looks like he killed himself in 2010: http://www.northcoastjournal.com/NewsBlog/archives/2010/09/28/rip-rick-springer-anti-nuke-activist-reagan-assaulter-former-humboldter

Now that they're starting to realize that protesting inside is a crime, they don't want to take the risk.
I think your right and Trump has suggested that he might start pressing charges. I think he should, most of these people are paid by Soros to disrupt the Trump rallies and they will stop doing it if they will be faced with arrest, bail and fines. 
[Sorry the video evidence shows she was lying](https://youtu.be/6NoMPxomjiw) 

They made the right choice. 
You wouldn't think so if you turned on CNN. They are wall to wall with 'Trump's Violent rally" coverage. Their desperation to heavily paint a narrative based on a handful of incidents makes me want to actually vote for the guy. 


The lines between reporting and advocating mean nothing to them.
what... WHAT!

this has to be a joke, a really really terrible joke?

she is literally lying through her teeth now and doesnt even give a shit.
Nasty liar. Sad.
If he sweeps all but Ohio, he won't need Ohio.
[deleted]
Ohio is not a must-win if he wins the rest today. He will still be well on track for the nomination even without Ohio, but goddamn would it be sweet to get 1-point win in Ohio and take all the delegates, /r/conservative would be on permanent suicide watch.
LOL Yes, Mittens. Keep talking. 
here's the thing (very often repeated by Rush Limbaugh)

the left doesn't want to win/defeat the right

the left seeks to **permanently DESTROY** all opposition 

while we play around, the enemy is AT WAR
I forgot who is this guy again?
I still don't know what to make of Trump, but the fact that the republican establishment, the democrats, and the media are all scared out of their minds about him has me very intrigued.
Perhaps he should reconsider his ideas to defund planned parenthood if he's so fuckin concerned for women.
Bush did a pretty great job at destroying the party rather than McCain or Mitt.
Yes, the rhetoric is strong, but that is a necessary evil in politics. This is not his first run at POTUS; he learned the hard way that voters do not make choices based on cold analysis of policies and plans, they make choices based on perceived emotional connections with candidates. He's playing the game he needs to play in order to win.

He's not an ideologue, he's a pragmatist. He's tough, he's never let failure turn him into a quitter, he's put tens of thousands of people to work, and he's an empire-building businessman who literally wrote the book on tough negotiating. He's exactly what our country needs.

#M A G A#
I assume you mean Jr. &amp; Sr., or can Jeb share some blame too?
[deleted]
Sr. coat tailed harder than any previous president, which wasn't bad. Jr. may have very well been a key part of the recession and grown frustration with the current republican party. Jeb showed that the legacy part of the party is completely disconnected. Romney got the boot end of peoples frustration, he's hardly the problem and would have been fine in office.
The Trump campaign has a hard ceiling of ~~20%~~ ~~30%~~ ~~40%~~ ~~50%~~ 60%!
Please in the name of Kek I hope they do. This would be the end of the GOP.
Seems like clickbait.  Was there a link to the actual poll?  I really couldn't make head nor tails out of who they actually polled.  They just referred to "Republican primary voters", but that's a category that only makes sense after people have voted.  Until then they are at best "likely" voters, but it's not clear to me that's what the article is saying.  Maybe they polled people who already voted in primaries?
Well he won big, now what?
Don't you have to win at least 8 states to be considered for the nomination in a brokered convention? 
Yes, as the rules are written now, but they can just change the rules at the convention.
They won't be able to stop him.
Wow, that number is...**Putinesque!** ^(*twirls moustache*)
That person wouldn't fall under his plan to begin with, correct?
Narco forgot to clean up that little pile he left on his desk.
[deleted]
Agreed, I don't want to sound all "muh guns" but I want my second amendment rights to be protected. 
Guess he changed his mind. 
Based on some of my estimations and statistics from TheGreenPapers, the delegates should increase as follows:

Trump: 621 -&gt; 693

Cruz: 396 -&gt; 416

Kasich: 138 -&gt; 145

------------
- If Missouri holds with a Trump victory (reportedly, there's some absentee ballots out that need to be counted in the next few days), Trump would likely take 42 and Cruz 10. Cruz leads CD4 (5 delegates) by about 400 votes and Trump leads statewide (12 delegates) by 1,700. According to the NYTimes, Cruz is only projected to gain about 200 votes from the remaining outstanding ballots, so 42 to 10 seems to be accurate given the data available.

- Trump should end up taking 53 in Illinois to Cruz's 9, Kasich's 7. 

- 3 delegates are to be distributed in North Carolina, with 1 going to each Trump, Cruz and Kasich.
There it is!
This was my first thought as well.  Merrick Garland's voting record paints him as a man with a rather narrow interpretation of the 2nd amendment and engages in judicial activism.  For those who don't know, Garland believes that only those in the military have the right to bear arms.  He was also in favor of a complete ban of handguns in DC, even in private homes.

They call him a moderate, but they are wrong.  He is an activist judge with an unconstitutional voting record.  I mean, the man is trying to rule that the second amendment was not intended as an individual right, but for the militia only.  Moderate?  Not even close.  

Edit: ok, so someone pointed out that I was reading between the lines when I highlighted Garland's role in the DC vs Heller case.  Perhaps, but I think my assessment was not unreasonable, given that he requested a rehearing of the handgun ban when the judges had already stricken it down as unconstitutional.  I'd say his support of a handgun ban is a pretty reasonable assumption.
&gt; Superdelegates Clinton 467, Sanders 26

WTF ???
Ok so why aren't republicans calling, getting hired and then when the protest starts they just walk away with the sign or do some monkey wrenching  ?
Because they have jobs, and don't have free time in the middle of work hours, as a guess.
Judge Nap is awesome. He's a true constitutionalist. 
There's so little that's true in what you just wrote, you should run for office.
American Democracy in a nutshell. It's ironic the Democrat Party operates this way being as they're supposed to be the purveyors of the democratic process. 

We really need a Trump to win this and throw the left-right status quo paradigm to the wind.
Could you correct him then?
Good. We already know where everyone stands.

 Trump wants to unify the country, protect our borders, and give us back the upper hand on trade. 

Cruz wants to tell everyone he's conservative. 

And Kasichs dad was a mailman. 
No. Feelings&gt;Facts.
Democratic leadership likes lifetime Democrats more, basically.
[There is a huge number of people that disagree](http://i.imgur.com/xKfw21k.png)
Find a fact in there, then.

I'll wait.
No you. You're the one that called it out. Lazy little child.
http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/432716/moderates-are-not-so-moderate-merrick-garland

&gt;He was also in favor of a complete ban of handguns in DC, even in private homes.

That doesn't seem to be true. In that case, he did not support banning of handguns. He recommended that the case be heard by the full panel.
Ah. A debate master has arrived.
Lmao what a bunch of sore losers 
u/wendysNO1wcheese is on your side...i think
Assertion: Extremely narrow interpretation of the 2nd ammendment.

Assertion: Judicial activist.

Assertion: Believes only military should have firearms.

Assertion: Favors DC handgun ban.

Assertion: Not moderate.

Assertion: Votes against the Constitution.

This goes against **everything** that's been said about the guy today.
By calling me a "lazy little child"?

Really? I missed the subtext.
[deleted]
[deleted]
&gt; One issue he dealt with, at least tangentially, has been guns. In 2007, after a D.C. Circuit panel invalidated the District of Columbia's handgun ban, Garland unsuccessfully favored a rehearing by the full court.

I guess if you read between the lines, OP's assertion that he thinks that only the military should have access to firearms makes sense. Right?
http://www.democracyspring.org/

I just don't understand these protests. They set these vague goals and they don't put forth a plan to accomplish them.
Wait you are correct he is not with you. I misunderstood.  And i agree with you in the matter of "feelings trumps facts".  
Haha  see what i did that?
&gt;It’s time to take mass **nonviolent** action on a historic scale to save our democracy.

&gt;thousands will gather to reclaim the US Capitol in a powerful, **peaceful**, and massive sit-in that no one can ignore.

Good luck with that. We all know how peaceful and nonviolent pro-bernie/anti-trump 'protests' turn out.
The guy has voiced an opinion for like 20 years. You want to learn about him read his cases read, read his opinions, don't listen to this shit. He graduated top of his class from Harvard, gave away a high paying career to serve the public. He seems like a great fit to model this current generation. Republican doesn't mean obstructionist. I am republican but a common sense nominee is a guy like this who has great experience on a broad range of issues. Your confusing conservative with republican. Show me some hard evidence to back up any claims. I would love to see what his opinion was for the bases of a ruling you question. This is blatant misinformation and sheeps will up vote this but it's complete shit. 
I literally just saw it and posted it to start a discussion. I 100% think the GOP needs to jump on this while they can. They're gambling with the possibility of a Clinton nominee if they don't take it now, and this is exactly the kind of situation we *need* to have when nominating justices in this country, IMO. I *love* the fact that the GOP and DNC may both be forced to compromise on this issue with someone who actually uses his best judgement and not political ideology to do his job.
[deleted]
Exactly! I mean this in a very general sense just wanted to make sure you know I was not targeting you. I love a good debate and conversation and this is so important for our future. It's not the best decision its not totally Republican or Democrat it's a compromise something I haven't seen in years! Then you have that old man mcconnell who's sole purpose is to do nothing but act as an obstructionist. The whole environment is so agervating sorry for ranting. 
Ahhhh modern intellectualism. It's not about intellect anymore but feelings.  

Editing my comment after reading the article again and watching the video:

I've seen more racism from blacks then from any other race lately.

Do black lies matter?
Rant away, I completely agree with you. I absolutely agree that we need more compromise. I'm so sick of the Mcconnells and Cruzes who do nothing but get in the way of *anything* happening, whether its good for us or not. Let's get a little bipartisanship going.
They don't. 
I think that a well organized protest with a rent-a-mob will get some headway. 

The real plan has got to be to fire up the base. Liberals are just staying home during the primaries, or switching parties. Big protests and civil disobedience gets people excited about their cause. Justice, Equality, Etc.
A few problems here. First, citing Infowars is typically a sign of argumentative desperation but I'll ignore that for now. Second, it's not clear whether or not this video is from students simply sitting around and arguing or from a debate class. If the latter scenario is true, it is standard practice for such students to be asked to step outside their comfort zone. Bring me something more tangible and then I might care.
Oh look, this is what happens when you lower the bar w/ affirmative action

**At first** I was willing to grant the benefit of the doubt.  The reason being, debate teams will take on all kinds of propositions, including those they do not personally agree with.  It's actually pretty standard.

Truthfully (from what little I saw here) I guess that still *could* be what we're watching.  But given the quality and tone of the performance I saw, that's not the vibe I got.  But I'd need to see more, and hear from those involved to get clarification on this either way.

Putting any personal annoyance aside, what little I saw of the "anti-white" side of the argument didn't leave me impressed.  I'm actually surprised this would be the quality of debate going on at an Ivy League school.

**edit:** I also have to wonder - *if* this is just standard "debate team" fare - whether such intellectual daring in debate-topics extends in all directions.  For instance, are there debates on the propriety of *the Emancipation Proclamation*, or the Abolitionist cause in general?  Or would they be open to holding a debate about why *Women's Suffrage* was/was-not a good idea?  Etc., etc.
Well that's like your opinion man.
The great meme war will go down in history as the turning point of American politics.
So.... is this basically a group trying for force Bernie Sanders even though he is not winning this 'Democratic' election? How Democratic of them.
Reading just isn't your thing, is it?

there is ONE Trump, and I want him in office

#\#NEVERHILLARY

is still alive &amp; well!
The head-in-the-sand, gloom-and-doom coming from the far right of the GOP astounds me.  I get that it's all a smear campaign to try and keep Trump from the nomination, but it still boggles my mind.

I fail to see how Trump symbolizes the "death of the GOP".  He's a moderate Republican, sure, with some democrat ties in the past.  [So was Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan#Early_political_career.2C_1948.E2.80.9367), and so were many others.  

If anything, I think what Trump symbolizes is a large and much-needed course correction for the GOP away from the far right.  I don't think many voters who consider themselves Republican identify anymore with the Neocon, war hawk, or Religious Right factions of the GOP.

Is he a conservative purist, politically or socially?  No, but neither are most Americans, nor even most Republican voters.
Seems like nearly all of this is just a matter of disturbing the status quo for politicians and globalists. Curious to get other thoughts on this.
not anti Trump groups

**Soros funded destroyer mobs**

they'd try to impale whoever the **R** candidate 
&gt; grassroots revolted at Rubio’s co-authorship of a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, the Senate “Gang of Eight” bill

above is 98% of the Rubio failure story (2% was the Chris Christie take-down)

They'll be deported then
Trump did win big, and he will in the general election. 

Us Floridians love The Don.
boo 
&gt; warned EIU, a sister company to The Economist  

Well, these people are the ones who declared that producing stuff does not matter but shuffling papers among banks is the way to get wealthy. Tony Blair even told the Germans that all their industry is worth a shit. Germans and Chinese have obviously proving them wrong. So will Trump.
Why is this in r/republicans? This advise is for weak namby pamby hurt little fee fees liberal crowd. 
This would shock a lot of people in the #NeverTrump camp, but I think that would wear off and people would start looking at Trump with fresh eyes and get beyond the media toxification. A Trump /Cruz ticket would be solid and be one that could win in November.
All aboard the Trump train!
Every country which isn't us is realistically an opponent. It shows Putin laughing at Clinton. The ad isn't saying that we want to be rivals with Russia, it's just saying that we need a leader who can be respected by other nations - particularly those who have interests which occasionally rival ours.  
Wanting folks to do things legally is not racism. Grow up. 
I dont think wanting tighter borders is racism. The racism I am referring to is at the trump rallies, some of the protesters are being attacked with racist words.

And my issue here is that I feel like a hypocrit for wanting to fight illegal immigration, because my parents were illegal themselves.
If you're so weak willed that the possibility of Donald Trump becoming president affects your day to day life, then some serious soul searching is in order. I think perhaps that's a sign that you contain weak DNA that does not need to continue in the gene pool and is a liability to the continued survival and success of the human race.
The campaign is not racist and there are always shitheads that do stupid stuff. You can't ever have a perfect base of support.

You're never a hypocrite for doing the right thing. Your parents came her illegally now it's your turn to do the right thing.  
Yeah, sounds right. How should I look at my parents, and their legacy as Americans?
dumbo Cruz has said he won't work with Trump to be his VP

what a butthole thing to say
Since when did Russians become sjws 
&gt;"Nobody should say such things, in my opinion, because to even address or hint to violence is unacceptable," Ryan said, when asked about Trump's prediction of rioting if someone else becomes the nominee.

You know what's just as unacceptable? Openly plotting to undercut your own party's frontrunner and instead nominate someone your donors, and largely your donors alone, would prefer.

There SHOULD be riots if they do what they're planning on. They'd be more justified than any of the riots we've seen in the past few years - and which the GOP talks about far more meekly.

No no we don't want that. The longer Bernie and Hillary duke it out - the better for our nominee, whoever it is (Trump)

If someone missed it it's "save taxpayers some money"
It has to be someone that Trump hasn't destroyed or said anything negative about or else it would be bad press. The nickname 'Lyin' Ted' did not originate from nowhere. 
Where does the constitution say armed forces may only be utilized when a declaration of war is in effect?
I'm sorry; I don't understand what this has to do with life issues. (I'm looking at the fact this article is from LifeSiteNews.) Last I checked, homosexuals tend to have far fewer abortions.
No.
Not necessarily. Trump has kissed and made up with Christie, Carson and others after fierce mudslinging battles earlier on.

Though, he will likely only pick Cruz for VP if he absolutely has to delegate wise ... someone reaching more independent voters makes more sense if he has a free choice.
The economist has been 100% biased against trump from they outset. I think Europeans see a loud man that gets people excited about politics and automatically think we are heading into a world war. I normally like the economist but I find myself laughing at their articles on trump. The guy can only do wrong in their view.
First step is making Trump the emperor, then every thing will fall into place  

but realistically, stop being fucking hypocritical  about hate speech and stop giving into Twitter spam attacks you cuckold administrations 
It will take decades. The pipeline for PhDs into academia pretty much guarantees you will get a lot of SJWs (e.g. those that don't conform don't get their PhD, don't get tenure, etc). It would probably take a century of hard work.
Is that the one that stops by the White House to let President Clinton off?
Ha
[deleted]
are you forgetting that Putin is an authoritarian strongman and people like that don't like criticism? 
and don't forget Russia has an official multicultural policy 
so is it possible that Ted Cruz can  pledge all his delegates to Trump before convention and become his VP. And I am wondering how likely is that or is it even possible because I was under the impression that no one can just order their delegates to ally with another candidates
They cant make the deal legally binding for the delegates I suspect ... but they can still strike it and most likely make it happen
so you can order their delegates to ally with another candidate? but in a subtle and secretive way?
Defund them and let them die. Universities are largely - not entirely, but largely - out of date. We should be promoting alternative ways for people to get an education, with an accent on video-recorded lectures, freely available learning materials, and more.

Pull the plug on public universities altogether, as much as is possible, and give people alternatives to debt and campus life.
Good to know.
The author of this ahem... "article" is delusional. 
Someone needs to explain *"trölol kulture"* to the Kremlin.

We like Putin just fine.  Certainly *more* than we dislike him.
On the first ballot most of them are committed - unless Cruz drops out prior to the convention as part of the deal.

But for a second ballot all delegates are in principle free to vote as they please, thus opening for any sort of deal.

Mind you though, they havent actually written the rules for this convention yet. So speaking with too much certainty about the rules is obviously dubious.
Honestly Putin just needs to be educated on dank memes and fresh bantz.

He'd definitely come around to appreciate it if someone who was nimble enough to navigate the language and culture barrier sat him down and explained it all.
So if Cruz drops out before.convention his people are not bound?
[deleted]
You guys aren't really serious about this, right? I mean...you know this will destroy the county? And you guys seem willing to do it anyway? This is a joke, right?

[deleted]
Indeed. "Starting over" would be easier. It would also be a good opportunity to remedy the cost ineffiency that comes from *both* an outdated approach and decades of bloat.

This is what should be happening in various troubled sectors, not just education. Somewhere between the standard "crab mentality" politics of certain conservatives, and the "whose taxes can we raise?" left is the wise course of **expanding services WHILE lowering costs** that most politicians are either too corrupt or stupid to consider!
Break all of the stereotypes if you are so inclined. The past 8 years has been about them creating stereotypes. Provide affirmative evidence for a way forward.
Just because they have PHD doesn't mean they're right.
PhDs run academia, the majority of whom have never worked outside of academia. Insular, by choice. 

Getting a PhD is primarily an exercise in demonstrating conformity to orthodoxy. It has little to do with intellect, creativity or ambition; anyone can do it, as long as you are willing to conform to expectations, incur a lot of personal debt, and work on projects for which you will receive little/no pay and only ancillary credit. It doesn't merely attract misanthropes, it creates them. (SJWs are misanthropes at heart; it gives them reasons to hate *everyone* of any stripe while feeling self-righteous about it.)
With Trump we would get the chance to do that work. The quality jobs he would bring would be a windfall of wealth to the country.
State legislatures must begin writing laws to ensure freedom of speech on state run campuses for starters. Tennessee has already begun this process. 
We have to realise that universities serve reason first and foremost. What benefit it has for the community flows from this pursuit of reason, not the other way around.
oh fuck. you people are serious. 
Lindsey Graham is always a top contender for biggest slut in Washington

now he's switching from Bush to supporting Cruz.  Cruz is sooooooooo far off Graham's daily diet of D.C. crap, but no matter

what I want to see is if Cruz accepts his endorsement and his fund raising.  that will tell us things we need to know about Cruz...very important things

There's a few inaccuracies in there. Trump actually does well with the college educated voters. He's not just a blue collar candidate, but he does get stronger support from the blue collar people because they've been affected the most by the trade deals and by an out of control immigration system. 
&gt; and people like that don't like criticism?

LOL.  **so what?**?
they get very nasty
that's great news

I've been predicting Trump to **crush** in the Northeast, but **this** is way too cool, **65%** :-)

same will happen in states like NJ, CT and PA

Cruz will be ground into asphalt 
Listen. If you take a step away from all the biased media and do some research yourself, you'll end up with a different impression of the man. That being said, if you understand his actual stance on things and you've done the work to actually be informed then I respect your opinion even if I disagree with it. 
As bad as the GOP establishment trying to force Cruz or worse, even though he is not winning this Democratic election?
so Ryan sounds like any typical censorship crazy Dem or college punk

you can't even talk about what is TOTALLY obvious?

when did that become something Republican?
if you were Cruz, wouldn't you rather Rubio hush for a while longer?
Indeed. Delegates of dropped out candidates are up for grabs as they can no longer vote what they were bound to.
Eugene Robinson the author of this article seems to be upset that the GOP membership is not taking advice from him and other Democrats. The day Republican party officials and bureaucrats stop taking advice from people who are allies of their political rivals is the day the Republican party becomes a powerful force instead of a reactionary party that passes down watered Democrat proposals.
but it still feels unlikely that they will vote for trump
The thing there is to "broker" - make deals with delegations, give the right people the right things.

Apparently the establishment never-Trumps are busy gathering names, phone numbers etc of individual delegates - every single one. So they can do exactly that type of wheeling and dealing before and/or during the convention.

I doubt its an effort Trump can match - it takes micro-management :)
but wouldn't Cruz be electoral poison in the minds of many, besides its been said that he would kill his own mom for the presidency
but it is extremely awkward to run with a man you nicknamed Lyin Ted and that sticks a lot more than what Trump called Christie or Carson
Well he did compare Carson to a pedophile :)
child molester technically but it didn't catch on like lyin ted nor it did stick
Quite vulgar either way :) But youre right it didnt. I still wouldnt have endorsed anyone who had recently said that, however much they said sorry.
Soros and The Establishment are out for Trump blood

I imagine EVERY event will be attacked

btw, with no defense from Cruz who has gone slut hooking up with Lindsey Graham
It is a prediction that is likely if the Clinton Republicans steal the election.
&gt;State legislatures must begin writing laws to ensure freedom of speech

Added a few extra words, there.
there is no GOP in isolation.  GOP, Dems, very little difference.  Both have the same agenda: **POWER** now, power forever ...and ta hell with what the voters/taxpayers want

yes, it's time for The People to take back what is theirs

the party?  ...has become irrelevant in its present manifestation 
&gt; does get stronger support from the blue collar people because...

and because there are a lot more of them

and a lot more people who feel screwed over during the past 10 years
WSJ is major anti Trump, it's sooooo obvious, totally embarrassing at this point
Republicans can best remove social justice warriors at universities by continuing to use the GOP's favorite element: lead.

By defunding the EPA and supporting our best governors like Rick Snyder, the GOP can insure that America's children get their daily supply of lead in their drinking water. The benefits of lead at removing emotional control and causing cognitive decline will steer our young people into our privatized prison system which is the most popular in the world. It will also divert them away from the wasteful college path where contact with analytical thinkers and perhaps even scientists will woo them away from the party. Corporate executives and managers connected to the prison industry are much more likely to donate to the party than academics. More prisons and less graduate students have made America soar while Europe has sunk.

The GOP's reluctance to remove lead from gasoline for decades due to the efforts of Robert A. Kehoe was a bold step that gave rise to the crime spree of the '70s and the triumph of the Reagan Revolution.

A decline in cognitive ability, denial of science, and an increase in the prison-to-university ratio are all best friends of the party. The GOP needs lead.
First time I've wanted to give a troll a gold.
Better that than the loss of our collective soul.

And?
How about take advice from their voters?
It actually seems the other way around.  I bet she mentions his name at least 30 times a day.  And that's not an exaggeration.  
And so far all they've done is energize his supporters.  
The Chicago riots should've taught them their lesson
We're always obsessed with our worst fears.
Of course; it's her job.
Then if she can lead the media with lies then he has the right to defend himself.  So mentioning her names once every other days sounds reasonable.

Do you disagree with what he has said? I don't see anything that fits your description. I know that various Republicans have said things about coalescing about another candidate.
It's hard to believe the GOPe has gotten where it is. It wasn't due to brilliant planning.

They truly believed that Jeb! and Rubio would whip up loyalty among the GOP. They believe George W Bush surely had throngs of loyal fans willing to go to the mat for his brother. And in the 11th hour, when all seemed lost and they needed an act of desperation, they unleashed The Romney.

They're going to float an idea like 'Hey how about McCain again? You guys like McCain better than Trump, right?' next, at this rate.
this is the exact reason we need the first amendment defense act. christians have no recourse if they are forced to do something against their religious beliefs but muslims are not held under the same law.

the article makes a great point that christians were fined for not making cakes for gay couples because of their religious beliefs, yet some muslims dont do their job because of religious beliefs and their EMPLOYER gets fined. its a shitty double standard.
Hero Snowden.

The only blame to go around belongs with the government flagrantly violating the Constitution.
It's these radio talk show hosts that are pushing this crap consistently. Hugh Hewitt, Michael Medved, Mark Levin, Ben Shapiro, back to back to back to back on the radio promoting this anti trump movement but they all want to beat Hillary. It's b.s. talk. 

It's just time these radio talk show hosts get called out. They're looking out for their personal interests instead of America first. 
Lets make a few counter points here. For starters, even if re-shored factories do not bring back factory jobs, they add a benefit to society. They bring back property taxes to local areas who can reinvest that money into communities. These factories also need electricity, and we can not import electricity unless it comes from Canada or Mexico. But even then, most electricity produced for America is generate in America.

Another point is the fact the demand for American goods in China are high. I read a recent report that 60% of Chinese consumers would rather buy American made products. One product that was brought up was baby formula. Since we have higher standards of production, the Chinese trust our baby formula more then their own. So if we can open up that market, we could see a growth in our manufactory production.
Anyone who takes these entertainers as gospel deserve the life and misery they have.  
Jeb! looked much better on paper than he did on the campaign trail, Bush name and all. They should have seen that coming and insisted on Romney or something. They kept calling Jeb! the "smart one". No, he's not the "smart one" and unlike his father and brother he isn't an alpha male. 

I didn't like it when any conservatives chose to not vote for any flawed nominee, the Democrats are always worse for conservatives. The same people who say "Never Trump" had the same attitude in past elections. Looks like they're a bunch of hypocrites! 
This is spot on.  I voted for Trump in my states primary.  This establishment attack on Trump only makes me like him more and reaffirm my thinking that I made the right choice.  

I have rewarded the establishment with my vote the last two general elections and the midterms.  If they try to take Trumps nomination away while he has the most delegates going into the convention, I'll walk from the Republican Party.  

We've rewarded them with majorities in the House and Senate and still they do nothing to stop Obama.  They still kiss the Democratic Party's ass. I'm fed up with it, I didn't vote for them so we could get the Democratic Light Party.  

Trump is surrounding himself with Conservatives, his campaign manager is a Tea Party Conservative.  Sessions is advising Trump and will likely be his top advisor or one of his top advisors.  Carson will be in his Cabinet.  He's making the right moves and he's surrounding himself with the right people.  
This is why Rush still dominates and he's the only one I listen to. He's entertaining and doesn't harp on the same stuff day in and day out

I'm fairly certain that if Trump was running against JFK he would be fanning the flames of anti-Catholic sentiment at the time.
&gt; that targets Ted Cruz just days before state Republicans caucus Tuesday

late?  like **3-4 days** before caucus is late?

obviously not ...and what's the point of saying "late" anyhow?

Yea, Michael Savage is also pretty good. 
When this protester runs for president, I'll make sure to hold him accountable.
I guess they missed the fact Sen. Cruz wants to drastically increase the number of guards, making their job easier: https://www.tedcruz.org/cruz-immigration-plan/
Hewitt talks to his callers like if they're calling in to a church. It's kinda eerie. 
He's just so damn negative and angry
If Sanders gets the nomination, a full court anti-Semitic press is to be expected. Of course, Donnie's apologists will insist he's not a Nazi.
What is wrong with this fool? Anyone thinking this behavior is acceptable from anyone seeking any office of any kind has a much higher threshold to convince me of their integrity.
Yes. You know what's better for them than they do of course. 
I never said I do. I'm saying it's hard to honestly claim *only* Donnie supports them.
Of course he's not the only one, but he's made a lot more legitimate promises that are attainable. Cruz also has ideas, but Trump would do much more. The law enforcement community as a whole supports Trump in the vast majority. 
actually, that might be a legitimate question

the reason being is Romney pulled an Obama

Obama lied right into the camera 23 times about Obamacare.  similarly, Romney has lied into the camera and the American people claiming awful things about Trump which are clearly not true

isn't lying not OK for Mormons?
So, you admit the headline is incorrect?
How do we know if the activists actually are left wing and not, say, hired actors? There's been an awful lot of accusations of such actions going back to the day he announced his candidacy. So, a skeptical eye may be warranted.
He got the endorsement of a newspaper in Israel. So I kinda doubt he's a Nazi, you are a troll though.
You are *seriously* suggesting that Trump is hiring actors to block the road to his rally? 

You /TedCruzForPresident and /NeverTrump people must really be desperate.
I don't like this, this is way too libertarian. 

The new right should include libertarians, but also social conservatives, evangelicals and it should focus on social issues. 
Yeah, as hard as everyone is trying to throw dirt at him, there is now way that's plausible. 
I admit I didn't write it. 
I don't think that political allegiance really matters in a situation like this where someone is trying to cause physical harm to another person . Wrong actions are wrong actions whatever your ideology.
No slacking off!
Potentially misleading headline. The governor said, "This is an interview that I only do about fitness and health, not about politics or my relationships," suggesting his reaction would have been the same no matter which candidate was mentioned.
Fuck Utah! Let Cruz have the bragging rights that he won the Mormon vote. He can make a campaign commercial out of it. Maybe he can get the South Park creators to help him produce it!
Anyone bothered by the fact that Trump is the candidate of the ignorant?

&gt; Trump led by 24 points among whites without college degrees, while Clinton led by 15 among whites with degrees.
I wonder how many thousand Utahans are voting for Cruz because they're offended by Trump's suggestion that Romney is not really a Mormon. Romney is god-like in Utah, the *savior* of the 2002 Olympics, and undoubtedly Kolob-bound.
&gt; Neoconservative pundit Bill Kristol, son of Irving, has been one of the leading forces trying to broker the convention to throw out the will of the people if Donald Trump fails to make it to 1,237 delegates before July. But even if Trump reaches 1,237, Kristol and the gang are considering running a third-party candidate against him to split the vote, **ensure that Hillary Clinton wins**, and keep control of the party that is slipping out of their grasp.

How does that make sense? To keep control of the party, we'll run a third-party candidate to make sure Clinton wins? Doesn't the GOP supporting a third-party candidate *further* reduce the respect for the Republican establishment? Especially if it's goal is to assure Clinton's defeat of Trump?

I'm confused.
Wasn't the 2002 Olympics the one that lead to an investigation of corruption wherein 10 members of the IOC were expelled?  


This seems like chump change. Isn't the Kochs network sitting on a billion dollars earmarked for the Presidential race? Have the Kochs stated their opinion of Trump?
He kind of looks like him and has some of the manorisms
Yeah, the crew that convinced the IOC to award the Olympics to Salt Lake City was accused of bribing IOC officials and some number of those officials had to quit.

That doesn't reflect on Romney because he was brought in later, when the preparations for the Olympics were failing, IIRC.

I'm not a fan of Romney, BTW.
go cry somewhere you fucking phoney

Well it kind of does if that's the reasoning behind said actions. Most civilized humans can talk about their disagreements. Take your platitudes and sit on them.
If we were talking about not sentencing them in the first place for a lot of this shit, I'd be on board. But prisons turn people from petty criminals into skilled criminals.
I also heard the Earth is actually flat. Donald Trump made it that way because he's racist against round things. 
Beck crap should be confined with the other zealots...at /r/conservative

**ONLY** Cruz is pure enough for them
What?
I'm glad I'll be a marine in a few months. These animals need to die. 
It's highly unlikely you'll be shipped off to Iraq any time soon though. We're letting drone strikes do all the killing now. Much cheaper and 'safer' than sending over a few hundred or thousand marines. 
A man can dream. 
Wtf

It's one of the states that if you lose, it's a good indicator you actually are well prepared for the general election.
**PERFECT**

&gt; And the GOP? Those Republicans who assert that a Trump nomination would be a moral stain, a scarlet letter, the death of the party, they are most likely describing what a Trump nomination would mean to their own ideologies and interests.
there are about 329 posts of Cruz and Utah, especially /r/conservative

that's all he's got, Utah.  he can't catch nor even get close to Trump
It is not about the establishment trying to keep control.  It is about them trying to keep the GOP from falling apart because of Trump.  

The establishment is afraid of 2 things.  First, Trump wins and forever brands the GOP with his style of Trumpism/European style fascism.  These politicians know they will have to run against what he has done to the party for the next twenty years.  Second, more than anything, they are afraid of that the #NeverTrump voters will stay home and result in losing Senate/House Seats in this election.

As little as the establishment likes it, they know that around 1/3 of the part is die-hard movement conservatives  (i.e. the Cruz supporters).   Normally, they would have pushed through Bush, Christie, or Rubio that those voters could have held their noses to vote for.  But they greatly miscalculated how angry the base was with the amnesty stunt, the budget deal and with the fact that congressional leadership only puts on show votes and otherwise caves to Obama.

The problem they are now faced with is the fact that upwards of 35% of the party is refusing to vote for Trump.  (The #NeverTrump movement might have been popularized by Romney, but it was already growing in strength before that.)   No need to rehash why those voters won't vote for Trump, but the fact is that a non-insignificant number of them cannot do it - even to stop Hillary.

In fact, a large number of movement conservatives believe that Hillary is the lesser of two evils since the GOP has a chance to be relevant in the future.  Something that cannot happen should Trump win.  They also believe that congress can mitigate Hillary when they would go-along with Trump.

The fact is that if those voters stay home, the GOP loses house seats.  Lose too many and it defeats the congress-will-stop Hillary argument.   

I think that is why you are now seeing the 3rd party rumors. The GOP needs conservative voters to vote for them, even if it is not for the presidency.  (And should it be Trump, that is exactly what I plan on doing - picking the least offensive candidate on the ballot (which will not be DT or HRC) and then straight ticket GOP voting for the rest.)
Mormon checking in to say wtf?
Haha can't stump the Trump baby! 
&gt; ...vie for the state's 58 winner-take-all delegates. **Trump is expected to win**
For me, yes there are many times where I think that Trump goes to far and oversteps bounds, but somebody has to be the "bad" guy. Do I think he should of said it? No. Americans should not be fighting among themselves. Our country is being torn apart by the liberals always calling us racist and bigots, We need a president who is unaffected by that and doesn't care about simple, ignorant insults like that.
It's simple for me: I am and have been anti-establishment for many years.  I don't agree with everything Trump says and I don't need to agree with everything he says to support him as the candidate.  Is he going to hurt some feelings, yes, is he going to avoid saying how he feels even though it may hurt feelings, apparently not.  Most politicians will say anything nice to avoid any negative repercussions, Trump seems to just open his mouth and whatever is coming out is not rehearsed blatant butt kissing for votes.  In my eyes he gives the people a fighting chance against special interests and the political elite that have taken over our country for their own gain. 
there has been much advanced and much covered up about McCain.  he's a long lasting Senator = power, power to suppress.  [stuff like this](http://www.vvof.org/mccain_hides.htm) gets buried
When you read the article of what was said it comes off one way.  When you watch the video it comes off an entirely different way.  His mannerisms and tone portrays someone that has lost complete control of the party.  

One things for certain.  They are expecting to go to a contested/brokered convention (what with that 7th ballot statement) 
When did hundreds become thousands?  When op posted it!
Screw McCain. He is a close friend of Secretary of State Kerry, has been opposing Trump, had picture of him taken with "moderate rebels" in Syria then turned out to be kidnapoers-turned-Jihadists, very disrespectful and deceitful
That's fair enough. Thank you for answering.
Well, that's not a simple insult. He is calling out people who have risked way more than he has.
I'm not a huge fan of McCain myself, but this is way bigger than him. It is about all of the prisoners of war that have risked way more than he ever has.

So what you're saying is we are producedingg a country of Hillary Clinton's at a alarming rate.  Except for these girls gladly do it for free because the queen "B" says she'll pay for it. Thus meaning "US".
Let explain something to you about McCain. I'm an honorably discharged disabled vet from the Navy. So is McCain....unfortunately. 


McCain was held at the "Hanoi Hilton" as a POW and used his daddy who was an admiral at the time to secure his release COMPLETELY IGNORING AND FORGETTING THE REST OF THW POW'S HE LEFT BEHIND. 

This POS is responsible for one of the greatest loss of Navy Sailor lives by friendly fire. Watch the story of the USS Forestall. McCain was a fighter pilot and was on the deck of the carrier fucking around and dropped a bomb on the deck which triggered explosions killing  tons of US Sailors and nearly sank the carrier.

Fuck McCain. All of us old time sailors know he's a piece of shit. 
So, this started back in what August or July of 2015? Trump held a rally in Arizona and talked to the people that showed up. 

Mccain did an interview with someone and that person asked mccain how he felt about Trump holding a rally I'm his state. Mccain went on to slight trump by saying he is "stirring up the crazies" yada yada yada. 

Then, shortly after that, Trump was asked about McCain's comments and Trump said what he said. I don't believe Trump feels that way about all vets at all, and I'm in the military. I believe he said it to piss off mccain and make him look like a fool for being a dick and attacking trump for holding a rally. 
Yeah, I just did my research and he definitely didn't have anything to do with that. He was just among the survivors. And he didn't get his daddy to rescue him. He spent 5 1/2 years as a POW. 
It doesn't matter who it was meant for. He said that he wasn't a hero because he was captured, which is a terrible thing to say to any POW no matter what. I was hoping a fellow vet like yourself would understand. 
McCain is a Neocon puke.

He didn't say McCain isn't a hero, post the whole quote.
Whole quote right here:
"He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”


I understand that sometimes people can get upset and make mistakes. You're talking about a man that helped out a marine that was in Mexican prison for [214 days](http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/donald-trump-quietly-helped-marine-whom-obama-ignored/). Donald Trump said he likes the ones that don't get caught. That's not a slight at us, that is a direct attack at McCain.  

Think of the situation this way. You and a couple of your buddies are hanging out and one of them is not with you guys today. However, earlier in the week he made fun of you to your buddies behind your back about something you did. Now, you guys are hanging out and one of them brings it up to you. You respond with what Trump said because the guy who made fun of you was a POW for a while. Do you really mean what you say or are you partly joking and partly trying to take a cheap shot at him for being a dick to you earlier in the week? That's how I view the situation. I don't think any vet should really be concerned about what he said. 
You left off.... "Perhaps he's a war hero, but right now, he's said bad things about a lot of people,' Trump added."
He said that after he got boo'd. He tends to change his mind a lot. 
Lol. Well you shouldn't be researching on "imright.com"

Read the reports. Even McCain admitted to "daredevil clowning". At least one of his crashed was attributed directly to his error. 
It definitely isn't something to be joking around about. I take POW/MIA very seriously.
Congrats on your decision to join.  That being said though. Combat is awful. It is about the worst thing a person can experience. No one who experiences combat comes home the same. Some are worse off than others, but all of us are changed by it.

There is no glory in going to fight. There is no honor. If you have to go to combat, you will see and do things you never imagined. Those images will stay with you forever. Forever.

I know that I don't have images of marching bands and ticker tape parades. Sure the country loves veterans now, but even then, that love is hollow.

I know you are a super excited boot and taking the step to volunteer is one that very few of us make and I do commend you for it, just don't ever run around your unit talking about how you can't wait to go and kill ISIS.
I do too but we also need to understand context. In addition, we need to be able to joke about things and not take life too seriously sometimes. 
The "riots" comment was in response to the GOP threatening to unfairly take away the nomination and spitting in the face of democracy. I guarantee you that our founding fathers would be the first ones to dust off their guns if they were alive today. I thought this sub was supposed to go away from the blatant bias of the establishment, but it looks like nowhere is safe.
I don't expect it to be a pleasant experience. I'm well aware that it won't be. That being said there's a reason I'm joining. I want to kill the bad guys. I don't think there are very many people in active duty infantry that don't want to kill isis. Do you have experience?
but, you do realize that he *isn't* batman? and this isn't gotham city? and our "enemies" aren't mr. freeze and the joker?

Seriously. Some of these posts are pathetic.
If no nominee has a majority of delegates, there is no nomination to "take away". Even then, the delegate count only informs the GOP who to ***invite*** to be the nominee; the candidate does ***not*** automatically earn it; the candidate is not entitled to it; the GOP is a private organization and as such has no obligation to do anything in regards to any candidate at the convention. You might *want* the party to give him the nomination but it doesn't *have* to give it to him; they have every right to say, "We feel the process broke down; the suggested nominee is too contrary to our perspectives for us to be comfortable and we will nominate someone else." In short everyone has a right to change their mind.

As far as the Founders go, if you want people to take you seriously, it helps to present proof of claims.

As far as this sub is concerned, it is not strictly moderated. So, it sounds to me like you are complaining about other people having different perspectives. In my experience, raising such a complaint makes it less likely others bother listening to anything the complainer has to say.
Damn! And that's from the New York post! One of the most liberal rags there is. 
This bit may have been seen before but it bares (bears?) repeating:

I hope Cruz throws in the towel soon, just so we can see Trump open fire on this woman to the fullest extent.

That is correct, as it always has been.
Bill is losing it. What a weird thing for him to say. 
Lovely, when he does give answers they are either pitiful or lacking in substance. For example, libel laws: if he surrounds himself with smart people why have they not told him suing publications for not issuing corrections/retractions is not permitted under the First Amendment; or if they have, why has he listened to them?

The owners of the Cub: seriously? If he's so brilliant does he honestly think an ad campaign against them will do much?

His penis: he mentions it at a debate and insists *he's* to dignified to discuss it? Puh-lease. If the interview were a courtroom, the judge would easily rule "he opened the door, overruled," to any analogous objection.
When you're asked questions with no substance, it's hard to respond with answers that have substance.
Obama should return the favor of throwing his wife in Gitmo.

And in case Bill thinks that is a reward, the Clintons should be fined 500 million. That should wipe a significant part of their net worth.
You should probably not post your opinions out in public until you formulate them with rational thoughts. 
The only president worse than Clinton was Obama. 
Yeah, no.  Whoever wrote this article is an idiot.  Taking just one example, Washington DC is not responsible for the Flint water crisis; someone in *Michigan* is.
Yes, it's a badge of honor to be seen by so many people as a moron.

The moment redstate told protesters to take guns to shoot off the nazi trump supporters, was the moment I realized redstate should no longer be considered a credible source.
yea, well, that's Obama's plan
&gt; redstate should no longer be considered a credible source

welcome aboard.  Erickson has absolutely cracked up
And criminals who squander classified information should be held accountable.
And this is how you create more votes. 

How does anyone who supports her thinks that this makes any logical or financial sense? 

Seriously....
How does she plan on taxing the ones who don't buy it like with do with citizens? 
Starting to sound libertarian 
Since we know that liberals love to pull the "the first" card, here is a glimpse of your future  

Future Current Year: First illegal immigrant president of the United States
And here I am a legal immigrant that pays taxes and has to pay ~600$ for not being insured... .
Its early for Santa-Claus.  
When Hillary is talking it sounds like she's slowly thinking about which word to say next to not accidentally say something against her overlords lines. You don't get that kind of uncertainty from Trump.
I'm paying 700 a month so I can be insured. Obama are has made my premiums double. And I still have to sit around and worry about where to go when I'm sick. 
Glad to see where my tax money is going. $5000 per month of your an illegal. Go Hillary! /s
 Unless he knew about the attack beforehand, this is nothing more than a stopped clock being right twice a day and if he did know about it that means he did nothing to stop these murders. 
This article is dumb as fuck
It is not about logical or financial sense. Its all about empathy and feelings. 

Feels &gt; Reals is their way of thinking. 

As an image macro beautifully summed it up: 

"12 pictures that will make you forget about laws and borders and shit"
Arab friends of the US will not be amused.
We can make the some Trump 'Keffiyeh's' that they can wear so they don't feel left out. 
And then we'll take away all the guns so the terrorists can't hurt us, right Piers? As if I needed more reason to distance myself from Trump...
most of the original 17 **R** candidates would so *SOMETHING* but without doubt, Trump would kick ass big time

starting with closing the f*cking borders to Muslims

note, it's open borders that got EU into this mess
No.
Yeah, no, on that closing borders thing, Donnie has claimed he never said it: http://m.townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/03/22/trump-on-second-thought-i-never-said-we-should-close-our-borders-n2137979
"Biggest seller" is a relative phrase, like "thinnest kid at fat camp".
Do you even know the difference between wall and borders? 
Jeez, that article is awful.  It's like reading a blog from a freshman at college about how they don't like somebody.  
**daily** the news since June:

TRUMP is winning

everyone else is losing
LOL

"after"?

no, since June, everyday since Trump's June announcement 
Brilliant. Write his campaign manager with the suggestion. The reaction should be interesting.
I think that would need to be handled by a third party. Trump would get way to much shit for that. They would blame him for the next terror attack because he insulted Mohamed. 
In the immortal words of one Jeremy Clarkson, ' Fuck off Piers you Cock'.
I don't listen to self-serving remarks. They're about as useless as a degree from Trump University.
Well, of course he is. He's been shying away from acting against Democratic legislation for years. 
Well he's speaks plainly but it rubs people off the wrong way.  I don't think we'll see a complete int. borders shut down. But, there does need to be a revision of visas. My thoughts are that a major reform here will cause riples that forces reform over there.   
I think we can all agree that THE current problem facing us(US and EU) is uncontrolled immigration. People still on the fence about our own borders are forgetting the fake passports from Syria in South/Central America. Going to need another San Bernardino* to get people to face reality which is sad and another dozen lives lost needlessly.
When did trump ever say take away our gun rights?
Hell he is a firm believe of concealed carry and also carries a gun.
I never said that Trump helf the same beliefs but I am leery of anyone Piers supports.


That being said, this is not my sole reason for the disdain I hold for Trump.
Why do you hate Trump?
Give me one reason other than a sound byte by a MSM
His movement is the equivalent of right-wing "hope and change". He has been unable to equivocate any concrete plan for rectifying the issues our country is facing. 

The only times he has come close, he has advocated for abandoning core american values in favor of racism, xenophobia and unresrticted warfare against an entire subcontinent.

Even if I did like him, he's un-electable. The only voting body he can bring to the polls, aside from those who supported him in primaries, are people who will turn up solely to vote against him becausr of the ignorance and hatered he represents. It seems like very few people will acknowledge that, following this circus, we do have a general election.
WRONG! God damn wrong.
God damn fucking wrong.
He stands for all legal Americans.
Watch Herman Cain's lecture on two retards about Trump:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF6DjwYoi5U
You sound like a berniebot.
Who does Ted Cruz bring to the polls? Wait isn't Donald Trump actually bringing democrats and independents to the primaries? Yes. Is Ted Cruz? No.
Core American Values? Explain which ones.
Donald Trump wants Legal Americans, Donald Trump does not want illegal immigrants.
Can't fault him for trying. But honestly, we need a change of the guard. Too many career Congressmen and Senators that don't work. Mine are a perfect example. Lazy, money grubbers that stay in power because they got there gerrymandering and stay because they can out spend on marketing to an uneducated base. 
I wouldn't want that jinx  

Edit: The jinx strikes: 24 hours later, Cruz sex scandal
Paul Ryan is part of the reason for the state of the GOP and American politics. He doesn't care about the tone. He cares about people complaining too much that their representatives aren't, you know - representing them. "Gosh fellows, can't you all just trust us and approve of what we do?"
This is pathetic 
I'm already a registered member of the model republicans, but I unsubbed because I was getting a lot of spam from a lot of shit bills and amendments, have those gotten any better?

Will do, and thank you for introducing me to an awesome subreddit.
Good point. I take it he did not see the yarmulka as a red flag to the islamic bull?
Who cares if it was a red flag, we need to stop being politically correct with these people. 

Trump should try and get the Israeli pilots who fly the next bombing mission against a Muslim state to wear these during their mission. 
Good lord that article was one giant diatribe.
From the Republicans or the others?
You do you, I'll do me. We'll both have a nice day.
I hope there's enough room. 
TLDR....

* Trump is looking out for your safety.
* Hillary is a crazy bitch.
* Obama just does not give a flying fuck.
that seems right for state winners
Kasich says he might want a Dem VP for his ticket

http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/kasich-rules-out-vice-president-role-is-open-to-dem-running-mate/article/2586662
Hillary is a conservative compared to Kasich. The only person left in the race that is more Liberal than Kasich is Sanders and he is a Socialist!
the "case" goers like this:

the TOP TWO most popular = the Ticket

nothing else matters.  the people prefer Trump+Cruz (thank goodness)
have you seen any of the (hilarious/sad) videos of cameras going on campus and asking stuff like:

1. name the Vice President
2. who is this man? (picture of someone like Biden)
3. what is the Separation of Powers?
4. what are the three branches of government?

on and on, very few, **VERY** few right answers

so, what value can we place on their opinions? (college kids)
Mostly others.
It is kind of hit and miss most days. The socialists are pretty much dead now so most bills written are by the Libertarians, the Dems, or us. 
Oh cool! Who killed the socialists?
The socialists themselves. Their leadership kept cheating so basically all the edgy socialists split off to form a more irrelevant communist party. The rest are kind of incompetent and bad at doing well....anything.
Haha! Serves them right! Sure I'll come back. Are any positions in the party open?
We're going to have elections in April if you want me to PM you then. Otherwise we got a couple of state cabinet positions open right now. 
Whatever works, I just figure if I'm going to be coming back I should probably get something to do.
Just a diplomatic niceity, nothing 'politically correct'.
Once again, the senator is correct.
I've always been a big fan of Newt. I agree completely with him about Trump.
Why is he talking about himself? In that case, I agree.
Cruz will be glad to embrace Islam again when Saudi money matches his Goldman Sachs fund.
Thanks for the hilarious image of Paul Ryan waking up to the sound of screaming and finding a Trump rally in his back yard. 
Great job!  Like with Trump, the establishment needs to remember it's the people who they serve, not the other way around.  
Donald Trump is slowly strangling Cruz to death publicly. The man has no hope but its getting Trump an insane amount of free press. If this sex scandal is true then the press has a legitimate excuse to not cover him if Cruz drops out and it will be Hillary/Bernie show 24/7. Cruz will not win and letting this play out is in the long term really good for someone like Trump. It keeps him relevant every time he wins.

Using ISIL only confirms their legitimacy. Use IS or ISIS instead. 
I'm a Trump man all the way

but it would be a history making shocker to see the establishment roll out a person who has not been a candidate as their proposed nominee...then jam him down our throats

what will America do?
So, the "8 things" boil down to rumor, gossip, speculation, and accusations by publications viewed by many Americans as tabloids; not very compelling.

being conservative and being a Republican passed by long ago

it's a myth anymore because both parties have blended into a mass to gain and keep federal power (and MONEY) to themselves

sure, one party is in, another takes over, but the insiders are always  the same

like Kasich is in the race to screw up Cruz, the only conservative.  it's a little job his establishment friends gave him

no one is going to win running just because he/she is a conservative.  and conservatives are killing themselves because of their DEMANDS for "purity".  it's all so stupid and self destructive
I don't quite believe Cruz is a conservative. He says he is, but what has he done? He's supported a lot of things that no right minded conservative would support.

He may be socially conservative, but he openly supports the NSA and other such agencies. Abortion isn't really the biggest thing that comes to mind when I look at a candidate's record. The patriot act, etc... All things that actual conservatives would oppose.
Islam is their best chance at wiping out Christianity
You might wanna point that out In the video, you may have, I didn't watch the whole thing, but you could get some annoying sjw people on your ass about it
&gt;I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won’t go.
These smears are completely false, they’re offensive to Heidi and me, they’re offensive to our daughters, and they’re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack.

We should all pay close attention that the closest Ted comes to denying the affairs is to say that "these **smears** are completely false," before pivoting to how offended he is. It certainly would have been a whole lot more "crystal clear" if Ted had just come out and said something closer to "these *allegations* are completely false" or better yet "I never had an extramarital affair." 

When you're dealing with a lawyer as good as Cruz, these distinctions are significant.
yep. And he finds room to blame them on trump, call them lies (instead of a mistake), etc.

Very suspicious
I was banned for using the word cuck lol
There's always a second Air-Force One brought along with the first one to serve as an emergency backup. 
Well yeah, the front gunner in the party's primary is someone that is not bound to play by their rules and rely on them for money and fundraising and it scares the shit out of them. Someone can run in their party and not be controlled by them scares them a lot. 
&gt;The National Enquirer Was Right About John Edwards, Tiger Woods and Jesse Jackson

But about how many where they wrong in between? That is a terrible argument. If I say every celebrity had an affair then I would have quiet a good track record as well, if I forget about all the once I was wrong about.
I am not saying Cruz had or didn't have an affair I am just saying that this argument is very weak.

Don't forget that they have tremendous trouble criticizing anyone who is not white, and while Islam is not a race, they treat it as the proxy for one.

[Horseshoe Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory)

tl;dr The extreme left approaches the extreme right and both are terrible. 
Can't TRUSTED.
The guy that wrote the original article won a Pulitzer Prize.  That doesn't sound very weak to me. 
Submission Statement: This is a medium length article that parallels the popular impact in political thought of a book by four academics "The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform" in 2008 with the rise of more academic and quantitative political journalists such as Nate Silver and Ezra Klein.

While the book and its adherent journalists made a statistical case that a unified party establishment controls the post 1970's reformed primary process to deny any chance of a Donald Trump (or Bernie Sanders) frontrunning, a huge stumble was made in part due to the observer effect.  Party elites thought that a successful primary insurgency could not happen due to the book but forgot that the book stressed the need for a unified party elite for this to happen.

It also gives some parting thoughts to the need for more data and academics in political reporting but stressed the impact it can have on politics and voters if there is hubris.
Are you talking about J. R. Taylor? He/ She wrote the National Enquirer article. I could not find anything about that Author winning a Pulitzer Prize in any category.

He's that good
At least use the given title of the video, "First Lady Fiasco: Cruz's **side** hit first (03/08/16)". Don't editorialize it by removing a key word. It still holds weight.
It was changed afterwards.

I apologize.
Gotcha. Good to know.

Trump has more female executives running his businesses then any other man of his stature. How do you argue against that?
I don't know, but I got some time to spend:
1. [Barack Obama with Caroline Kennedy - 05/15/2014](http://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/enquirer-exclusive-barack-obama-caroline-kennedy-cheating-scandal/)

PRESIDENT Barack Obama is caught up in a bombshell cheating scandal with high-powered politico Caroline Kennedy – and first lady Michelle Obama is furious!

It was either covered up well or wrong.

2. [Sean Penn cheating scandal? - 12/03/2014](http://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/exclusive-sean-penn-cheating-scandal/) They broke up in June, 2015, but no indication that cheating played a roll.



3. [Brad and Angelina - 12/02/2015](http://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-cheating/) It's only been 3 Month since but the fact that other tabloids said that it was a made up story and that nothing has happened since makes me believe its wrong.

So there we go 3 Stories that they where wrong on.

This one was to great not to share and it shows how terrible tabloids mislead in their titles:
[Exclusive Interview Mitt Romney Love Triangle Shocker! - 2/14/2012 (Election Year)](http://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/exclusive-interview-mitt-romney-love-triangle-shocker/) TLDR: His College Girlfriend left him while he was missionary in France - 1966.

Good to know, thanks for the information.
doesn't matter.  they won't talk and the EU is too PC to do anything but ask "pretty please"
No he didn't. He even stated as much on his Twitter account. He quoted an article. Then another paper quoted his quote and attributed it to him. 
Snowden, still relevant ... Yeah draw your own conclusions.
You pretty much are sounding like an asshole. Step away from this thread for a moment, have a beer, then come back and read.

It's so much easier to understand how Trumpites swallow all of donald's lies when they admit to reading tabloids.
How the hell do I sound like an asshole? If they can't explain their logic, then they shouldn't have that opinion.
And these women probably are all either attractive or sleeping with him or only there because he wants to maintain his non-misogynistic image
I hope people don't rely on you to make judgement calls.

There's no logic here. When it's just a bashing, all that can be done is to bash back.
There IS logic. This is on a feminist, REPULICAN site.
I hope people don't rely on you for facts
He thinks they are laughing with him
Dispute my facts or do the usual SJW play and cut and run when it's facts time. 
Yeah, feminists are highly logical people.

I'm an avid 2nd amendment supporter, but the fact of the matter is that open carrying at high profile events like this is generally bad for the cause.

[10 years ago this girl infiltrated the Islamic groups in Brussels](http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/03/25/10-years-ago-this-undercover-reporter-warned-of-radicalization-in-molenbeek/)

They weren't hiding anything, anyone could walk in and listen.  Note the preacher who is one of the 'moderates' the US has been arming in Syria. 
Seeing as the rich pay all the taxes, any tax cut benefits them.  
If you are repeating liberal talking points you'll be banned as a troll and Bernie bot.  You can message the mods to undo the ban if you aren't a Bernie supporter. If you are note the sidebar which says no Bernie supporters. 
The interesting thing as well is the fact that when we lower taxes, at least to the levels that Coolidge lowered them, the tax revenue goes up.

It happened under Coolidge, Reagan, and Bush.  Only difference is that Coolidge wasn't in the middle of a war, had a congress that worked with him, and they managed to cut spending.  That, coupled with more tax revenue, led to a surplus and a very free economy.
The Left wants complete control of the government.  The ONLY organized resistance to PC and the liberals has come from Christianity.  Islam is the enemy of my enemy and is being used as a lever against Christianity in the US.  I don't know why Europe is importing them all. 

**Christians had strong control of the military**.  Through Obama's term they've been throwing out top officers to replace them with non religious liberals.  Then you start to see the 'sensitivity' and 'white privilege' training start up.  

The air force is the most Christian of the branches.  [Here is a salon article on one of the fights liberals and Christians are having](http://www.salon.com/2014/09/17/air_forces_mind_boggling_violation_members_forced_to_swear_religious_allegiance/).

**Christians oppose the Left's control of education.**  For example without Christians the Left would completely control textbook publishing in the US.  Sure I think teaching creationism is stupid, but without organized opposition PC would have steamrolled the US much earlier.  
 

I'm voting for Trump because he is more conservative than the rest.  Trump is going to eliminate ISIS and withdraw our military.  Once that has happened there is no longer an excuse for the surveillance state and Trump would end it.  

Trump is the only candidate who will actually prevent amnesty.  This destroys the conservative voice in America and cannot be allowed to happen.  

Trump's tax plan cuts taxes by quite a bit and eliminates income taxes on 75 million households.  This is a genius move as it now gives conservatives the upper hand on the spending debate.  No dem has ever proposed actually helping the poor that much. 

Trump has the ability to lead the Republican party back to its conservative base as evidenced by the votes he is getting.  The only issue is religion and religion does not equal conservative, but they will fall in line with Trump because the democrats will continue to gut Christianity and Trump has vowed to protect it.

I'm very pro-2A but this is going to far, only makes us look bad.
Some quotes from the article for discussion.

&gt; Trump is not a real Republican

He has voted Republican for 40 years straight and due to his business fame we have him on video espousing Republican values since the 80s. 

&gt; does not believe in Republican values

Here is a list of Republican values:

**Smaller, localized government.**  Trump is the first to talk about common core.  Trump's tax plan is the best of the candidates.  Trump is the most pro state's rights of the candidates.  

**Individual Liberty.** Trump is the strongest second amendment supporter of the candidates.  Trump is the only one planning to end the wars and scale back our influence which will allow us to end the surveillance state.

**Free Enterprise.**  Trump is advocating quite a bit more cuts in regulations than anyone except for Cruz.  I'd love to see the Republicans adopt Cruz's stance.

**God**.  Trump has said he will defend Christianity against the Left's attacks.  He is the only Republican successfully fighting against PC.

&gt; is for the most part an immoral, dishonest, vain, narcissist who would endanger this country. 

I'm open to anyone explaining this one.

&gt;The GOP gets killed if he's the nominee. 

I've not heard this one before?  How does the GOP get killed by a guy that is bringing out so many more voters?


Why would they pick that Trump clip?  Trump replied that he would never go nuclear because once someone hits you you have to hit back and raising the stakes therefore is stupid because nuclear would now be on the table.

It didn't set them up at all for the bashing they wanted to do.  Just made them seem stupid for not understanding English. 

Would you like to make an actual argument?  You can't ban people here. 
They banned a lot of Trump supporters with a script. I hadn't even posted there and got hit because of my posts in The_Donald.  The sub had a lot of Trump support right before the bannings started at the end of 2015 then nothing. 

Prior to the bannings the mods had been pushing Cruz by constantly spamming the sub. And not with content either just links to the Cruz subs.   Its not about conservatism, they are just Cruz supporters. 
Because Trump went Totally off topic and brought up Bush. He rarely answers a direct question.
Is Cruz actually a conservative?
Except America.

Where it counts.
Our foreign policy is far more important. Trump knows little about America.

I haven't heard what the other candidates propose here. Anyone know?  I've only heard Trump talking about creating safe zones.
Trump supporters have the same amount of logic, denying that he said something when it was heard-and seen- on national television. LIVE.

And he is even possibly a RAPIST.
Please, he's not that informed.
We don't deny facts, we just don't jump to the same illogical conclusions. Everything is not racism and everything is not misogyny.

Donald Trump doesn't take shit, and he doesn't care if you're a man, a woman, white, black, hispanic, etc. Just because some conservatives are too afraid of being hit with identity politics doesn't mean we have to keep indulging this bullshit.

It's not that hard to win this battle. It's easy. Just raise your middle finger and tell them to go fuck themself.
All I know is it takes about a year and a half to two years for refugees to get full clearance to enter the U.S., making entry by means of being a refugee an exceptionally inefficient and ineffective method of doing so.
Illogical conclusions? He is misogynistic and a possible rapist.

Plus, it's also been shown that Trump would lose to even Sanders.

Obama is not affiliated with the Republican Party.
I can't think of any reason why anyone would put it past a terrorist organization to start laying the groundwork for an operation two years in advance.
It's like I'm talking to a wall.

Forget it.
I have trouble believing that anyone would willingly give up power, so I am naturally skeptical when it comes to that sort of thing. 

Quite frankly, Trump's tax plan doesn't look that bad. It's a lot better than what I was expecting him to come out with. I'd even go as far as saying that it actually looks pretty solid.

As for ISIS, I'm of the belief that destroying them should not be America's duty. I also do not believe that America should function as the world's police force. I would rather we help organize a coalition of middle eastern countries and help them coordinate attacks against ISIS, because it should be their responsibility to maintain stability in their region, not ours. The cold war is over, we are no longer interested in maintaining puppet states simply because they oppose the soviets and the chinese. Let them figure themselves out, while we gently guide them.

Also, as far as I am concerned and as far as any of you should be concerned, this isn't about beating the dems. Beating your opponent is the natural consequence of making a good decision. We should be more focused on coming up with the best possible policies that will serve the American people in the best possible way.

As for amnesty and illegal immigration, I am not quite sure why it is such a big deal to many of you folks. If people truly want to get in, making it harder won't deter them. The deterrent has to be in my opinion a better means of legal immigration. Now, before you get outraged, let me explain this in depth.

Legal immigration allows for us to thoroughly vet the people coming in through our borders. This greatly reduces the risk of us allowing dangerous individuals to enter our country, and will filter them into a different form of illegal. This allows for us to create a specialized taskforce to deal with a very specific problem, instead of what we have now. The majority of illegals in that case would actually be people who we do not approve of, and there would be absolutely no sympathy for them. Trump's ancestors are immigrants, as are many of ours. The thing we should be looking to do is not to make immigration impossible, but funnel funds into our border security instead of our massive army. The military hegemony is no longer necessary, and controlling who comes into our country is more important. 

As far as religion is concerned, I hope that you understand the value that our founding father's put on the separation of church and state and why it is important to maintain a government in a world in constant change.
Ah, the wall. Tell me more about this WALL. Is it the same wall that Trump plans to build?

What is your point, Mr. Blatantly-ignores-facts?
Because its easier to have people get a visa. A lot easier.
It's basically this. If I call you, for example, an asshole.

It's a fact that I called you it. Now, if you're a woman, that doesn't make me a misogynist. If you're black, it doesn't make me racist. If you're in a wheelchair, doesn't mean I hate the disabled.

That's the point. You're playing identity politics. It's liberal bullshit. It doesn't matter what the hell any Republican says or does, they're going to try to paint us with all of that shit anyway, so have some balls, fight back. Quit being a Democrat.

You don't respond to my point.

But in any event, no. Not always.

Because you don't provide any specificity to your claim, it's tough to tell you exactly what you've failed to consider. But let me take a shot in the dark: your assertion stands correct only if you're talking about someone who hasn't disappeared for months in a terrorist country with a thorough academic record and a credible source for money. 

A lot of would-be terrorists definitely don't fall into that camp.
A lot of would-be terrorists don't fall under that definition, sure. But more qualify for a visa than as a refugee. The 9/11 hijackers were all visa holders and as far as I know there hasn't been an attack by any US refugee.
Obama never backs off.  Obama always wins.  Republicans never stop him, NEVER
That's because the Republican party is anti-LGBT Democrats
This event just goes to show you how unreasonable the left has become. Stand your ground. This is about standing up for sanity and standing up for your wives, daughters, and sisters. 
I'll accept for the sake of argument your assertion, that less would-be terrorists are eligible for entry into the United States as refugees than are eligible for *all other classes of visas available.*

Besides a pithy observation, what do you think that signifies in the context of this discussion? That you shouldn't pay attention to one potential problem because another potential problem is bigger? Seems pretty irresponsible to me. And for that matter so does the entire get shot first ask questions later approach to national security you seem to espouse.

Moreover, pointing to a flawed visa regime that has been overhauled beyond the point of recognition in an attempt to address its flaws seems to be a precarious foundation for a policy argument of non-proactivity.

And still nothing you've said provides any support to believe that a terrorist organization would not use the refugee process to attack the US.
She gets my vote..
The reason they wouldn't use the refugee process is because there are other more effective methods. Can the refugee process be exploited? Absolutely. I'm sure you could slip someone in through it. However there is no need. There is already a more effective method of entering the country. Why would any terrorist organization purposely make things harder for themselves?
How readily you throw around this thought that a refugee entry is ridiculously slower and/or harder than getting a visa kind of makes me wonder if you actually know anything about the visa process. For example, I can tell you from personal knowledge that people with green passports often enough wait a year for a fiance visa, and the interview process isn't all that different from those to obtain refugee status.

But regardless, I thought we'd already gotten on the same page that there are some instances where an individual may not be eligible for a student/etc visa. The part you're missing is that all would-be terrorists are not fungible suicide-vest wearers. Some are highly specialized and/or skilled, but just perhaps not eligible for a student visa. In those cases, using a refugee visa wouldn't "purposely making things harder," it would be the only option.
It may be we are also talking about different things. I'm more focused upon organized terrorism which would select and train people which were capable of obtaining a visa.
Nah. We're talking about the same thing. You're just getting further and further away from reality so it seems like we may be talking about different things.
The only time I'd vote for Hillary

One word: "So?"
So how stupid is he to think his past wouldn't be brought up?
Who cares as long as he doesn't deny it?

When Arnold was running to Gov of California, a reporter asked him if he would admit that he had been in sex orgies. His response was (paraphrasing) "of course I was. I was voted the sexiest man in the world for 10 years straight. Of course I was having orgies". 

No one brought it up ever again.  Just don't lie and act like it never happened. 
He's not saying he didn't think his past would be brought up. He's saying that at the time he was talking without thinking 'I'm gonna run for president, I better really watch what I say'. His response seems proper: 'Yeah I said that, big deal. I'll watch my words as president', basically.
Trump would/will massacre Hillbag.  it will be over by 8:30 PM
Most polls I've seen feature the opposite. Most polls also feature large portions of voters, such as republican women "never thinking of voting for Trump". I don't see how he would "destroy" her when everything so far has said otherwise.
And he will. We will see in November. 
what's missing in the polls is reality.  people can't yet picture the matchup, e.g. seems that 90% of conservatives are dripping blood from their mouths to promote Cruz by defeating Trump.  with no Cruz, where do they go?

further, there is **soooooooo much dirt** about Hillbag, her times in office, her private money scamming etc....on and on.  Trump will take advantage and crush 
Delusional 
you'll see
Of course he has the fact he hasn't committed treason going for him. Hillbag has a lot of money though so we would have to work for it.
It might have something to do with the idea it's none of our business.
Technically, she hasn't committed treason either, even if she's guilty in the server case.
Yeah, no. Check the state by state polls.

The First Amendment and the Second Amendment are horrible, horrible things. Shut them up and take their guns! 
If there's one thing that Republicans are good at it's staying out of people's private sex lives. 
I can't understand either side of this.  It's ridiculous for someone to go "[poof](http://peripateticbone.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/best-dressed-guy.jpg), I'm a woman", and walk into a women's restroom.  But then under this law [this](http://transvalid.org/wp-content/uploads/shawn1.png) person should be arrested for using a men's restroom?  Honestly, if people like that did civil disobedience this issue would be over nationwide because of the ridicule.

These polls are useless before we've seen them go head to head. Clinton has had the full support of the Dem establishment and has been going up against a boy scout who refuses to go negative on her, Trump on the other hand has had to contend with what can only be called the GOP going nuclear on him. What's going to happen to Hillary when she goes up against someone who is actually willing to attack her, and attack her in ways no other politician would ever dream of?
Welp, there's a few million more votes for Trump.
There's a reason why a man that will sue anyone and everyone at the drop of a hat hasn't bothered to sue over this. 
I think all of us here love the second amendment but it does not cover shooting an unarmed politician who you don't like to death.
GTFO. Go get your own, throw that MAGA hat on and show those boys who the boss is.

I've learned to not listen to unsourced statements; too often they turn out to be phony.
"It's really sad that we're getting this kind of thing at the end of the campaign."

His tone and word choice makes it look like he's less mad about being caught than he is about it being once Jeb and Rubio dropped out. Really bad timing for eGOP shills to have to rely on Kasich to soak up some delegates.

Kasich really doesn't want to go to war with Trump...



Interestingly, the first Amendment might actually protect this (but probably not)

He won't sue because he know's he's guilty and he's afraid they're going to drop the proof on him.

I don't know.  She's currently under fire for refusing any more debates with Sanders because of his "negative tone".

Trump would shred her in debates.
It's from brietbart, you know..... the site the reporter who touched/got grabbed worked. 
It's like I said, a bunch of low energy loser cucks wrote a constitution that allows this kind of thuggish black behavior. Very disturbing!
Words are difficult to read when they are randomly typed. Very confusing! 
Never thought about that. I guess it is true If she can't handle Sanders, she wouldn't be able to handle Cruz, and would get shredded by Trump.

Good, I'm glad that we are finally getting a candidate that will stand up for what's right. The Republicans threw a FIT so that Trump would sign an agreement that he wouldn't run as a third party candidate if he didn't get the nod. Well, now that he's looking like he's going to win, why isn't the Republican establishment backing Trump?
Good. Trump is awful.

They don't care. 
The GOP and the #NeverTrump idiots are basically endorsing Hillary at this point, and aren't fooling anyone.  If neoconservatism, trillions spent, and thousands of American lives lost because Israel &amp; Globalism is more important than your own damn country, then by all means, it's your right to vote away our sovereignty.  Just don't be surprised when the patriots get pissed off.
They truly are. 

I've had several people over on /r/conservative argue with me that they'd rather see Hilary elected than Trump because they would rather lose than have Trump destroy the conservatives agenda. 

They have no idea what they would be doing to the Supreme Court if they elect Hilary but their selfishness has blinded them. 
 
I'm proud to say I was there and I boo'ed. He has disappointed me so much. I looked up to him when I was growing up. 
Pretty sure he knew his past would be brought up. What makes you think he's surprised by this?
This struck me as interesting when listening to Rush this morning...I instinctually took this as something to read into but so far i dont know what to make of it...
Was gonna post this at r/the_donald but i wasnt sure it better fit here...though there is less traction here. Curious what people think though.
I support Donald Trump. 
Baffled. Besides Trump, who do his supporters like?
Jeff Sessions.
May actually be a couple of splits for the general depending on how things go.  Last night's republican debates had candidates easing up on their written pledges to support the GOP candidate regardless of who gets the nomination.  If it is somehow taken from Trump in a contested convention there are many who could see him running as a third party candidate.

Sanders similarly promised he wouldn't run as a third party candidate, but his supporters, much like Trump's, are very discontent with the status quo of politics. And he has the money and support to keep his campaign going for quite some time. Sanders was traditionally an independent too.

Would be crazy to have a four person race where all the candidates have big name recognition.  Post convention party unification could play a big role in deciding which party controls the white house next year.

If the #NeverTrumps split or force Trump to split, republicans will be handing the general to the dems if the dems remain united.  But if Sanders flips an angry bird to the establishment and the republicans come together well, liberals will be split themselves.

Even if we don't get a third party candidate running, there could still be a lot of people who say "fuck it" to this election.
Are all GOP candidates required to sign an agreement to not make a third party run? The document signed by Trump seemed like a standard form.
Ur mom
Cries of fascism seem like driving.

I draw the line at exactly the right spot and everyone who disagrees is evil or stupid.
Well. At least everyone's happy about this news.
He's surprised by everything. It's his huge ego.
So no reason. You're just pretending that he didn't expect it, then mocking him for not expecting it.

The MSM thrives on people like you. 
Also there's a video showing exactly this that you can just, y'know, watch.


there's oh so much to do
headline is wrong

they have decided the won't AUTOMATICALLY support the winner
As a hardcore Trump man I have to admit Trump's stance on torture is the only thing I fundamentally disagree with him on. 

The way I see it we are the good guys therefor there are certain lines we shouldn't cross.

He still is miles above the rest though and got my vote by A LOT.
Because they won't support someone appointed as the result of a brokered convention. I agree with them. 
If Trump goes third party he will have my support even if it means Hillary wins.
NY forking Times ...geez
How can we win if they are playing by a different set of rules? 
Upvote for Trump!

Why can't liberals get it through their heads that some people view abortion as murder?

&gt;and laws to deport undocumented immigrants actually allow racial profiling against all Latinos, it’s pretty hard to argue the distinction.

Okay. I dunno if that's true, but let's assume it is.

That sucks.   

But it's not a good enough reason to simply ignore the illegal immigration problem.

How votes for Cruz might not translate into delegates..

Rand Paul is proving to be smarter than his father. 
You shouldn't be downvoted because its true. The biggest reason Rand is so much more successful than Ron is because he is willing to play in the sandbox with the establishment. Ron just took his toys and went home. 
Jeb could EASILY be the nominee

if they f**k over Trump and Cruz, Jeb will volunteer
I'll be amazed
[deleted]
I'd be hesitant to call Rand more successful than his dad at this point. Rand plays with the GOP, and he's a young Senator that has failed to run for President. Ron didn't play with the GOP, and he was like a ten-term Congressman that wrote books, started a movement, and brought attention to the Federal Reserve.

Maybe in 20 years, but not today. 
They don't like him because he knows words, he knows the best words. The man is a buffoon on TV, his maturity level alone makes him unfit. "The Geneva convention is the problem". Words from a man who has a good understanding of global politics.

Not denying that.
A quick web search show Sen. Warren does not claim to be an Indian. Al Gore never claimed to be a scientist. While you might not like what Al Sharpton, it doesn't make him not a reverend. While you might not like what George Stephanopoulos reports, it doesn't make him not a journalist. Until Hillary divorces him (or G-d forbid dies), Bill is still a husband. And there is nothing unpresidential about showing respect to other world leaders.
&gt; “When we see discrimination and injustice, we have to act.  This law is not just wrong, it poses a public safety risk to Connecticut residents traveling through North Carolina,” said Malloy said.

&gt;HB 2 was enacted last week, and it requires people to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity

So anyone know what the public safety risk is?
That is funny because they've always been in DC buying off politicians which is why so many people are voting for Trump. 
Those running against Trump are throwing all of their conservative principles out the window in their desperation.  The party to have any kind of negotiating position with Trump in the convention is going to have to find someone else to nominate.  

But they threw Romney and Paul Ryan away with their anti Trump shitting on the voters.  Who else do they have? 

Trump is going to walk into the convention and completely own the party - they have no alternative now. 
The delegates will do what the party tells them to do.  And the party has no alternative but to do what Trump tells them at this point.
If Trump goes 3rd party most of the Republican voters go with him. No one would be stupid enough to throw away all those supreme court nominations.  

The dems are going to require unions and force you to pay dues. 

Nationalized health care and other industries. 

The democrats want pedophiles to be able to use the women's bathroom.  If the dems get a nomination all the 'anti-LGBT' you must use the bathroom of your gender gets thrown out. 

&gt; That sucks.

Why does that suck?

What I mean is you can't even 'assume its true'.  'racial profiling against all latinos' doesn't even make sense to me - what is it supposed to mean?
Because it is murder.  'Choosing' a few months of your life over another human's life is insane.  The culture that would encourage a woman to just have an abortion is very sick.  

But it doesn't matter.  Male contraceptives will be easy to use and eliminate the problem.  Well if we were a theocracy I'm sure they'd ban contraceptives too, but that isn't in the cards. 

Yep you can't win a war if you are being a pussy.  That is Trump's message.  Once the war is over there won't be any 'certain lines being crossed' on either side.  So the sooner we get Trump in there to clean up the better off the world is.
They are trying to get the upper hand in a negotiation with Trump they do care and they do know Trump is the nominee at this point.  Its all about how much they can get him to give up on. 
So how many people are supposedly having their rights violated?

How many pedophiles would take advantage of being able to hang out in the women's bathroom?
Sorry, I don't pay any attention to the media. i can think for myself.

According to Governor Malloy the fact that men won't be able to use the women's room is a public safety risk. 
Damn, who plays harder, Cruz or Kasich? 
The great part of this country is everyone is afforded rights regardless of there religious beliefs. There no rule saying Roman Catholicism is the religion of the Republican Party. I am a straight man but this is just a half assed attempt to argue that men who like men or women who like women shouldn't be afforded the same rights as you and I. That's some real bullshit.
Keeping men out of women's restrooms when they have no good reason to be there isn't adopting an official religion. The modern American far-left is bat shit crazy and this trans gendered stuff is just one example why. 
&gt; The candidates are on more political extremes.

The only extreme is Sanders.  Most of the 'excitement' is simply the rioting by Sanders supporters.  He could denounce BLM tomorrow and end the violence.

As for Trump - 

Congress already voted to build a wall - Obama is simply not doing the job of the executive and building it.  All Republicans want tax cuts, spending cuts and jobs which is all Trump talks about.

&gt; “If people had been challenging Trump from the start, I think that would have helped put a cap on him,” Miller said.

Yeah no one was attacking Trump at the start at all buddy.  
I'll ask you one question do you actually no anyone that's transgender. I am completely straight but I even wonder if someone with your attitude has actually interacted or even asked them about a question like this rather than being dismissive and calling it a far left crazy because that's just a cope out. It's much easier to blame it on. A direction than to confront the actual issues at hand. 
&gt; accused the Trump campaign of speaking “dismissively” of one of their "female members.”

Wow SJWs in the Republican party **SHOCK**

&gt; Added Haynes, "We've been in contact with individuals in law enforcement here in Tennessee.”

Oh yeah we need the cops because Trump's people are going to show up and vote against our plan to steal the delegates.

&gt; Leatherwood said the party was pressing forward. "The TNGOP will fill out the remaining delegate spots consistent with our bylaws, state law, and the results of the March 1st Presidential Primary,” he said.

Then what are you afraid of?  Trump won the delegates and gets to select his people.  If you don't select the delegates according to the law then there would be a problem.
I support Donald Trump for President of the United States. 
Of course I believe that there are trannies out there. You seem to think that we need to accommodate their mental illness by allowing men to use women's restrooms. Most people disagree with you.

If the GOP beats down the voice of the people, I will never vote for a Republican ever again in my life.

The one downside to /r/republicans is I'm not sure that, at the end of this election, most of us are going to want to be part of that party anymore.
I can tell you right now that I can no longer describe myself as a Conservative after 22 years. But seeing what's happening right before our eyes is making my no long want to associate myself with a political party that wants to silence the voice of the people. Even in closed Republican Primaries, Trump has overwhelming support from registered Republicans. 

I'll never vote for another Republican til the day that I die if they do this. If Trump loses fair and square, I'm cool with that. I'll vote for whoever the Republican candidate is for President. If it's taken despite the people, I'll never vote for an R ever again.  
&gt;I can tell you right now that I can no longer describe myself as a Conservative after 22 years.

I'm in a similar boat. It's not like I changed any views - I'm as right-wing as ever - but someone finally explained to me that conservatives don't conserve anything. I'm a nationalist, among other things. Conservatives, apparently, are not. In fact, the only thing 'conservatives' seem to conserve is previous concessions to some of the worst sociopolitical forces around. No thank you.

Yeah, no. As one redditor notes at https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/4c11jv/establishment_endorsements_dont_make_ted_cruz_an/, Cruz doesn't bend his knee to the "establishment"; they bend their knees to him.
Well, let's hear it then. Or are you just a drive by commentator?
If it goes contested with Trump ahead on votes, and they throw it to Cruz or - God forbid - Ryan or someone else, let Trump go third party. And I mean real third party - not just a single run, but another attempt at building an alternative party. In an ideal world it would involve elected Republicans switching parties to it.

I support Donald Trump for President. 


&gt;Eliminating that amount of debt in eight years is highly impossible, according to most economists, the Washington Post reported. It could require using $2 trillion a year from the annual $4 trillion budget to pay off holders of the debt.

Did you read the article?
I like that he puts a positive spin on the destruction of his party.
Yeah and plenty of economists say the opposite. So?
You're questioning if Trump has the ability to organize and resolve to create new opportunities?
I am. At least in this context. The skills it would take to build a new party could be compared to those required to build groundgame infrastructure - and the lack of such have cost him delegates all along, particularly in caucuses
it's probably realistic.  [the Penny Plan](http://www.onecentsolution.org/the-one-cent-solution/) does it too.  maybe some combo
here's **OUR** problem.  going third party = Hillary win

but Rush points of the R establishment won't care, won't be upset with Hillary in charge.  **ANYTHING** other than giving up (destroying) the good ole boy system in place in D.C. via **both** parties

that's what Trump represents.  a new R party with the establishment on the street instead of in charge
It makes sense that he would want an Open Convention, considering thats the only way left for him to win.

What sources would you accept? And what must their credentials be for you to accept their opinion? 
This is the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds), not to be confused with the reputable organization, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The ACPed has only 60-200 members is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. They purposely chose a name deceptively similar to the AAP in order to confuse people. So yeah, take this article with a bucketload of salt.

&gt;The ACPed has only 60-200 members is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The SPLC is a complete batshit organization. Citing them to knock the ACP is like insisting Trump is a crazy radical, because Bernie Sanders said so.
Fair enough, but the fact remains that the ACPeds formed to oppose adoption by gay couples. They're a fringe conservative group and shouldn't be getting the attention they're getting.

If you're talking about the Human Rights Campaign, I can't stand them either. But at least the HRC doesn't pretend to be this scientific organization. 

Virtually every professional medical organization -- from the American Psychiatric Organization to the American Academy of Family Physicians -- supports transitioning as an effective treatment for gender dysphoria.
Any sources what so ever that back up what he is saying as possible.
Unless its harmful to the health of the person I dont see why it should not be given up for adoption or provided refuge by the state. 

Why is termination acceptable? Its conscious ending of an in development human. Something we have no other way to produce. 


Certainly we should not be advertising it as a womens body right, as it takes two to tango if you catch my drift. 

Kasich needs to drop out. When you cannot possibly win, you're showing how corrupt you are.
It'll be cool to watch him cry when Cruz gets the nomination at the convention and Kasich is left crying over the end of his national political aspirations.
&gt;If you're talking about the Human Rights Campaign, I can't stand them either. But at least the HRC doesn't pretend to be this scientific organization.

Not just them, but they do pretend to have 'scientific facts!' that are more squirrelly than anything the ACP puts out.

As for 'virtually every professional medical organization' - we're talking not just the near-softest of the soft sciences, but organizations that are rife with their own politicking, particularly on any issue that says 'LGBT'. HRC may be heaping praise on organizations that decide that sex change operations are hunky dory to start planning for for preteens, but ruling out the possibility that they're wrong because they go against "consensus" is not convincing.
It'll be cool to watch him cry when Trump gets the nomination at the convention and Cruz is left crying over the end of his national political aspirations.
Don't be an idiot. Cruz is 45 and a Senator from Texas. If he doesn't win the nomination now, he can bide his time and run again in a future cycle without issue. Kasich is 62 and term limited, so he's in a decidedly different position than Cruz if Trump is the nominee. 
True
Not sure you've noticed...  Not many people like Cruz. He's not very popular. He 100% wouldn't be able to pull anyone from the other side to vote for him. Therefore, he'll never be President. 

You need to get real. 
I am a Republican and I'm pro-choice. 
That was Ron being himself.  Consistent to the end.  If Ron had backed the Republican candidate then, to him, everything he said would have been for nothing.  

I always respected that about him.
Not sure if you understand how elections work, but as polarization increases, victory comes from more successfully turning out the base than the opposition can manage, and Cruz is pretty close to the ideal candidate for the Republican base.
Not true. The votes are not Donnie's; they belong to the voters. He has to convince voters to prefer him over Kasich; if he doesn't, that's not Kasich's problem.
He's so ideal that he's not even winning the Republican base vote. 

Makes sense. 
Nuh uh. I'll sue. 
Come on, suggesting that a conspicuously conservative Republican that endorses biblical values and pushes for efforts to rescue people from sexual immorality might have skeletons in his closet?

Nonsense.  No way would something like that ever happen.  
Poland seems to be getting better and better.
I say I'm pro-life, but would never want to ban abortion. You can't create a law that will result in people hurting themselves.
Everyone wants laws to dictate what people can or can't, should or shouldn't do. 
Abortion, like marijuana use, should be allowed but stigmatized.  And the rest of us should be supporting neighbors to our flawed members of society as we are also flawed.

Ah damn, the video has been deleted. I would have found this one interesting to see.
This is *exactly* why I'm torn about this law. I'm traditionally conservative but there are a number of issues. First, actual conservatives tend to want less government interference in the lives of the general population (anti-abortion laws are interference), then people are *going* to get abortions regardless of legality which is scary, and finally it's rare to see fellow conservatives have any plan whatsoever to improve things such as teen pregnancy.

De-funding things like planned parenthood is great and all, but can we please redirect the funding to women's health clinics that will provide birth control to promote safe sex and reduce unwanted pregnancies??
A contested convention would *almost certainly* result in the election going to the Democrat nominee without a fair election.

This must be prevented at all costs.

Whether or not Kasich is helping or hindering this is up for debate, however.
It's about agency.

You can't force a woman to be pregnant if she doesn't want to be.  You have a right to dictate what happens to your body.
If you oppose massive immigration and wish your country to continue to prosper, then opposition to abortion - at least culturally - is a no-brainer. It makes as much, even more sense, as having a government that warns about, regulates and ultimately discourages smoking.

Poland's birth rate is in the shitter. They oppose open borders and mass immigration. Even without the Catholic aspect, they're doing what is sensible.
Pathetic. How can you paint snatching fairly won delegates as a "major victory" over Trump? They make it sound like he's got Trump on the ropes when all he's doing is grasping at straws? 
I could flip that and say a women is not able to become pregnant without a man.

A women cant dictate when to end her partners child.

If the latter is wrong I dont see why.

#TED IS A MESS
Unfortunately, stubborn lyin' Ted will stay in until the convention, even if he mathematically is knocked out. 
He likely already knows. He's still in the race to force a contested convention and deny Trump the nomination.
don't tell r/conservative.  they'll commit suicide right here on reddit
What's been nice about watching the reactions to Trump has been the number of minorities who have come forward to highlight just how tired they are of their own group constantly playing the victim card.

If you call someone stupid enough throughout their childhood, they will grow up believing they are stupid, it will take a tremendous amount of effort to convince them otherwise, and they will ALWAYS suffer from lowered self esteem.

It's the same when you raise millions of people to believe they are victims of oppressive and evil white people when the reality is far from that.

It's also the same when you raise millions of people to believe that they are inherently racist and privileged simply because they are white.

It's nice to see people of all colors dropping that narrative and moving forward together.
I see there's still debate as to what a majority is.
Trump's *only* chance will be to get to 1237. Primaries are like a chess game, not like checkers. Trump doesn't seem to understand all the moves, so he plays chess like a checkers player.
I don't see any reason for Cruz to leave until Trump has the delegates he needs to win the nomination outright. I thought the idea of Cruz winning the first ballot was over long ago and his staying in is just a hope for a second ballot win or at least a way to keep Trump from winning on the first ballot.
I am a Trump supporter but this place should be pro republican, when Trump gets the nomination we can go 100% pro Trump. For now there shouldn't be any anti Trump, Cruz, or Kasich posts.
I don't agree.  I'm a life long Republican and I'm sick and tired of what the Republicans have become over the past 20 years. Ted Cruz is an absolute slime ball and the sleazy tactics he's using during this campaign are EXACTLY what I don't want anymore. 

I am COMPLETELY against Ted Cruz. 

Kasich? Well, he said that he's open to the VP spot being a Democrat. He's only still in this race so that the Republican's can stop Trump via convention. 

If the Republicans go against the voice of the people and steal this election away from Trump, I will never again vote for a single Republican ever again in my life.  If another candidate is fairly selected, I'll vote for whoever that candidate is. 
I am completely against Ted Cruz, i absolutely hate him. I just think the place for this is /r/The_Donald  and not here. If we can't do this then this place just becomes a smaller /r/The_Donald which is unnecessary.
The answer is simple: the rules allow it and Donnie is doing next to nothing to stop it.
I disagree. I am a Republican and I feel as if Republican issues should be addressed here. 

I'm not going to go "hide" in a "safe zone" like /r/the_donald. I'm going to voice my dissatisfaction with the Republicans anywhere I can. 

 
Nobody is "knocked out" until the convention chair announces the nominee.
But look at this place, it is only Trump supporters here. You are preaching to the choir. The point of making it fair is you can actually get people supporting all candidates in here and have actual discussions.
De-funding Planned Parenthood is utterly ridiculous. I have to seriously question those that make this suggestion if they really even know what Planned Parenthood does.  

Abortions are less than 3% of what Planned Parenthood does. The amount of early breast cancer detection that Planned Parenthood is able to give women is literally saving women's lives every single day of the year. That alone makes PP worth it. 

97% of Planned Parenthood's work is mammograms and preventive care unrelated to abortion. 
Oh strange. The absolute dominating front runner is getting the most supporters in a forum designed for his constituents. 

That's so weird. 
I'm aware. It's where my ex got her birth control that allowed us to have safe sex.

Which is why I tell anyone if they're *that* intent on removing abortion as a possibility then simply redirect the funding to another clinic that does all the same stuff minus abortions. Easy solution. If they disagree with that they obviously have ulterior motives.
Here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your school/work or is unavailable for any reason:

What if you want to have a serious discussion about how much you hate Ted and why instead of a meme-off about it?

/r/the_donald is not a place for discussion. It has it's own charms but high-minded discussion is not a quality they pretend to have.
&gt;If you oppose massive immigration and wish your country to continue to prosper, then opposition to abortion - at least culturally - is a no-brainer. 

Run me through the logic here. I don't see what one thing has to do with another unless you're suggesting we combat illegal immigration by out-breeding them.
Thank you!
The difference is the baby is actually physically growing inside the woman's body.

A more compelling argument is that the baby has a right to life.
No problem!
&gt;Run me through the logic here. 

The logic as to why it's important for a nation, certainly an economy, to actually have a population that isn't plummeting?

If so, you can just [start here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/07/japans-birth-rate-problem-is-way-worse-than-anyone-imagined/) for one example. Then realize that what they say about the japanese birth rate is pretty well true for just about every western nation, and quite a lot of the non-western ones. Notice that the demographics issues are viewed entirely in terms of economic impact, societal cohesiveness and otherwise.

The reason immigration is referenced is because this is typically billed as a way to offset the pitiful demographic rates - you just import more people. Obviously, that's off the table (and for good reason) in this case. But that leads you with needing to address the population issue through other means (as opposed to saying 'Screw it, we'll just let things go to hell and pray another solution magically appears.')
Cruz is good at closed, back room private deals. 

He's having a really hard time with the people.

Sealed, just like all of Cruz' records. Hidden from the people.
Its not as simple as stating because the women is holding the cells the male has zero right. 

If it takes two humans to produce those cells the result is both humans are entitled to a form of rights over the cells. 

I would agree with it growing in the women she holds the medical cards, the man is unable to become ill because of pregnancy. 

That said unless its harmful its would be going against the right of the male to conceive a child for the women to have monopoly over termination. 
&gt; the highly unlikely scenario where Trump doesn’t gain enough delegates to win the nomination outright

Wut
As a non-white person who doesn't believe in SJW bullshit, I constantly get attacked. Sad!
Poland is doing some based things, like barring migrants, but this isn't a good thing.
Kasich is literally 4th place in a 3-man race. What a loser.
Don't forget Kaisch and Soros are homeboys. 
Wasn't this subreddit made due the censorship of anything Trump on /r/Republican ?
Yeah, no. A smart person would realize, since (a) Cruz has been remarkably consistent since the 2012 campaign and (b) party leaders are starting to back him more and more, (c) the most rational explanation is party leaders are bending their knees to him and ***not*** the other way around.
"Knocked out" means Cruz won't get 1237. Nobody thought he would get that anyway... This is just old news with a click bait title.
Especially with Trump

FTFY.
Misleading title. One is a model that predicted a Romney victory, and its author even said personalities may be a factor in skewing it. And let's be honest, Romney's personality was a huge liability that led to his loss:

&gt; “If there’s any time in which personalities would trump the economy it would be this election,” Fair said. 

&gt;Fair’s model has correctly forecast all but three presidential races since 1916 but was wrong in 2012, when it predicted a narrow loss for Obama to Mitt Romney.

Sorry should've put a /s on there.  Figured the homeboys would've been sufficient.
Sorry, I've come across too many people who actually believe that. 
Why do you think that this isn't a good thing? It seems like there is still exemptions for life of the mother.

Poland is a Catholic nation, and Catholicism protects the rights of the unborn child. It makes sense to me that they would act in accordance with their religion.
Thanks to you guys, I know know that he isn't funded by Soros... I honestly believed that until now, and thought he was a complete shill! Gotta research *EVERYTHING*, even stuff you think you know.
I don't see why they'd want to and why he'd agree to ruin his career forever like that. 
As a Trump supporter, I can live with that error rate.  
Maybe because the author didn't look hard enough? For example, an NPR article talking about Cruz's release: http://www.npr.org/2016/02/27/468405573/marco-rubio-releases-14-years-of-tax-returns-amid-pressure-on-donald-trump
Ah, the old extortion racket: do what we want or I'll make it harder for your citizens to eat. How's that working with the Cuban embargo? How'd that work with Iraq? How'd that work with Iran? How's that working with North Korea? In each of these cases, the nations ignored us. How'd that work with the embargo of Japan in the 30's? Oh, right, they attacked us.
You conveniently named the counties that it didn't work on. How about you now list off the many many nations is has worked on?

By the way, when you are negotiating a deal, you always come in hard that way you can back off and negotiate.

You're right. We should just let countries take advantage of us out of fear they will attack us. You sound *brave*.

I thought this idea had been floated out months ago.  It is a good idea, as far as it goes.  I do not think it goes far enough

We need a year long moratorium on foreign money transfers by foreigners.  Many illegals will then self-deport, because they are here to send money back home.  When they cannot, they will leave.
[deleted]
Every country you listed is essentially run by a dictator. They will have no trouble making their people suffer and in many cases they actually do it on purpose to keep control over their population. That is a great way to make the Americans look like the villains and why they need to rise up against us. 

Economic sanctions work quite well and while the countries you mentioned were defiant don't think for a second that it didn't help our cause. It is unfortunate that they have a dictator that will use its people like a pawn in a chess match but that can't influence us in making policy. 
How did that work for Japan when they attacked us?
You realize it's not just illegals who do that, right? A lot of legals still do have family across the border who would starve without this.
&gt; Ah, the old extortion racket

there's no extortion.  here's the definition of [extortion](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/extortion?s=t) 
fuck 'em.  I know that sounds harsh, because it is.  I have to consider what works for my family and my country before I consider the needs of foreigners and foreign nations.

And you overstate the case of starvation in Mexico.  People aren't starving.  What they are doing is sending over hordes of people to leach off of our social services and undercut the wages and working conditions of American workers.
This shouldn't be a discussion on immigration. This post is about how were going to get money from Mexico. Trump is using that piece of legislation because we're basically checkmating the Mexican government. Build the wall.
And lets not forget, it's not like Mexico doesn't have a modern economy and government. 

Yes, it has it's flaws and it's corruption. But it's still going to drastically affect the Mexican economy enough that they're going to want to come to the table and discuss a path forward if ever there was an American President that was serious about border protection. 

The U.S. has complete and total leverage on this subject. 
You can try and compartmentalize all you want, but to suggest that when we discuss the financing of a border wall with Mexico that immigration is not relevant to the discussion is to compartmentalize beyond prudence.

how's that for a run-on sentence?
Absolutely, Mexico does not fit in with any of the countries listed and they will do what is in the best interest of their economy long term and that is to play ball. 

Mexico will never write a check to go towards construction of the wall but they will pay for it by making certain concessions via trade or other means. This can happen in one of two ways. They either sit down at the table and negotiate their way to a deal they can live with or we will implement sanctions that we feel are good for America in regard to our current trade and economic relationship with Mexico. 

I think if Trump had done a better job explaining this from the start even more Americans would have jumped on board. I always knew what his intentions were but I think many people don't. 
I'm black and it was nice to grow up in a rural (poor I might add) town where the demographics were around 50% white and 50% black.

You learn real quick the only differences between people is character, ideology, and morality.  That is what separates men from men, not skin tone.

This whole idea of forcing people into a way of thinking, just because of skin tone, is madness.
Same friend!
In my time of studying Candidate Trump, I think one of his weaknesses is that he makes the assumption that people already understand the rules. 

For example, when Trump said that he would temporarily stop Muslims from coming into the U.S., he was assuming that people understood that this was already an option for the President under current Federal Law.  Unfortunately, people aren't educated on this subject so they assumed that Trump was going to do things his own way despite this rule having been law for many many decades. 

Who thinks that Anonymous is still relevant?
I totally agree and I have to place a good amount of that blame on his campaign team. When the campaign decided to run with any of Trumps core issues that in many cases were shaped live on camera by Trump giving off the cuff speeches and news conferences, it is the job of the campaign to shape the argument so it can be deciphered by the American voters. They then need to work with Trump so he delivers the message properly as well as getting people from the campaign to drive the message home on cable news shows. 

I am hoping the new additions to the team will have better luck standing up to Trump to push the correct message moving forward. Trump still needs to deliver it in his same manner but it has to be more polished so the typical American who doesn't follow politics very closely can understand it. If that happened early on in the campaign there would be no talk of contested conventions at this point. Trump would have wrapped this up a long time ago. 
The author makes a fair point:

And this too shall pass.  All things of the earth as dust, and man's vanity is fleeting.

I do hope Trump gets elected, though, because I do not want to see America decline, even if two centuries from now it will make little difference.  What difference did a Lincoln or a Roosevelt make?  Would not Benedict Arnold have served as well as George Washington?  Was Andrew Jackson just an irrelevancy in the course of our nation?

When I put it that way, this author is all wet:  Great men lead the nation to greatness.  Trump will make America great again.
Most working Americans suffer their biggest tax liability through the regressive payroll taxes like social security and medicaid.  They also pay taxes through the sales tax.  

Incorporation will not help with these liabilities.  Only reducing government spending will allow these tax burdens to be reduced.
Didn't Louisiana do just that with Jindal, then have such a shortfall they had to resort to regressive sales tax increases anyway?
I agree 100% on Social Security though.  I'm a Gen X'er and my standard of living is far lower than Baby Boomers at this point in their lives.  Why should I have to pay SS tax to fund their retirements when I know I won't see a dime when I retire?
We all grow old and the notion that we will have this safety net it is a pleasing illusion.

The long term finances of the Social Security system are an interesting study in wealth transference and demographic politics.

Don't forget the disability burden -- you get taxed for that too. More people are going on disability than are getting new jobs to pay that tax.  That is not sustainable.

Ultimately, tax avoidance is a natural thing to do.  If you are rich, you will do what you can to keep your money.  If you are poor, and not a drain on society, then you can only hope for lower taxes to lower your tax burden.  The only way we can lower taxes is to lower spending.  Most spending is on government transfer and welfare programs.  You want more money in the pockets of the poor and middle class?  Cut the programs that need taxes to survive.

Up until the Civil War the federal government took most of it's revenue from import and export tariffs.  Export tariffs on cotton was as great an impetus on Southern secession as was the question of slavery.

The notion that we can tax the rich out of our troubles is false -- Government taxes the poor and middle class not because it is politically popular but because it is necessary, given current levels of spending.

To add further the injury, many of these programs meant to help the poor and middle class, like loan supports for education and housing, only exacerbate the problem through inflation brought about by easy credit.


Good point. Maybe legal status could be taken into consideration.
Yeah, definitely.... they would have to show some proof of legal residency, naturalization, or citizenship to escape a fee.
&gt; to not pay taxes...

myth
Exactly. As time passed during this primary season, Cruz has been winning the war of words and of wills. Most of all, he has been proving himself to be more rational and reasonable than Sr. Trumpo.
They were wrong about Scott Jeb Marco Chris Christie Rubio Bush Walker, what makes them think Paul Scott Jeb Marco Chris Christie Rubio Bush Walker Ryan will do the trick?
Polly want a cracker?
Yeah let's hear from those anonymous 'economists'.

And to make things easier, Sarah Palin, Ben Carson, and Chris Christie are not economists.

EDIT: TIL anonymous economist rhymes, would make a good song title.
Butthurt Trump trolls are making their last stand before the Wisconsin Waterloo.
Salty about Wisconsin, Dr., I see?

Shell companies are a myth?

Can I have a source that backs him up!?
Isolationism, a broad interpretation of legislation, and a rounding of give or take $5B. 

Hard to believe this is what qualifies as Republican policy in this cycle.

Edit: Downvotes and big government to the rescue. Some fucking republicans you guys make.

Backs who up? Trump? There aren't any. I think this is ridiculous.
I'm just shocked that fucking prostitutes, incessant lying, and being foreign born qualifies.
[deleted]
people should stop relating politicians to a trojan horse. we invented that trap and it therefore can't work anymore because we already know the trick. 
If the other candidates act in accordance with the rules and the delegates flip, neither I nor the candidates are to blame; rules is rules.
Unless soldiers are going to pour out of Ted Cruz's stomach in the middle of the night, I don't understand how he is supposed to be a "trojan horse".
Very HIGH ENERGY!
The real 'middle finger' will be given to Trump by the delegates.
Projecting much, Donald?
Really? Nuremberg defense? It is squarely on you if you choose to use the corrupt rules of the rnc to pursue corrupt means to an end, regardless of what is scrawled on paper to give you an out.
That's all I was looking for. I've unsubbed this particular Right sub as its become a baseless Trump echo chamber. Just like Trump, talking big with no substance to back up anything said.
I'm not a Trump supporter. How do you think I was supporting him? I just said there was no evidence to support his claims.
Fuck the GOP and their slimyass moves to stop Trump
Fuck rat face
Stop. Nobody is "knocked out" until the chairman announces the nominee.
Hm, a Trump Cruz ticket. Well, I hate Scruz with a passion but I could live with him as veep for four years. 
At this point Cruz and Kaisch are trying to stop Trump from getting 1237, not getting 1237 themselves. Personally I think this is the "low road" to the nomination. Kaisch didn't even campaign in WI and is spending all his time in NY. Likewise I doubt Cruz spends much time in NY and tries to go after states where he is more favorable. 

Republican politics have become stop Trump, not my policies are better and so I should win. 
[deleted]
.. And by June 7th every candidate will be knocked out.  By the logic of this story, Trump should give up too. 

Now, as to the spirit of the article, there is a difference between Cruz and Kaisch and it is pretty simple.  

Cruz will be able to win on the 2nd or 3rd ballot by combining his delegates, unassigned/undeclared/freed delegates, and faithless Trump delegates.   

There is no scenario that Kaisch can get enough delegates until/unless there is a total deadlock between the Trump/Cruz delegates.  In that scenario, Kaisch is still not going to be the choice as both sides view him as a spoiler not a compromise.


Well, he was right.  

I was surprised (and delighted) by how well Cruz did. I knew he would win, but it was much bigger than I thought.

I was surprised (and disgusted) by Trump's tantrum.  

I was slightly surprised (slightly) that Trump didn't try to pivot to being more presidential.

I was surprised (and disappointed) that Hannity cut away from Cruz's speech so he could interview fellow Trump supporter Gingrich. 

I was surprised (and a bit sad) that CNN had better coverage than Fox most of the night (exception of Kelly).

I wasn't attacking you, I was making remarks about others in the thread.
Ahhhhhhhh the feelings of entitlement 
These are pointless articles. Cruz will mostly stay until the convention in Cleveland. As will Kasich. Their sole purpose is to deny Trump at this point 
Good for the Michigan GOP! I don't like Trump but this effort to use technicalities to take away legitimately earned delegates is bullshit. 
&gt; Kaisch didn't even campaign in WI 

Actually that's the sad part. Kasich DID campaign in WI with phone calls, some door to door, and a low amount of ads. 

Except Cruz has publicly called on Kasich to drop out since he is mathematically eliminated.  He will be a total hypocrite if he doesn't do so and Trump can use this in ads.
His excuse will be "I am the only one who has been able to defeat Donald Trump!"
The party decides the nominee if Trump doesn't get enough votes.  Trump will make his pitch to them, but if they feel like they can get away with ignoring Trump then they will choose Kasich or someone else.  

Cruz is a religious nut who has no support in the party.

Are you just trying to make a joke or do you seriously not understand the meaning here?
&gt; Do you have to be rich to stash your money in a shell company to not pay taxes or can any American do it?

You pay taxes when you earn money.  That is before you have it.  Once it is yours you can put it anywhere you want.  The recent news item about 'offshore accounts' is nonsense. 

How would it 'ruin his career' and why would he care? Do presidents ever go back into politics?  Or do you think he'd lose to Hillary?
He'd lose horribly and be known as the shill fall guy for the donor class forever. 
Well Cruz isn't mathematically incapable of getting enough delegates, I think he needs roughly 88% of the remaining delegates to get the 1237. He won't realistically, but it isn't impossible. Also it favours Cruz if Kasich drops out as he'll probably get most of his votes.

Kasich is a leech, even if he gets the nomination somehow through a brokered convention he won't stand a chance against Hillary. He should drop out. 
&gt;Well Cruz isn't mathematically incapable of getting enough delegates

He will be by April 26th at the current rate/polling.  So if Cruz doesn't drop out by then if (when, I should say) that happens, he's a total hypocrite. 

I think Kasich takes a lot of Trump's votes, so if Kasich drops out it benefits Trump.  Those that are super conservative already go to Cruz, moderates tend to go towards Trump and Kasich.
New York could make it impossible for him at that point to reach the 1237 needed delegate but not impossible to get more then Trump regardless. It's still possible for Trump to not get the required delegates and lose to Cruz.

I'm talking purely in what ifs here. I believe from here on out Cruz will win very little. The south was his stronghold and Trump still beat him. Cruz won't drop out. Doesn't matter if people think he's a hypocrite, he's the establishments choice now. I'd love to be proven wrong though.

I think you're right that he won't drop out at that point.  He should though.
Cruz as VP is problematic, not least of which is the question of whether he is a "natural born citizen", as required by the constitution to be President.

VP is a shitty jib.  Cruz would be wise to angle for the Supreme Court.  He's 44 and could easily sit on the court for 30 years.
Ted Cruz is a horrendous excuse for a human being but I don't think he's going to fail the natural born citizen test. I think the courts and law on that are pretty clear. 

Eh...I could tolerate him as VP. Not as a SCOTUS justice. He's too obscenely conservative on social issues for me to really be comfortable with that thought.
What tantrum?
Not really. Officers tend to have the more powerful guns.
Nearly every poll out there shows Kasich as the only Republican that can win in November.
BLM could have had potential if it started as citizens rights matter, it could have addressed the problems we are facing with government, corporatism, creeping totalitarianism, etc. would have been even stronger if they teamed with OWL. Instead, they both have both little to no leadership and border line terrorism. I Agee on the changes that need to happen, but until they can get their shit together nothing is going to change except pissing off ordinary citizens.

Bernie's just a sparring partner for her. Worse, he'll be used as a proxy fundraiser, since it won't be difficult to decide what his campaign and related PACs do with their leftover money when he "loses" the nomination. I almost feel bad for that old man and his supporters. Almost.
Way to emulate Drudge and pull the religious smear, Ann. I saw that coming from miles away. 

There's only one problem with that inference.... you don't know it yet, but you're already deep inside the Trumpkin cult of personality who think it's a good idea to sexualize 1 year old girls.
You bet he does.  I think the party is using him to get rid of Trump and I also think he knows it.  Really sad.  I wonder what he is going to get in return.  Did they tell him this is not your time but if you help us do this in 4 years it will be your time?  
I heard the founder is Muslim.  They tend to do well with disenfranchised groups.  
Thats the only reason he is in the race.  I bet they told him that he won't get it but if he gets them to a contested convention it will be good for him 4 years from now.
I guess I am not the establishment.  Trump through and through.
Who says the talking heads?  I just listened to two women on MSNBC in two different interviews pepper their conversation with words like lie and lose over and over.  They both were there to convince the public that this is so.  They haul out well heeled women to do this to convince other women not to vote for him.  I am a woman who owns a business and works 48 hours a week.  I do not need some "fancy hairdo, chunky necklaced well dressed female nobody", who was dragged out for the purpose of telling me what to think,  spew at me her "subliminally peppered" prepared argument.  
Scandalous.  She is not immoral but her actions are when she says this.  We need to protect humans at all stages of life. 
I am kicking the republican party to the curb if they don't stop embarrassing me with their obvious plans to control this election.  
Muslims and African Americans have a really long history, so that doesn't surprise me. It just seems to me that an all inclusive movement would accomplish more. There are a lot of issues for African Americans. On the past I didn't understand institutionzed racism because, well, it's the norm. Then one day when I was bored I wa looking the history of blacks being granted to vote and people, especially weren't into that. "Coincidently" around that time felony disenfranchisement really took off.. Then they started arresting blacks at a much higher rate than anything previously all to strip them of the right to vote. We have made a lot of headway on race in the USA but this sort of shit still happens. It's not going to change without outcry from all races. I have seen it first hand many times. Cops will just search black folks for no real reason than "suspicion". Meanwhile other flavors of people I know get away with murder. 
White privilege in this country has caused this.  We went from slavery to segregation.  White privilege is what is still the unfairness of being black in the US.  It is no surprise they are upset and following this kind of leadership.  We may not see it as clearly but we are still on the road to equality in this country.  
I am a full believer that white and black aren't really races so much as social classes. For instance the Irish for the longest time weren't considered white, because they were low class and occupied the same ghettos as black folks. This is why you see so many African Americans with Irish names-- Murphy, O'neal, etc. for some reason Irish were granted whitehood, along with middle easterners, Europeans, and North Africans. So I mean, it should be clear is a made up ethnicity basically to rob people of their own ethnicity and identify as the class of white. It still is a class. I don't know about you guys but I have renounced my whitehood and gone back to my roots. The situation was almost the same for black slaves. They came from many different cultures -- black peoples have more genetic variation than any other "race" be because black isn't a race. It was a means to rob African Americans of their cultural identity when they were brought over as slaves. White was to force a melting pot situation.  Sorry for the rambling, but that is my take on white and black-- they are to keep us as classes separate.
&gt; Did they tell him this is not your time but...

Hmmm, wouldn't the question be if Cruz is making deals with the GOP establishment he claims to be opposing? 
in fact Obama DOES have the power because the Republicans have not opposed any claim/action he's taken
Of course he is. He's not in the race to win the nom, that's clear. Nor is Kasich. 
yea, the whole Northeast is a landmine for Cruz who has very little appeal outside his bible base, oh, plus, all the bloody ears Trump hating reddit "must be pure" conservatives
&gt; We may not see it as clearly but we are still on the road to equality in this country.

In 1970 blacks were equal to whites in all statistics.  Today a higher percentage of blacks are on welfare, 72% of black kids are born without a father, and half of all murders in the US are committed by black men or 6% of the population. 

We are not on the road to equality because the problem isn't 'white' the problem is liberals creating a black victim culture and teaching blacks how to live off welfare and pop out kids for money.  With 25% of blacks being on welfare and the fact that women on welfare have kids at 3x the rate as those not on welfare the problem is going to continue to get worse quickly.

Yep
Great Article because it says up front what most all media avoided

&gt; Until now, the only primaries Cruz has won are in Texas (his home state), Oklahoma (basically the same state) and Idaho (where Trump never campaigned).  So now, Cruz has finally won an honest-to-goodness primary

and this is supposed to be some kind of game changer.....geez

Cruz will be destroyed in New York and the rest of the Northeast

too bad, because they only way non politicians can win in 2016 is for Cruz and Trump to team up.  Cruz, the VP, Cruz the VP for 4 years then run for president as Trump retires (if they haven't already killed him)
hopefully to talk some sense into Cruz, such as STOP trying to destroy your running mate
I don't get it, so all 3 of them aren't gonna be the nominee? Who will be? Why would primary voters vote for this unknown candidate? They are handing the election to Hillary. 
So explain how affirmative action which places race above merit is a good thing?
Trump will be if he gets 1237, otherwise probably Romney or Ryan. 

If it's Romney or Ryan, the GOP is finished forever. I tear up my registration, and so do millions of Trump supporters. We write-in Trump anyway. 
Exactly. It's just so idiotic. Bout time tho 
I don't think it is.  It was put in to counter the previous condition that merit did not get the job if you weren't white.  Now we have this condition.
Salivating at their chance to impliment laws using similar methodology. Though if they're planning to undo laws via this method it should be noted that their laws can also be undone. 
Seriously. What's the difference between occupy wall street and illegal immigration? One of them gets associated with rape and pretty much got killed off by the media passive aggressiveness.
Well that *would* explain why he looks so swollen all the time...
Where your money comes from has an enormous influence on a person's priorities. Unlike the dominant voices in American lobbying, Donald Trump's fortune is primarily in real-estate, and his family is Nouveau rich. Free trade, IP control, the Military industrial complex, resource extraction, and other such things do not concern or interest him. His fortune is linked to the value of land, and the prosperity of a region.

 This is why the establishment opposes him. He doesn't need their money to get elected, and he has no interest in coddling their industries if they are acting against the nation's interests... because the nation's interests are Trump's interests. Trump's fortune is linked to the success of the nation in a very concrete tangible way that other multi-national corporations and financial empires aren't.
Do you see conspiracies in your Cheerios?
No, but I do see corporate-controlled-news media invested by Islamic Sunni-sect Saudi Arabians, the rising unemployment of Americans due to NAFTA, and corporate-lobby/special interest-funded politicians pushing for the TPP that will kill off the American worker.
I support Donald Trump for President of the United States. 
"kill off the american worker" 
If your job can be exchanged for an unskilled, non-english speaking person; then you haven't done enough to earn that job.

He's doomed. The primary voters have spoken pretty clearly for both Trump and Cruz. It needs to be one of those- whoever attains the most delegates, most likely Trump.
She can't stand the quiet but true rederick of an old socialist calling her a shill.
How is she supposed to handle putin, cuba and the clusterfuck of the middle east?
What the fuck did Mississippi ever do to you huh?

We've been in the Union far longer than a majority of states.

What makes you think that you, some shriveled up british cuck in The United Islamic Kingdom, can try and force the state who's people have bled and died for this country out of the Union. 

&gt;Backwards state would be better off gone

I'm sorry, but what you call backwards a lot of people call minor cultural differences, and its these same "abhorrent" backwards ways that make us so willing to defend the country we live in, and speak what we think. 

This shit right here is exactly whats wrong with you fucks, y'all aren't even American yet you think you have the right to decide whats good for America. Do you get up and say your national anthem, and pledge every day during school, and even at work? Yeah, well I do, and every one else here did too. 

God Bless America, and Mississippi too for supporting her.
First part, restating a point she agrees with from the Drudge Report is perfectly fine.  Second, you're using the red herring argument fallacy.  I now can't defend the Trumpkin' viewpoint without you inadvertently being pro pedo.  It's funny because you're literally doing the kind of smearing she was talking about that the Clintons perfected.

I think you're in the wrong sub, here you go buddy.  /r/hillaryclinton
What's going to give Trump the nomination (I hope) is the fact that these guy's careers are over if they run at the convention and then lose in November.  Look at Rubio.  Imagine something 10x more embarrassing.  No one, other than Kasich who seems more than happy to lose, wants to be remembered as that guy who stole it from Trump and then got his ass kicked.  These guys have giant egos too
Paul Ryan has repeated multiple times that he isn't seeking the nomination.

WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD SCARE US ALL.
He has a tough primary I think, but it's a good ad IMO for Trump or Cruz, though I think Trump wins the no-identity politics competition.
Reeks of establishment
I support Ted Cruz for Rat King
Last bit makes no sense Trump is a CEO. This whole rant sounds fascist "put aside your differences and stand with Trump". 


Already Trump has started making America great again. By himself, he derailed the entire Bush dynasty, torpedoed Rubio, has ruined Kasich, and is now reducing Ted Cruz to nothing but ashes.

Imagine what he'd do with Clinton or Sanders.
He also repeatedly said he didn't want to be Speaker of the House.

He's doing a classic denial, making people beg, giving him maximum leverage. Ryan is giving a master class on negotiation while Trump gaffes and bumbles away what should have been a sure thing. 
[removed]
But he is exposing it. He gets a pass.
Or found it!
People have to start somewhere. There will always be unskilled labor by bringing manufacturing back to America though tariffs you increase the demand for unskilled labor which some Americans do need. In addition bringing those job back here will spur the industry to make greener technologies. You think that all non-skilled or manual labor jobs should be shipped overseas or done by illegal immigrants? 
So you are saying that if I wanted to work construction in California the amount of illegal labor has no affect on me? I have to pay for car insurance, do they? I have to pay for Obamacare, do they?

Your position is 100% pro Democrat. If the working class cannot find decent jobs, they are more likely to vote for liberals who promise to strengthen the social safety net. 


the syrians must not have had it happen to them. We are lucky americans that had a history lesson that we all remembered because we snickered when the teacher said trojan. 
In case you were wondering how the system works, he went to Israel for his job [interview last week](http://www.jta.org/2016/04/04/news-opinion/politics/house-speaker-paul-ryan-congressional-delegation-meet-in-jerusalem-with-netanyahu).  Now there is an approved alternative in the pipeline for when Hillary gets indited.  Heir and a spare.
And software Trojan horses - which work thousands of times a day. 
I voted for Ron Paul.  I would vote for Rand, it just wasn't his year and his mood seemed odd, like he didn't want to run.  Anyway, there are a lot of libertarian people behind Trump I'm sure. Rand is not a loser, maybe a grumpy candidate, but not a pushover loser like the rest.
Not all rich people are evil.

&gt;Fascism: an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.

There's nothing wrong to be proud of your country and thinking about it first. 

I disagree with the authoritarian part—that's why we have the Constitution, but it seems the current government is ignoring it.
That's only fair. It's pretty much Ben Shapiro's standpoint anyway.
She's right legally speaking (As far as the US goes), as much as people don't like it.

There's been a number of legal cases over the years that have consistently held that fetuses do not have rights. You may recall a case (10+ years ago IIRC) where a boyfriend assaulted his pregnant girlfriend and caused a miscarriage. When the boyfriend was charged with murder/manslaughter he was convicted, but the conviction was thrown out precisely for that reason.

A number of states at the time then passed laws that made causing a miscarriage intentionally a felony. These laws are still on the books, but are narrowly constructed. IIRC they're call ed fetal homicide laws. 
I hope Rand has a long and successful Senate career, where his skill at rhetoric and argument will serve him well.  He is not well-suited to be President.  He lacks the charisma and executive ability.
I'm triggered :(
I wish Ron Paul was young enough to keep running.
Trump will expose them to the public... He will point out the plunderers and name names. 
&gt;DT:  ...We’re not a rich country. We’re a debtor nation. We’ve got to get rid of — I talked about bubble. We’ve got to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt.

&gt;BW: How long would that take?

&gt;DT:  I think I could do it fairly quickly, because of the fact the numbers . . .  .

&gt;BW: What’s fairly quickly?

&gt;DT:  Well, I would say over a period of eight years.

He literally says "We’ve got to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt" followed by "I could do it fairly quickly ... I would say over a period of eight years"
This looks and sounds scary.  Like some ominous prediction of people's minds being altered. 
Never said rich people were evil. But you can't on one hand complain the country is being run by rich elite and on the other hand encourage people to vote for a billionaire. It's hypocritical to the max
No one gets a pass
Ben Shapiro came to my university recently. Fortunately there were no protests (to be found), and he was a great speaker whom I greatly enjoyed listening to. It's a shame that people try to shut this man down because they don't agree with him. They're using the very same censorship that they protest against.
Donald Trump is the rich, influential person we needed to fight against the "elites." We needed a vanguard to fight fire with fire in a system dominated by money. 

The amount he makes does not determine his character.
I don't think OP is in support of this "petition." Since it only has two supporters and the letter behind it is one sentence long, I highly doubt its even serious.

I question why OP even linked it  
Same logic could be used for literally any candidate. 

For example 

"Hillary Clinton is the political influential person we need to fight against the political elite" 

Support your candidate fine but if you use hypocritical arguments to support them well this is what happens. 
I'm disgusted that someone who isn't even from America has the gall to even suggest this even if nothing will come of it.
True. Looking at it again, I see that the creator is from the UK. Didn't we tell those red coats to stop fucking with us back in 1776?
[deleted]
Sounds like the opposite: the lower taxes for smaller breweries argument is more compelling.
I second the motion. Rand is a true believer in Liberty.
Rush has talked about "their chance to implement laws using similar methodology" and points out there's no way Dems and the media would allow anything at all extralegal
What is the point you are trying to get across here? That the bubble is ever-increasing? That higher education is a waste right now? That Federal intervention caused this bubble? 
In r/ politics this identical post is 29% upvoted.  Liberalism only works if you bury it in ignorance.
Fiscally conservative, federal intervention.
Those states also aren't on the edge of being bankrupt. Shocker- free stuff costs money!
&gt;  "He has no hope of reaching 1,237 delegates before the convention," the Journal editors wrote, "but what Messrs. Trump and Cruz really fear is that the convention might want to nominate a potential winner."

&gt; So let's consider the case for John Kasich. He's outlasted early favorites like Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and Scott Walker. As of this week, Kasich is the only Republican in the race who consistently beats Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup, winning by a six-point average margin on Real Clear Politics. He's also the only Republican with higher favorables than unfavorables, by 43 to 30, a 13-point positive margin. 

And this is the part that confuses me so much.  Why does he not get more support for this.  It makes no sense to fall on the sword of ideological purity if there is no victory to be gained. 

And I know people are going to argue that a contested convention runs counter to the will of the people.  But what about the people that voted for Carson, Paul, and Rubio?  What would the voting outcome have been if had been Kasich, Cruz, and Trump all along?  These are basically strawman arguments.  the fact is in a contested Delegates will be forced to see the political landscape in a completely different light than it is right now. 

I feel they will see it's not about appeasing what amounts to 35% (be it trump's side or Cruz's side) of the party, it's about finding a solution the entire party can agree on. And regardless of how he's selected, everyone can agree Kasich is the one that truly bridges every aspect of the party.

Is his campaign rough around the edges?

Sure but look at what he's been able to do with what amount to just a quarter of what the other guys have spent. And imagine what he could do if had the full backing of the party?

And I know we keep harping this but he is our best chance at beating Hillary. And whether you accept that fact or not it won't change the fact that trump won't and Cruz can't.

Trump has tarnished any chance he has of appearing sane to the avg voters. Cruz is too vilified by his colleagues to be an effective administrator.

Kasich simply makes sense and I hope that others will see this as well. 
Honestly, I think this paints the case that we should not require so many gen ed requirements for degree.  

What I mean is why should half my degree be spent on classes that have nothing to do with my major?
Its a big bubble, I would not want to hold this debt.  It only compounds the concerns found in this article

Solved: Why Poor States Are Red and Rich States Are Blue

One of the great conundrums of the American political scene is why the poorer states, colloquially known as “red” states, tend to vote Republican or conservative, while the richer states, the “blue” ones (and let it be said that this is very confusing for this European, for over here the colours tend to work the other way around, red is Labour, or left wing) tend to vote Democrat. We would think that it should be the other way around, the poor people voting for more from that Great Big Pinata which is government. But it seems that there’s a simple solution to this: the red states aren’t actually poorer in terms of the way people live.

If we measure by consumption patterns then it’s the blue states that are poor, the red states that are rich:

Blue states, like California, New York and Illinois, whose economies turn on finance, trade and knowledge, are generally richer than red states. But red states, like Texas, Georgia and Utah, have done a better job over all of offering a higher standard of living relative to housing costs. That basic economic fact not only helps explain why the nation’s electoral map got so much redder in the November midterm elections, but also why America’s prosperity is in jeopardy.

Red state economies based on energy extraction, agriculture and suburban sprawl may have lower wages, higher poverty rates and lower levels of education on average than those of blue states — but their residents also benefit from much lower costs of living. For a middle-class person , the American dream of a big house with a backyard and a couple of cars is much more achievable in low-tax Arizona than in deep-blue Massachusetts. As Jed Kolko, chief economist of Trulia, recently noted, housing costs almost twice as much in deep-blue markets ($227 per square foot) than in red markets ($119).

That particular piece then goes on to chunter away about how appalling it is that people aren’t willing to vote for more blue state type of policies and how this will be the end of America. However, the really interesting part of it is that part quoted above. For it speaks to something that economists just keep trying to point out to people. Yes, sure, income inequality might be important in a way, wealth inequality should have a place in our thoughts. But what really matters to people about how life is lived is consumption. Levels of consumption and also consumption inequality. That last is important in a political sense currently because consumption inequality just hasn’t widened out as much as income and wealth inequality have. And levels of consumption: well, that’s really what income or wealth is, the ability to purchase consumption. And if you’re in a place where prices are lower, leading to greater consumption (whether of food, or square feet of housing, or leisure, or whatever), well, then you’re richer, aren’t you?

And thus is our conundrum solved. The red states aren’t in fact poorer than the blue states. They’re richer: that’s why they vote more conservative and more right wing.

We could, of course, take yet another point from this essay:

For blue state urbanites who toil in low-paying retail, food preparation and service jobs, for the journeyman tradespeople who once formed the heart of the middle class, for teachers, civil servants, students and young families, the American dream of homeownership — or even an affordable rental apartment — is increasingly out of reach. Adding insult to injury, rapid gentrification in these larger knowledge hubs brings the constant threat of displacement of creative workers. For even the much better paid techies, engineers, financiers and managers who are displacing them, the metropolitan version of the American dream is a cramped condo or a small house and a long commute. Many are opting to move to cheaper red states instead, further driving their growth.

That rather shows that the way that the blue states are run isn’t conducive to good living standards for the poorer half of the population, doesn’t it? Or, as we might put it, blue, liberal, policies don’t actually do what they say on the tin, aren’t in fact pro-poor. All of which is something that ties in nicely with something we noted from Joe Stiglitz yesterday. Restrictive zoning is very much more common in those blue states than it is in the red. And housing is still a family’s largest single expense. Meaning that by artificially pushing up the cost of housing those blue states are indeed making life worse for the poor. The adoption of build anything anywhere (almost, we’re not quite ready for a steel plant in Manhattan) policies would thus improve the lives and fortunes of the poor substantially.

But that is to become perilously close to snark about all of this. That basic and first observation still stands though. That puzzle of why people in places with lower incomes tend to vote right wing is solved. Because those lower income places have even lower prices, making consumption standards higher. There is therefore no conundrum. The richer people, by the only standard that actually matters, that consumption, are voting right wing, the poorer are voting left.

What we now need to go on and explain is why those nominally left policies, those blue ones, are so to the disadvantage of the poor they’re supposedly helping….

leave it up to the states bruce and stop trying to shove the federal government down our fucking throats libs!
NOBODY legitimately want Kasich. 
 http://i.imgur.com/bMmOCOi.jpg 
that's for sure
lol Pedro is bipolar than a teenage emo girl on Tumblr
Yeah, Bruce is nuts. Went to one of his concerts and had to wash the liberal stink off afterwards. Never again.
Stop trying to undermine the will of the people GOP. 
We're not as bad as we've been made out to be, we socially conservative Christians.

Also, never thought I'd see this sentiment expressed on reddit, thank you for making my day more surprising in a good way!
You can't shit on /r/conservative then turn around and do the same shit they do. 
Cuckoldry? Degeneracy? At least wait for the Hastert trial to be off the front pages because you try this.

Q:  why would you **hate** ?
There is the Left and there is the religious right.  The rest is the 'silent majority'.  Without Christians the Left would have taken over by now.  Christians are the only ones opposing Leftist control over textbooks and education for example.  

Common core is a victory for the Left over control of education since its now federalized.  Look at the military - after 8 years of Obama throwing out Christians it is now a progressive shithole. 

You need something to rally around and you need to teach your kids the 'protestant work ethic' or you end up with the mentally ill liberal  Left.  

Trump is the only hope for the US of the silent majority becoming a dominant force.  Where 'working hard' is an American value and PC is derided as the illness it is.  I detest the Christian right's control of the government, but without them we would not have seen how horrible the Left is until it was too late. 
Those numbers are completely inaccurate and everyone knows it. 
There's a difference between being a degenerate in your personal life and promoting degeneracy among the population. 
I've come to a similar conclusion.
Even as weak and soft as modern Christianity is it's still a better foundation for society than the rolling tumult of self consuming ideas we see in today's left.
Watching western Europe's encounter with Islam has been eye opening. Technologically, the Islamic world is a joke. Yet culturally they are shockingly powerful. When faced with everything western culture sees as evil: real patriarchy, true rape culture, intense tribalism/bigotry, their response has been total surrender.  

Poland and the USA will hold out longer due to lingering religiosity.
I'm typically the type of guy that would vote for a centrist like Kasich... But I just cannot bring myself to support that dweeb
What did i just read?
Don't forget Hungary, they won't wanna miss out on driving Muslims away from western Europe and the US/Canada.

It'll be a fun knights of the round table event, I'd imagine
On the other hand, maybe it's the same group of shitbags realizing that the left is now a stronger position to bully people from than the right, and migrating over.

These people never were religious. They liked the power that religion gave them.
I find the worst to be being an abuser of children in your private life while you promote "morality" in public. 

BTW, do you equate promoting equal rights with promoting degeneracy? 

No. The first three words of my post are "I'm an atheist". Why would I care if gay people get married? 

Then I am confused, what promoting of degeneracy do you mean? What degeneracy? Generally that is a code word for gay.
I come from an multiracial family. The most hardcore Republican I know is a loud and proud gay man. You liberal twats need to stop assuming everyone who disagrees with you is a bigot. 

I think its degenerate to have an abortion 8 months into a perfectly healthy pregnancy. I think its degenerate to have multiple kids by multiple partners and not work while using drugs because the government supports your lifestyle. I think its degenerate to not investigate child rape because you're afraid of being called a racist. 
I think I've come to find pretty much the same thing.  The liberal media misrepresents them horribly.  I still go to church despite being an atheist (because of family), and every time, it is about loving each other, or being nice to fellow man, not hating certain groups of people like the media would lead one to believe. 
Nope. I think the "religious right" has been, sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly, accused of dominionism, in which they strive to make America a theocracy. No, the religious right believed, and still do, that America's best days are when we left each other alone, when the government stayed out of our lives, and when our country still had an ethic of strong work, good character, and charitable giving.
Yeah, look at what they're trying to normalize now. It may be sooner than we thing that they're trying to normalize much, much more heinous things.
I think its degenerate to legalize men going into ladies' rooms legally to get their rocks off.
Yes being a Christian should never be about caricatures from Westboro Baptist. It should never be about us trying to conquer the world in the name of Christianity. 
It is about us changing the world's heart and character by promoting a model of Christ in the way we live. It's about sacrificial love. It's about the rejection of evil in our own lives, and the strength of conviction and conscience even under coercion. The founders knew that plain well when they wrote our founding documents.
&gt; I think its degenerate to have an abortion 8 months into a perfectly healthy pregnancy.

Does that actually happen? Who is *promoting* doing that?

&gt;I think its degenerate to have multiple kids by multiple partners and not work while using drugs because the government supports your lifestyle.


Somehow I don't believe you are "beginning" to change your mind on this.


&gt;I think its degenerate to not investigate child rape because you're afraid of being called a racist. 

OK, what does that have to do with American politics?
How is keeping the government from controlling business decisions and letting those who prove themselves to succeed Democrat? Its Capitalism. 
You can not have it both ways and then complain.
&gt; You think that all non-skilled or manual labor jobs should be shipped overseas or done by illegal immigrants?

Do your legs hurt? Because that was a large jump to get to that conclusion. 
You can absolutely choose to not pay for car insurance. Its just a risk that you would have to make.
I was thinking the exact same thing the other day. Our morals have degraded proportionately with the rise of liberalism.
Its not that its offensive.  Its lies. No need to support that.  If its actual news then you can link a reputable site.
I've been thinking about the same thing recently. I used to debate Christians a lot and one of the things they would mention was morality. Where does morality come from if not religion? I think this is a concept they didn't even fully grasp. As an atheist, I find it absurd that only the Bible can tell me murdering and child molesting is wrong. But it's not really about morality. It's about having a unified country. It's about having the same culture, coming from the same source, and understanding one another because we all do similar things.

Pat Buchanan once called it social capital. We only have so much social capital. We can only have so much energy to expend on different cultures. This will come to balkanization of the USA that we're seeing today.
Hate has a lot of meanings and a lot of different levels. I think the OP means hate in terms of great annoyance. He's not using hate in terms of a loathing, vicious, hostility. Although if you just read the OP I think the context is pretty clear.
Who wants to debunk every anti-Trump article? Are we at a loss to hear about anti-Trump nonsense? Seriously, that's just spinning our tires. We know, the media are a bunch of liars that continuously spew out hateful shit against Trump.

Enough.
These kinds of statistics are irrelevant. Not every Republican nor Democrat is the same. And just because a Republican or Democrat is in power doesn't mean they can take credit for everything that happens in the state.

You have to follow policy points back to their originators and see if the reason they were implemented were logical and if the outcome was positive or negative.
&gt;Does that actually happen? Who is promoting doing that?

Hillary said abortions should be "safe, legal, and rare" and she got roasted by progressives for the "rare" part. There are many examples of it in /r/s4p. I actually consider myself pro-choice, but I think these progressives on the hard left have a sick attitude towards it. 

&gt;Somehow I don't believe you are "beginning" to change your mind on this.

I don't even know what you mean. 

&gt;OK, what does that have to do with American politics?

Because the same problems that caused that tradgey exist here. You can't even fart near a liberal without being called a racist. 
If you are a scientist which most atheists are you will have heard of the god particle. Just saying. Why would you have to wait until it's almost too late to realize the social benefits when the intellectual evidence is mounting.
He probably has 81% of the delegates then, right?
I agree completely. I am also an atheist who has always considered himself conservative but was always put off by the religious right. It has provided a level of morality possibly through having a unified culture across our country. I agree that religion does help instill morality even though I disagree with the premise it is based on.
That is why even republicans should try to vote Sanders in the primary. 4 years with Clinton is not an option, but she is leading at the moment.
Same. I'm a deist but I think Christianity has helped hold the morals of this country together for this long. Not everybody needs religion to be a good person, but a lot of people do.

I don't know how any of what Trump says, or claims, could actually improve the country. His trade policies alone would be an epic disaster for America. It's so strange how Trumpers cannot see this. 

It's sort of weird he's on the list of notable Republicans in this sub...seeing as how he isn't a Republican and his notoriety is not for anything he's done for America.
It's called "convenient censorship". Idiots can't stand to have their feelings hurt!!
I lost faith in Christian Church and won't call myself Christian. I try to get informed in social issues and live my life in the most efficient and logical way of thinking. Now, I don't agree with how they get there but somehow I ended up living exactly a conservative man's ideal would have.

  I'm in traditional family now, no free sex no drug and alcohol only in moderation. Also I don't smoke and party.  I work hard, be self sustaining guy that's why I hate socialism, not the ideal but the practice and what it's done to the soul of many people.

  A lot if not majority of conservative ideas are just common sense really.

&gt; Because the same problems that caused that tradgey exist here.

Then give some examples.

edit:

You claimed people are promoting aborting a fetus in the 8th month. Can you give some examples of this? And don't show me a reddit post, I can find any given garbage claim you want in  on-line media. 

I was like you once. I am still not religious but I believe in morality and the fact that our history is firmly grounded in christianity, whether I like that or not it just is.
Don't know if it's universal anti-Trump, but there's nothing wrong with banning Huffington post, that rag is utter garbage.
The article literally wasn't even anti trump. It mentioned him literally once, and just made a point about his delegate count. Theres no reason to block an entire website just because it might hurt your feelings
Centuries of dealing with the asshole of empires that was the ottoman empire. 
Christianity may be considered useful, but the religion thrives when it's under the most pressure. As cultural forces continue to advance against it, the overall numbers of people who identify as Christian may decline, but the religiosity of those who remain will increase. What happens next is that those remaining within the fold are kept so devout and faithful that they begin to attract new members back to Christianity and we see another "great awakening".
Color me surprised.
You know what other kind of socialists were heavily in favor of censorship?
Good thing we passed all those tax cuts.  Wouldn't want to be in debt or anything.

That's not what the god particle is. 
Exactly 
I'm confused. Can you put each of these comments in context?
I don't need a lot of context to laugh at idiots. 
Hillary Clinton has taken enormous contributions from others, your analogy falls apart.
I come from a background almost identical to yours (atheist, former liberal, turned off by the religious right) and I could not agree more. 
This article is from a few years ago. Still, it might be a good overview, because he apparently has been working in the private sector for a few years.
Be that as it may, I still want some context for the comments.
Interesting point. People sometimes forget facts remain facts even when stated by someone one doesn't like.
sure
Kasich had town halls in Wauwatosa and Waukesha.  Former WI Gov.  Tommy Thompson showed up at the 1st one to endorse him.

I noticed that, too. Hilarious.

It's the party's primary and they can do whatever they want. If candidates don't like it, they can run third party.
The problem arises because this is a *democracy* and we're supposed to vote, not "they can do whatever they want." What kind of thinking is that? That's what loses a democracy.
OK, I know this has been repeated *ad nauseum* by other people, so I'll keep it short and to the point.

a) This is not a democracy. This is a constitutional republic. We don't vote for the candidates in an election, we vote for electors, which represent our party during the actual process. See Constitution, United States, for details.

b) Even if this were a democracy as such, what the party is going through now is not an election, and the primaries that are being held by each state are held by the state party, not the federal level, to determine the delegates from each state.

c) Did you know that libertarians and green party candidates don't get elected for the nomination? Nope, the party chooses them directly. Who woulda thunk? Libertarians!

d) If you think the Republican primary system is unfair, you should see the Democrats... I mean, superdelegates? Hillary basically got a running start with those superdelegates, and now Bernie has no chance.

So before you lecture anyone on what a democracy is or is not, please take the time, and maybe inform Donald as well, to learn the intricacies of the American political system, and realize the difference between a party nomination system and an actual election.

Oh and while you're at it, remind The Donald that he still can opt to run 3rd party, free and clear, as long as you go with him.
I think it's a hilariously rotten move, but in a way it's good - it exposes what the GOP is really like, and makes it easy to pick out the shittiest people in the party, since they'll be the ones loudly and cluelessly defending the move.
The big problem is that there is a duopoly on elections and nobody holds the parties accountable at all. Hillary and Cruz fans (ever since he became the establishment darling) love to say they're private organizations and can do whatever they want but ethically for the sake of democracy there needs to be some form of action against them.
If the Republican Party in Colorado wanted to pick their delegates by playing a scotch-pong tournament that would be fine with me. I don't live in Colorado. If Coloradans don't like the system or think that it is unfair they can change it. It's no secret how each state selects candidates, if you live there and didn't know previously or knew and didn't work to change it than shut up and get to work. If you succeed, good job, if you fail than I guess that's the system Colorado republicans want. If you don't live in Colorado, just shut up. I don't want Coloradans telling me that my state has to elect all the delegates at a convention, so I won't tell them they need a primary.
I think that if Trump was a serious presidential candidate he would have learned how the Colorado system worked and gotten some delegates. His efforts in Colorado were a farce, couldn't even spell the name of his state campaign chair correctly.
Thanks, I was aware of how rigged the election is on the left is already but that's not an excuse for Colorado. You're probably not trying to make it out to be, but all you really said was "Don't cry, others have it worse"

&gt;we vote for electors

*Not in Colorado!*

I also believe Donald has said a few times that if he does not get the nomination he's running third party. I know for sure he would lose some boter support simply because you need to change voter affiliation and such, but the majority of his voters will go with him.
The only difference between what they're doing in terms of censorship and what they're claiming in terms of censorship is what is actually being censored. There's no distinction between the action, only the motive
Refusing to follow an unlawful order is ridiculous? So, Donnie thinks a president should be above the law?
I live in Colorado and local radio is covering how Trump delegates were harassed and forced out of the primary process by those in power. The system is rigged to ensure those in power stay in power. The Colorado GOP is reprehensible.
apparently, [Cruz is into STEALING](http://www.wnd.com/2016/04/trump-erupts-as-cruz-sweeps-colorado-without-votes/) 'em too
mods tend to be corrupt per their own agendas, most subs
yep, this is the thing I find funny.  They all do this until they can't then they act like people are being unfair.
One of our problems right now is that we aren't a democracy, but a representative Republic, and this election has exposed just how HIDDEN the power brokers are.


If GOPe supporters are going to brag about how us Trump peasants deserve to lose because we don't know their convoluted and ever-changing party rules, then it's time for us to either force all political parties to operate by a consistent playbook or its time to deny every political party access to public funds to run their corrupt process.
seems totally obvious Trump is right and Cruz is totally corrupt

**Your'e Fired** Mr. punk CIA

only three people **EVER** were waterboarded and with **OUTSTANDING** [benefits to America](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/222729/waterboarding-has-its-benefits-deroy-murdock)
but he can win.  a brokered convention is a possibility and he might be able to get the nomination that but only if he stays in the race. its improbably that the delegates would give it to someone not currently running. 

When I say "can win" I mean its possible, I'm not saying how likely it is.
I'm not from the state so I don't know exactly how their state party apparatus is set up. In general I would say they should go to their local Republican Party meetings, get active in the party in their community (this means doing basic things: put signs together, make literature packets, edit call or walk lists, make calls, knock on doors). Talk to the oldest woman in the room. If anyone is likely to know the party rules and procedure at a local club meeting, it's probably her. 

Usually there are party committees set up at each level, city/town, county, and state. Find out who sits on these. TALK TO THOSE PEOPLE. Do it POLITELY. they know more about politics than you do. The only politics that matter are local politics and these are the people who control local politics. They know more about the party than you do. They know more people who matter than you do. If that wasn't the case you would be the one the party had chosen to be involved in making decisions. Try to convince these people to support the changes you do.

At all times be very very polite, especially to anyone with any sort of title in government or in the party. Local politics is what controls state politics and both are incredibly petty and feudal. Anytime you want to do anything you are in somebody's fiefdom. You can disagree with them but if you disrespect them they will actively work to stop your efforts out of spite.  

In many parts of the country these committee seats regularly sit open. If yours is empty get your name on the ballot this year, if it's too late do it next year. If you get yourself onto the county or state committees do yourself a favor, show up and shut up for the first couple meetings until you know what's really going on. Who is who. Who is related to who. Who works for who. Once you know that information you're ready to start making the right friends and creating a working group to push for change. 

Real politics, the kind that gets people elected, isn't about ideology. These people want to win elections and have been working and/or volunteering at that for years. Don't debate ideology or philosophy with them. It's about relationships, getting the right people to like you is half the battle. People don't like people who show up at the meeting and denounce the party or the people there as insufficiently democratic or wrongheaded on policy. 

TLDR: show up, find out who really matters, show up, prove your worth by doing the yoeman's work of politics, talk to old people, influence or get on important committees, repeat process once there, then push for your ideas. Always be polite, friendly, and respectful. Look for areas of agreement and personal connections with people.

EDIT: I've never complained about this on reddit before but seriously, I write a primer on how to get involved in politics in the real world, and people down vote it? At least comment on what about this is so bad or offensive. My goal was to help people understand how to actually enact the changes they seem to feel are necessary within the party and people decided to down vote that...

It's not his money. What does he care? 
To add to this.  

There's a couple of articles that explore how the contested convention would play out.

My favorite is this one:

http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/brokering-a-convention/article/2586946

There's another suggesting that Kasich would place Cruz as a Supreme Court nominee 

http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/26/heres-one-way-john-kasich-becomes-the-gop-nominee/#ixzz440lalAxp

Also, the very idea that the party would split if Kasich got the nom is pretty funny especially if you consider a couple of polls that show Kasich has the highest ceiling of any GOP candidate.

(That is republicans willing to vote for him regardless of how they are the nominee)

http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/03/21/new-york-timescbs-poll-74-of-republicans-dont-support-cruz-80-dont-support-kasich/amp/

Because of this, it is very likely that Kasich is more peoples' second choice than not.  This makes him an ideal concession candidate. 

And [republican insiders know it too.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/john-kasich-contested-convention-insiders-220946?cmpid=sf#ixzz43FRuyLnR)

So not only does he have a chance it's a really good chance.

I'm not the one telling people to change their rules but thanks for your glib response that ignored the heart of my comment. I wish I knew enough about politics to be capable of taking two parts of a comment and put them together differently than their writer did then write "lol".  Gee-golly you showed off your valuable contributions to the discussion.

 As I said, it's not my state, Idc what their rules are, and neither should anyone else who doesn't live there. If you do live there and want the rules changed I explained generally how that process works within a party in a separate comment. 
[deleted]
I know I'm probably feeding a troll here, but I'm in the can and have nothing better to do. Do you have any actual criticism of what I wrote beyond that the end result of the events in Colorado hurt a candidate you like?
In response to your edit:

It seems they passed a resolution that would forbid their elected delegates at the national convention from voting for him. I don't know how that makes anything I wrote above or below factually wrong. Once again, state parties set their own rules. If you don't like the rules go get involved; put in some time and effort, bring friends to meetings, and one day maybe, just maybe, you can get the rules changed. Thats how politics works. It may suck but parties have basically unlimited control over how the select candidates. They could literally pass a resolution saying no Colorado delegate can vote without a coors beer within 4 feet of them and that would be the rule. The good news is you can do the same. Just convince people your way is better. I wrote in my first response a pretty much foolproof guide to getting involved in real life politics.
[deleted]
No, this election has exposed how many people think that we're a direct democracy and don't understand what a Republic is and how we elect our leaders. The real conflict here is how the media, especially the Trump shills over at Fox News, has created this perception that voters directly choose the candidate when it has literally never worked that way. The *party* has *always* chosen its nominee. Dwight Eisenhower emerged from a brokered convention for crying out loud. 

I think you mean the power brokers are "hidden in plain sight", since they're literally just the people who've paid close attention to the process the whole time over the course of the last year. How come Trump hadn't gamed this out and is getting crushed in the delegate selection process? Beats me - but this certainly doesn't look like the execution of a master deal-maker.

But this is typical Trumpism....can't figure out how to win the game, so whine about the rules, declare all the other players invalid, and scream **"CHEATER!"**
No, this is not a democracy. It's a *Republic*, and in a *Republic* this is how you choose your leaders. Through a process.
Typical Cruz, can't win a simple majority of a straight-up vote. 
I guess you missed the point about this not being a direct democracy.

Also, we don't elect candidates based on simple majorities so...
As trump fans should know, plurality rules. 
Well. It is. Every delegate went to Cruz without a single CO citizen vote. Does that sound fair to you?
Kasich is such a leech, it's literally impossible for him to win the nominiation, yet he's holding out for a potential brokered convention. The man has ADD and is a complete spaz, they'd never select him in a million years
[deleted]
How is Ted Cruz supposed to "unite the party" when he's afraid of people's votes?
Argument by definition is the linguistic equivalent of throwing your gun at a monster because the *magazine* is empty. You can't justify why denying a plurality of votes is fair or ethnical, so you're left clinging by your fingernails to the one thing left:*It's the rules.*

Americans aren’t rule-followers. It isn’t in our DNA. We are revolutionaries. We are entrepreneurs. Often we are total assholes. But I sure hope we never become a nation of obedient rule-followers.
maybe a strong narrative is to say that public service for the highest office in the land shouldn't be decided by exclusively private clubs 
Are you asking rhetorically? Where did I say that Ted Cruz would do that?

In real terms, he probably can't because he's so roundly despised by his Senate colleagues. 
I don't think this guy knows how it works. If you refuse to follow an administration's policy, they'll find someone who will.
HuffPo? How on earth can you read their inane babble?
&gt; Argument by definition is the linguistic equivalent of throwing your gun at a monster because the magazine is empty. 

Yeah...I read Dilbert too. That sentence is as petty and intellectually weak as "there are lies, damned lies, and statistics". 

You're strawmaning what I'm saying, but fine. You seem to believe that, this time, determining the candidate by direct-vote is wise or "ethical" . I do not. History tells me I'm right. The traditions of Federalism in this country also tell me I'm right. The Founders knew the dangers of direct-democracy, so they designed our system this way and the method by which our parties choose their candidates reflect that design. 

This election cycle is demonstrating exactly why: Trump is a demagogue who is trying to hijack a major political party to continue swindling people. Watching people run through these mental gymnastics trying to explain why he hasn't crushed the delegate process has been downright painful. I thought he was "going to hire the best people"? If he can't deal with a relatively simple delegate selection process, how in the world is he going to manage the country, or deal with Iran, or ISIS, or trade deals, etc. 

But to your point explicitly: denying Trump the nomination despite him (currently) having a plurality of votes/delegates is ethical because *an absolute majority of voters have voted against him*.  That's why we don't choose based on plurality.
And when they run third party, you'll bitch and cry about how a third party candidate is ruining it for everyone. Can't have it both ways, either get your party politics cleaned up or learn to accept third party spoilers because party pols are going the way of the mammoth - whether you like it or not. 

I look forward to the end of the Republicrats, tbh.  
Is this a joke? Why would Obama tell Kasich to get out of the race? 
We shouldn't. Sadly, there is a segment of the population that doesn't know the beauty of craft beer.
No, it didn't. [That's is not what happened at all.](http://ariarmstrong.com/2016/04/setting-the-record-straight-about-colorados-republican-caucus/)


&gt;  The Founders knew the dangers of direct-democracy, so they designed our system this way and the method by which our parties choose their candidates reflect that design.

And how many times have we used this glorious "framework" to save the country from *mean nasty men* like Trump? 

&gt;  denying Trump the nomination despite him (currently) having a plurality of votes/delegates is ethical because an absolute majority of voters have voted against him. That's why we don't choose based on plurality.

That was not my point. My point is that denying him his delegates because of this system is ethically wrong. He should be afforded the proportional representation he is due in any given state, because otherwise we are denying representation to the people who voted for him in their primary/caucus. If we deny votes, we undermine the credibility of our political system in an already precarious time.

No he won't. He'll retreat to the dustbin of history with the Perots and the Anderson's.


BTW let's see Trump bitch about sore loser laws in multiple states. Can't wait.
How exactly was he denied votes in Colorado. He didn't understand their process, and did poorly. How is that at all unethical. Colorado Republicans voted in precinct caucuses for delegates to state conventions, who then voted for delegates to the national convention. Adding another layer to the process does not make it unethical. 
It isn't a private club. Anybody can join. All you have to do is start showing up to your local republican or democratic club meeting. I guarantee they would love to have you, all political people love new comers.
&gt;demagogue 

Cruz is a religious zealot. 

&gt;swindling 

Trump has won every election fair and square. Cruz is using every dirty trick in the book. 

&gt;Mental gymnastics 

You deserve an Olympic gold. Your entire argument hinges on the notion that subverting the will of the people is democratic. 
It's unethical to deny voters their ballot. That's not a complicated idea. 
So let me get this right. The same guy who demanded everyone support him or he won't take the job of the Speaker of the House thinks he can take on Hillary or Bernie Sanders? 
Interesting that Obama wants to split hairs on what's *harmful* disclosure of classified information when the source of the leak is Clinton. He has shown no such appreciation for nuance with regard to Edward Snowden. 
And yet the RNC wants us to vote for another big-government plutocrat. 
Funny you should mention Mr. Call.

He's got a lot of [political sour grapes](http://kdvr.com/2015/03/13/gop-chairman-ryan-call-facing-revolt-led-by-ag-cynthia-coffman/) and a huge chip on his shoulder for the Colorado GOP.
No, my argument hinges on rationally evaluating the context of this election with things like facts and math. He's an example: 37% of GOP Primary/Caucus voters thus far is not "the will of the people". Given that fact, it sure looks like "the will of the people" is pretty clear: not Trump. In fact, when considering how Cruz has done better since Rubio left, it really does look like as the field winnows those voters are tactically voting to stop Trump. I live in California, and know plenty of Republicans who hate Cruz but will be voting/campaigning for him to help ensure Trump doesn't get to 1237. Is that a "dirty trick"? No, that's just representative democracy in action. 

Look, I'm no Cruz fan either and yes he is a religious zealot. But these aren't "dirty tricks". This is how a *representative democracy* works. If Trump shows up to Cleveland without the requisite number of delegates he has no more right to the nomination than someone with zero. Just ask Dwight Eisenhower.
By private I mean not public-- ie, not government.
I've got no issue with the voters selecting a different candidate. Let the voters decide. 

Denying the people of Colorado their day at the polls is dirty. 
[Not what happened](http://ariarmstrong.com/2016/04/setting-the-record-straight-about-colorados-republican-caucus/)
&gt; So if John Kasich cared about anything when it comes to this election except his own ego, he should care about the money that donors have entrusted to him.

LOL. Kasich only cares about his own ego. 
&gt;He should be afforded the proportional representation he is due in any given state, because otherwise we are denying representation to the people who voted for him in their primary/caucus

If you're a fan of proportional representation do you also oppose states the give all the votes to the candidate with the most votes, even if that vote total falls short of a true majority (plurality rules states)? 

If you care so much why didn't you do anything to make the rules more fair in the previous few years? It seems to me a lot of political johnny-come-latelys don't think its fair that other people who have been involved for years understand the process better than they do. 
Excellent article, the writer succinctly explains a simple process. One that was apparently far to complex for political newbies and sad sack supporters to understand.
Our founding fathers never really wanted the common man to make decisions in government. 
Because up until now Johnny-Come-latelys no idea how fucked the political process really was.
I honestly have no sympathy. I'm 24, I started volunteering on campaigns after Soccer practice in middle school, asking my mom if I could go to meetings or she could at least drop me off. I continued it through high school with all my class work, football, and extra curriculars. In college I played ball and got decent grades but was able to knock on 4,000 doors in the fall of 2012, during my senior year, working on an independent study and a full class load because I knew America didn't need 4 more years of this president. I've helped or worked on campaigns in 3 states and continue it while working a full time job and having a part time on the side. My state won't be competitive this fall so I'm going to use my vacation and personal time to go back to my college, stay with friends who live in the area and campaign for the Republican nominee, if I can in good conscience ask people to vote for him.

If I could learn about politics and showing up to meetings at 11 and 12 years old I don't want to hear that people can't understand the rules or don't know how to get involved. There's libraries and newspapers everywhere, cable TV, talk radio, and the internet. The only way people don't know whats going on is that they don't want to know. Willful ignorance isn't really an excuse, its an embarrassment.
Nice hearing from the young-republican outlier. 
Thanks, once the kerfuffle is over, we're all going to need to get to work. Whether its Secretary Clinton or Senator Sanders, getting the American people to reject the candy-shop view of government and divisive identity politics peddled over the last ten years or so by the Democrats will be a tough row to hoe. 
Ari is in bed with Ted. So stop posting stupid links and post actual links.
Doesn't matter to me. I'm just sitting here watching the world go round and round. 
And Hannity, Coulter, and the rest of the shills are in bed with Trump.

Do you have a challenge to his version of events, or do you have a structural challenge that this is how delegates are chosen in Colorado? 
Except the people of Colorado didn't want that shit.  People are fucking burning their voter registrations saying what's the point.  Wait until Colorado decides a god damn vote isn't necessary in the general and casts it's delegates for Clinton, because of a 51% vote in their state legislature authorizing that.  

The party isn't a club make up of some private donors.  The primary process is a FEDERALLY FUNDED ELECTIONS PROCESS.  If it WAS a private club that would be different.  

This flies in the face of democracy and the intent of a truly representative republic
When you actually learn that people are suppose to vote you will learn that colorado didn't get to vote. Stop being a retard.
Forcing him out is even more undemocratic than him staying in. 
If 37% means most voters want "not Trump", then Cruz's even lower numbers mean "not Cruz", right?

Trump may not be getting over half of the votes, but he's getting more than the other candidates. He's the obvious choice if we want "not Hillary".

The problem is that the GOP loses nothing from Hillary winning, they only lose from Trump winning because he can't be controlled, so they're using every dirty tactic they can to prevent that.
George Soros insiders are bankrolling John Kasich's campaign on behalf of 'Soros Management' even though Soros himself isn't directly involved.  This should not change anyone's skepticism of Kasich.   
Well, it would be 63% of voters want "not Trump". That's a pretty healthy majority. Sure, Cruz's numbers are lower. I'm not saying voters are picking him over Trump. I'm noting that voters are so unhappy with their choices it's reasonable that someone else emerges. 

And do people actually think Trump beats Clinton, given his negatives? [Head-to-head he gets crushed.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html)

Completely agree, like it or not, he has a following of people who support him.(However small)
Give him a couple debates against her, he brings things to light, and she's dead in the water. I have very high hopes in a Trump vs. Clinton election. No other candidate stands an honest chance against her.
Somone named "Fuck the Establishment" goes running to Obama to solve his problems. How ironic.
Petition the WH to do what the RNC could do? whaaa?
Legally state legislatures can award electors in the general how ever they want too. The rules aren't complicated. Learn them. If people are so upset by it why weren't they freaking out back in The summer of 2015 when they announced the caucus straw pole would be done away with?

In fact the party is a club made up of private citizens (not donors) and my suspicion is that all this strum und drang is only seen now because people can't handle when the process doesn't go their way. There are at least hundreds of thousands, of not a couple million registered republicans in Colorado. The fact that a few are up in arms isn't surprising, they had the chance to comment on this and maybe even prevent it. Most were probably far too busy with their daily lives. Don't complain now. 
It is a private organization (in that it is not part of the government), they can do what they want. I'm not a Republican so I have no say in how they operate. If you are then you should figure out how you want to respond. I agree that it is not a democratic process, but Republicans need to decide what sort of process they want.
Well we really don't want the government deciding who gets to run.
We are a democracy, the particular kind of democracy is a representative republic.

&gt;, then it's time for us to either force all political parties to operate by a consistent playbook or its time to deny every political party access to public funds to run their corrupt process.

The rules are not corrupt. They are not democratic but that does not make them corrupt. Nor do the parties get much public funding.
This is about the Republican Party picking their candidate. There is nothing about a political party that demands it be democratic. I could imagine say Bloomberg setting up a political party and picking all of the candidates. If he is able to get votes, they get elected. The process to elect people to office is democratic, the process to pick the candidates is what the parties want it to be.


Trump is probably just going to walk around telling people to stay away from the GOP.
&gt; Except the people of Colorado didn't want that shit. People are fucking burning their voter registrations saying what's the point. Wait until Colorado decides a god damn vote isn't necessary in the general and casts it's delegates for Clinton, because of a 51% vote in their state legislature authorizing that. 

How did you go from a party picking a candidate to the general election? Primaries are actually pretty new. Before 1968 they meant nothing at all, state party people or elected officials controlled the delegates and made deals at the convention. How a party picks is independent from how we elect people.

Both parties openly collude to keep third parties down. If any other industry had a duopoly with such open and blatant collusion that went on to gouge and abuse their own customer bases because they can there would be outrage. They may be private organizations but both parties have far too much power over elections to not be regulated.
he's not going anywhere.  K-man is lovin' all the attention, e.g. on TV every day
Could Kasich be playing the long game? Could he have had conversations with Donald? Would Kasich settle for being VP? Trump + Kasich = win on the first ballot. 

Maybe Donald does know how to play the game. 
I think Trump/Kasich is certainly more of a possibility than Trump/Cruz or Trump/Sanders. The big reason for Trump to pick Kasich would be necessity: a need for the delegates at the convention. Kasich could deliver Ohio and help out in Michigan and other states in the area. His "golly gee" working class shtick is a potentially great contrast to Trump's bombast. Kasich's insider experience in Congress would come in useful in a Trump administration. 
[removed]
He has the "highest ceiling" because he hasn't been attacked or smeared yet.

He hasn't been attacked because he's never been a serious contender.

If he does somehow end up with the nomination, he'll start getting more scrutiny and negativity thrown his way and his current "obscurity advantage" will quickly evaporate.
he's been attacked plenty
He's mostly been attacked for staying in an unwinnable race.
The United States is an empire in decline. Universities have always been centers of discovery and truth. During the growth of America, universities unlocked the mysteries of the atom and evolution. They gave voice to serious discussions about economics and political theory. The era of great discoveries and freedom of thought in American (and Canadian and British) universities occurred during the rise and at the apex of American economic and political power. 

But America is now approaching a steepening slope in its decline. As the Roman Empire saw a collapse of intellectual thought concurrent with its political and economic descent, so are America and its satellites showing the effects of the collapse of America's ability to influence global affairs. The psychosis of the young gives testimony to the failure of American culture. 

Empires begin with one people who have a common history, language, culture and religion. They grow, absorbing other cultures along with their religions, customs, values until there is no definable people that populate the empire. There is a polyglot scattering of different peoples, mutually untrusting, mutually uncooperative. This is totally against the imposed new morality of "political correctness", but it is the reality. Read the book ["Bowling Alone"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone)
to see that there is no longer any unity in America. Instead we are applying absurd theories that any 12 year old moron could tell you will be counterproductive. 

America's collapse is imminent and well deserved
Bowling Alone has been on my "list" for a little while. I haven't gotten around to it. I did read a different Robert Putnam book a year or two ago. 
It's a good book, although Putnam doesn't give enough importance to mixed cultures as the driver behind the atomization of Americans
Putnam's a liberal. They're right about some things, especially those who think we need strong civic participation. Trump's bridging the gap. We really do need community. The GOP establishment is right about most things but the stuff they suck on are very damaging to the country. They put the chamber of commerce before the American middle class! 
I am wondering if Kasich isn't already playing that angle. Kasich seems to me to be a genuine, decent man. If so, he can certainly see that Cruz is as conniving a sleaze-ball as you are going to find in DC, the Capitol of sleaze-balls. 

Maybe Donald is not flying blind. Maybe Donald and Kasich are talking. Trump Kasich beats Hillary and it beats Bernie. 
Damn!

I agree with you again....
Kasich seems like an asshole to me but he's of course not anything like Cruz. Kasich hasn't really gotten tangled too much with Trump. Trump/Kasich is a strong ticket. 

Before he tried doing his Don Rickles routine I was thinking Rubio was a possible VP pick. Maybe he still is but he's no longer friendly with Trump. 
Ted Cruz' "strategy": shut up, guys, I'm winning.

Everyone else: scoreboard.
It's *almost* entertaining to see all of the people come out and defend this behavior as if it's somehow acceptable in a first world nation to have tiny groups of people making these decisions without voter input.

How do they not see that it's the same corrupt interests trying to control the election just like they have always done?

It's truly cringeworthy, I'm embarrassed for them. 
Scam site is scammy.  AFAIC, politifact has lost all credibility.  They way they determine, on their own, whose statements to go after and whose to leave alone is just a tool of manipulation.
This problem is not just bad.  It's really bad.  It's tremendously bad and the damage has already been done.  Yet we continue with this economically devastating idea and have put almost no solutions in place.
**A distinction without a difference**. I'll bet you weren't expecting anyone to check your facts, were you? 

Your source links to the statement released by Colorado GOP chair Steve House. Let's go through Steve's explanation of these events. 

 &gt;Some ask why the Colorado GOP doesn't just comply and bind all of our delegates proportionally to the result of a straw poll. There are a number of reasons the executive committee decided against the poll this year and **I won't go into all of them**.

Off to a great start already. *"Because we're cheating the people of Colorado"* is, apparently, too straightforward.

&gt;However, I want to share my most pressing concern with doing a binding preference poll. There is no such thing as a binding preference poll because **when you actually award delegates via a poll it's not a poll - it's an election.** The results **could affect the outcome of the presidential race** because this year the race is **likely to be very close if not unsettled at the national convention**.

There it is, in black and white. *"We will not allow the voters to choose because we want to deliberately obstruct the national convention."* This is the President of the Colorado GOP, speaking *on the record* about his deliberate decision to subvert the will of the electorate. 

Then we get this gem: 

&gt;So what's wrong with an election? **Nothing if you are actually going to run it with all the precautions and security measures of an actual election.** In our case we have over 2000 precincts in 64 counties where there is no uniformity of ballots, no uniform credentialing training process, no clarity on who actually counts ballots, no clear answer to who controls the tally sheets, and no uniform transparent process with integrity in the event there needs to be a recount. **The prospect of awarding delegates through a straw poll with so many systemic loopholes and fraud risks is an unacceptable gamble** given the stakes of this presidential election.

**BOY STEVE** I feel for you there. If only we had some kind of a *state-wide GOP* -- you know, a state-level wing of the Party that could organize elections, and manage the logistical workload. Oh wait, isn't that *your* job, Steve? Isn't that...your *entire* job?

&gt;Picking our delegates through **a controlled and secure four step process** that is open to all registered Republicans **is far preferable than an opaque straw poll.** Something needs to change going forward but election integrity is still more important to me than any other factor.

Blah blah blah; straight-up simple vote elections are somehow more "opaque" in Steve's world than a four-teired Kafkaesque labyrinth of unnecessary delegate rigmarole; and finally we reach Steve's triumphant conclusion "I'm stealing this election and simultaneously referring to my own theft as 'election integrity'".

**WOW.** That is a **LOT** of bullshit, and I think you know it.  
He hasn't been attacked anywhere close to the way the others have been attacked, especially Mr. Trump.

If he somehow walks away from a convention with the nomination, the media will very quickly shift the focus of all of their attacks to Mr. Kasich. Just like with Mr. Trump now, Mr. Kasich will be attacked both fairly and unfairly. He'll be attacked for his record, he'll be attacked for his character, and he'll be attacked for the way he won the nomination.

The fact that his negatives are so low right now is ample proof that he's had very little unfavorable coverage aimed at him. No nominee will avoid the sort of attacks that are routinely thrown at every republican candidate.
yeah right. keep dreaming
The "simple" process of using a four-tiered Kafkaesque labyrinth to circumvent the one-step process of a straw poll? 

Occam's Razor favors a simple election, not convoluted delegate shenanigans. 

And as for this "excellent article", the author links to a source that directly contradicts his statements, and confirms the statements of the critics that this was, in fact, a stolen election. 
Wait. ...Ken?
The God Particle was actually named the God Particle by one particular physicist who didn't believe it existed or would ever be found. He thought it was hogwash. He was an atheist, and so named it... "The God Particle."
Still underestimating him, eh?
No, just estimating him. 
I guess you got a scale of democracy in elections that goes from direct democracy with open primaries on one side to elected delegates on the other side.  I tend to think open primaries are no good and that there should be some hurdles to voting.  I can understand why a party would want to include only invested people in its vote.  Registration seems like a big enough hurdle to me.  I tend to think 30% of people that do vote, probably haven't thought about politics enough and we'd be better without them.  But the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell itself if it seems corrupt.  Although the Democrats are looking much worse right now with the giant Clinton lead.  They are supposed to be the more open party.  But the Republican's seem more open to change and outsiders this cycle.
So, what actually happened, is the Colorado GOP hijacked the election, refused to extend its Constituents their right to vote, and then justified the act by using paper-thin appeals to arbitrary rules. 

The chair of the GOP does not deny that this was a deliberate back-room action taken to steal delegates from Trump -- why do you? 

Because you want Reddit to believe the spin that Cruz' delegate count is legitimate. 

Meanwhile, you throw accusations at *Trump* for "swindling" voters. Keep up the transparent doublespeak. 
You do know the straw poll was called a straw poll because as a straw poll it was non-binding. At no point have Coloradans directly voted on their presidential delegates. The actual selection process did not change one iota. A meaningless symbolic vote was just eliminated. 

&gt;Kafkaesque labyrinth to circumvent the one-step process of a straw poll? 

You mean you show up to a caucus, talk to your neighbors and pick a delegate who thinks like you, then you're done. He repeats the process at a county convention, and person selected there repeats the process at the state convention. That's crazy complex God knows how anyone could figure out that system. You're expected to talk to people and then vote. And you have to vote for someone who knows how to talk to OTHER people. Holy crap. It's almost like someone wants people inside the party to get to know one another and have a dialogue...

If your concern is the use of a caucus system then ok, you prefer primaries. I would prefer people have to discuss as a party before a candidate is selected because I want the eventual choice to be someone people have really thought about, but I see the logic in a primary, it gives the uninvolved, unintelligent, and uninformed power equal to those who actually have sweat equity in the direction the party takes. 
Ah, so you believe it preferable that policy should be hashed out behind closed doors by a shadowy band of usurpers? 

Federalism already grants the government a buffer from these hordes of voting citizens who apparently terrify you. Term limits and bicameral legislation do that trick just fine. 

Elections are the feedback mechanism. That's when the scale tips back in favor of the citizens to self-rule. 

You advocate a Republic of the bureaucracy, by the bureaucracy, for the bureaucracy. Sorry, but those days are over. 

Take your delegates from Colorado. It's still a victory for Trump. Now a million more Republicans have been burned, and they will not stay loyal. 

We are now across the Rubicon. 
&gt; Both parties openly collude to keep third parties down.

That is neither relevant nor important. CA has about 6 parties on the ballot, NY has 6 parties on the ballot. They still get nothing.

&gt;If any other industry had a duopoly with such open and blatant collusion that went on to gouge and abuse their own customer bases because they can there would be outrage.

Read up on [First-past-the-post voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) and [Duverger's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law). Read up on the elections of 1860 and 1912. 


The doors aren't closed. You show up to a caucus. Any republican can go. Once there you vote for a delegate to a county convention and as your duly elected delegate they get to vote for a state delegate. No one is disadvantaged 

 I've seen Gods and Generals too, the sene with Chamberlain quoting Marcus Lucanus "If lawfully you come, if as citizens, this far only is allowed." Is really cool. However, Caesar broke the rules by crossing the Rubicon, a silly little creek, almost like minutia is and always has been how rules and governments function, and is the only way they can. You say you hate bureaucracy all you want. That means you don't understand government, in the real world simple institutions can't govern 300 million people. It's either a nation of rules and laws, or not. If it is than the legal jargon and specific wording is all that matters. If it's not than who cares whether it's a dictator or the mob making decisions.

 I too can cleverly change the words of Lincoln, trump advocates a government of Donald trump, for the bigoted, and by the inexperienced. I'll pass on that.

They aren't my delegates. My candidate lost a long time ago. At this point I'm only opposed to trump because I would like to see the republicans preserve their majorities in the house and senate. See in the world of laws that's where the action happens. If you believe in the constitution, you believe that what's on paper is all that matters. I'm worried president Clinton will allow democrats to take  both chambers of congress and actually pass laws that I am against.
&gt; The chair of the GOP does not deny that this was a deliberate back-room action taken to steal delegates from Trump -- why do you? 

No delegates were stolen from Trump. He simply didn't win. Don't like it? Too bad. It's not like Colorado voters had a primary that Trump won, and then later the state GOP removed his delegates and reallocated them to Cruz. They voted in their precinct caucuses for delegates, and those delegates elected delegates to the national convention. The CO GOP chair openly says that he doesn't like that extra layer of abstraction that exists in their process, and that's fine - but they [changed the rules last summer because they didn't want their delegates pledged to a candidate who didn't end up at the convention.](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28700919/colorado-republicans-cancel-2016-presidential-caucus-vote). Back in August there was some 16-odd candidates running and Trump was still considered to be some sort of bizarre performance art and not the threat he is today. It seems *perfectly* reasonable to want to give your party delegates some leeway in their choice given how crowded the field was. All those Rubio delegates have to waste their votes on the first ballot.

If Trump was such a deal maker, he would have had an apparatus in the state to actually perform in this caucus. But he didn't. Call it arrogance, ineptitude, call it a strategic deployment of resources to focus more on New York...it doesn't matter.

Trump *is* swindling voters. He's doing it on almost every point of his schizophrenic policy platform. My favorite one is making people think starting a trade war with China is a good idea. I saw in /r/The_Donald the other day people saying the trade deficit is $600B (even it was that high, that's only ~3.8% of annual GDP...I'm sure Trump said it at rally...he's got a problem with remembering numbers). He says things that are demonstrably untrue and weirdly people believe them. Many a thesis will be written when this is all over about how easy it is, through social media etc, to trick people into believing things that aren't factual and then reject evidence in front of them as a conspiracy against their guy.

And I despise Cruz.
The next time I need to show someone an example of how to meticulously straw-man someone, I think I'll just point to this comment.

Anyway, you still don't seem to understand that we live in a representative democracy. They made these changes [last year](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_28700919/colorado-republicans-cancel-2016-presidential-caucus-vote) because they didn't want delegates pledged to candidates that didn't last to the convention. Also, have you been to a straw poll? Just curious...

I love reading Trumpkin freakouts about this because it really does show that [he just can't take the heat](http://thefederalist.com/2016/04/11/colorado-proves-donald-trump-cant-handle-the-rigors-of-a-campaign/).
I'm literally quoting the source text. That's a straw man? How? 
No, you're quoting source text and then editorializing it to fit the narrative that you're pushing. 
So basically almost all of /r/conservative and /r/republican.
Not sure how this works out for Ted. His "ground game" is causing the general public to perceive him as the willing beneficiary of an anti-democratic process (regardless of the actual rules of the GOP) and paints Trump as a victim rather than "Giga-Hitler". Cruz's campaign has effectively associated himself with what the public sees as vote suppression and it is tarnishing his brand in the process. Very bad play by Cruz, it only gives Trump's "Lyin' Ted" attacks more weight as time goes on, and it will give his opponents some incendiary ammunition in the general election in event of a nomination.

Worse still is that no one in the party can seem to make up their mind about what their options are for the future. Alarmists say that if Trump wins, it'll bring about catastrophe for the Republican party and damage their hold in congress. With such logic, attempting to outmaneuver Trump via delegate wrangling and a contested convention becomes the strategic option of choice. Yet no one seems to be concerned about how the party's voters will react if Trump is denied the nomination after getting the most votes in the first round at the convention. I'm not sure how the party can survive if a full 1/3 of the base jump ship.

A difficult calculus. 
Trump is no victim. What kind of fools would people have to be to believe that he can be both the best deal-maker around while incessantly whining about not being able to get the support he needs to win? It's not a "bad play" by Cruz, it's smart. It took effort and planning.

If Trump's supporters "jump ship", that is their prerogative, but frankly, I won't much miss 'em.
&gt;  It's not a "bad play" by Cruz, it's smart. It took effort and planning.

And it plays right into accusations that he is duplicitous and deceitful; "Ted can't win an election honestly with a superior number of votes, so he's abusing the rules to win on a technicality". More fuel for the fire of "Shifty Ted", like the Ben Carson boondogle. 

That doesn't play well in the American conscience, regardless of how little the public at large understands the way Primaries actually work. Worse, is that you don't seem to realize how this sort of thing is being spun. You're super defensive. 

&gt; If Trump's supporters "jump ship", that is their prerogative, but frankly, I won't much miss 'em.

You'll miss their votes when they punish the GOP by flipping Congress Blue despite the gerrymandering advantage.
The polls show that Ted was favored in Colorado anyway. He didn't make the CO rules, he just played by them. I suppose you think he should have just stayed away and pouted like the others.
People are allowed to change their minds. Moving on ...
Whoever came up with the term "Twitch hunt" is a genius.
You pretty much described trump. A bigger military libertarian, but too economically conservative to vote democrat. 

People might call this "Populist". 
&gt;I believe in abortion, gay marriage, and at least decriminalization.

With abortion, what are we talking here? General access or full blown 'If it's halfway out the birth canal and they get the machete quick enough it's legal'?

And with gay marriage, 'think it should be legal' or right into 'It should be legal and you should be fined out of existence if you so much as don't want to make a cake for a same-sex wedding even if you serve gay people normally'?
Abortion - Accessible in certain cases. It should be restricted to the time period when the fetus cannot live on its own. 

Gay marriage - Just it should be legal. The second part is stupid. 
You know what's fun? You're actually correct, the GOP in Colorado did not break the rules that the GOP in Colorado invented for itself. 

That will not matter one iota to the one million disenfranchised Republicans of that great state. 

You've hitched your horse to a burning wagon. The second act of this show ends very badly for you. 
Uh huh. So that would be me justifying my position using quotations from the source text as evidence. 

If that's straw-manning, I suppose every research paper ever written is, too. 
My god dude.  I'd personally like to apologize on behalf of conservatives.  The hate on conservative subs lately has gotten to the point where, regardless of obvious well thought comments (with quotations and everything), people's only response is to hate on you and misquote you to the point where it paints you to be the boogie man.  Keep preaching brother,  the conservatives aren't all blinded with hate yet.
Things have polarized hard. By this point the dialogue feels more akin to the Protestant reformation, with the disenfranchised voicing their grievances while the faithful shout *"HERETIC"*.
Absolutely, the horrible thing is that retaliation in any way that can be viewed as abrupt and crude will get you banned in a heartbeat because the attitude used against you in question has become the norm.  While the people making baseless accusations against you, and calling you names and such will continue posting freely because they are now in the majority.
Alright! I'm not sure of the kind of republican you are - I guess you'd be classified as a 'basic common sense' conservative. Maybe a merit-conservative? Your emphasis seems to be based on self-reliance, achievement, and general political non-involvement.
Generally speaking, research papers make a claim and then back up that claim with evidence.

Here's an example:

Claim: Trump is really disliked by voters

Evidence: [Trump is really disliked by voters](http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/188177/trump-image-among-democrats-independents-negative-gop-candidate.aspx)

You claim "cheating", but then do not supply any evidence. Instead, you take the quotes from the source text and re-frame them to fit what you think is cheating, and then declare the resulting delegate allocation invalid. 

Evidence would be, say, Trump won delegates and then the Colorado GOP took them away (somehow). Or they were somehow able to identify Trump supporters before they voted in their precinct caucuses for their state delegates and then denied them the right to vote. None of that happened. Trump simply didn't do well and the Trumpkins can't figure out why.

LAME

SAD
Okay, I didn't realize I was talking to a learned doctor. 

PREMISE: The chair of the Colorado GOP deliberately circumvented a binding straw poll, because the chair of the Colorado GOP wanted to subvert the will of the electorate. 

SUPPORT: See above. 

Again, Steve does not deny that this action was a deliberate one, nor that it was intended to disrupt "a close convention". His justification for why a binding straw poll would have been impossible are all logistical entanglements under his own direct control as chair of the Colorado GOP. 

QED, the Colorado GOP deliberately broke the Colorado election so that they could fall back on an undemocratic delegate-swap with the explicit intention of robbing Donald Trump of the nomination. 

See also Fig. 12: the GOP tweet "We did it #NeverTrump" 
What a cuck. He shoulda stood up to the SJWs! Sad. I mean what he was wrong but so what. The chilling effects on free speech caused by these people is becoming the death of American intellectual discourse.
Again, you have no evidence that he "wanted to subvert the will of the electorate." You're interpreting a rule change, from last summer, as part of a grand conspiracy. The Denver Post has him quoted about how they didn't want Delegates to be bound to candidates not still in the race by June. Certainly seems reasonable to me. And another thing, caucuses have been part of our candidate selection process for a reason...they force Citizens to actually interact with each other (though I can understand why one would choose to pass on interacting in person with a Trump supporter) whereas a straight poll doesn't. Are you suggesting that Trump does better in election contests where his supporters do not have to defend his ideas to others before a vote? That's an interesting hypothesis...seeing as how he's done worse in Caucus states, there's some evidence for it!

&gt;...with the explicit intention of robbing Donald Trump of the nomination. 

Taking your contention at face value, which I do not, they made the change back in August. How could the change possibly be targeted at Trump? And another thing, if Trump cannot figure out the intricacies of representative democracy, how can be possibly figure out a trade deal?

And it's interesting you cite a tweet as evidence, given how Trump seems to have *zero* self control in that matter. Trumpkins everywhere make excuses for what he tweets. That or they just secretly agree with it all.
So, the Denver Post claims that Colorado was concerned about delegates being committed to a mathematically eliminated candidate in *April*? Interesting, I thought the 8-state rule of 2012 was supposed to fix that very problem. 

Keep lobbing em over the plate. I'll keep hitting em out of the park. 
I'd rather burn up with someone I can respect than succeed with someone I can't. As I said, my candidate left the race early, Scott Walker was first the guy I wanted . He got no traction and had the of sense to leave early. I then was willing to support Rubio because he would have easily beat Clinton or Bernie. He blew it with his Marco the robot routine. At this point I don't care if it's Kasich or Cruz,  both have solid records and are good men. I've given my fall to republican candidates at all levels for nearly a decade now, and I'd be happy to ask people to vote for either of those people in the time I'm not at work.

 I wouldn't presume to tell you who to support, but at least as many republicans won't vote for trump in a general election as trump supporters won't vote for Cruz or Kasich. I vote for the candidate of the best character I can find with policies I can tolerate and who I think can beat the democrats. The second two qualifications are binary. Can I support their policies (yes or no)? Do they have a real chance to win ceteris paribus (yes or no)? Then of the candidates who I can answer yes to both I select the person of the best character. 
You quite clearly just don't understand how any of this works and don't seem to want to either.
They do plan these things quite far in advance, so yes it is reasonable that the Colorado GOP could conceivably want to allow their delegates to vote for whoever, and they could have been thinking that thought back in August when they planned their caucuses for April.

And the 8-state rule was a rule in 2012...it hasn't been voted on yet for this convention. I know Sean Hannity keeps bringing it up, but it's entirely possible that it won't be a thing this year. *That's how this works. The party gets to make the rules. And the state party gets to make their rules for electing their delegates.*

You can go back to /r/The_Donald now.

So, for your scenario to be accurate, the Colorado GOP would have had to, last August, have deemed it more likely that a contested convention would occur than that a brand new GOP rule would be instantly repealed. 

Unless you're telling me that all of these GOP rules are simply made up on the spot to serve the agenda of the party elite, at the expense of the will of the voters - - in which case it sounds like we agree. 

Another fat fastball. You ever gonna show us a curve?

Well, that's what they said when they changed the rule back in August. I believe I've already cited you the Denver Post article saying as much. So yes, they thought it likely or at least possible that we'd have the first contested GOP convention in a generation given how many people were in the race. There's nothing unreasonable about that.

And stop strawmaning. That seems to be the MO of people from /r/The_Donald. The rules are made by the party. The delegates who ran are regular people who paid attention and were active in politics. Stop whining about Trump being a Johnny-come-lately to the process here. I'm still waiting for you to address how Trump is going to handle things, like governing or ISIS, that are enormously more complicated than a boring caucus in Colorado where he can't even figure out the rules before playing the game.
"Red state economies based on energy extraction, agriculture and suburban sprawl may have lower wages, higher poverty rates and lower levels of education on average than those of blue states — but their residents also benefit from much lower costs of living. For a middle-class person , the American dream of a big house with a backyard and a couple of cars is much more achievable in low-tax Arizona than in deep-blue Massachusetts."

Yeah, i guess if you discount wages, poverty and education and just look at how many snickers bars people can buy the whole equation changes. #Republicanlogic

You described libertarianism. Libertarians prefer to maximize personal freedom in most subjects, but also personal accountability. We understand the need for government but want it to be restricted in power and scope and held accountable for how that power is used.

I'm a libertarian who tends to vote Republican. I believe that individuals should not initiate aggression against others. "Aggression" being the use of force or fraud to violate the sovereign rights of an individual's' life, liberty, or property. (Self defense doesn't count as aggression.)

I'm also a nationalist and believe that nations should apply those same principles in how they manage themselves and interact with each other. Entangling alliances should be avoided, and war should be avoided whenever possible(but fought ruthlessly once joined, to be decisively won as quickly as possible.)
Electability:

Republicans aren't going to win by arguing ideology, they will win by putting forward a candidate who makes Hilary look old and infirm. Just as her husband did to Bob Dole and the current president did to McCain. Trump is also in his 60s, he's not going to be able to make that argument. He also will drive up democratic turnout. Look at polling, [Trump v Clinton](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html)
[Cruz v clinton](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_cruz_vs_clinton-4034.html)
[Kasich v Clinton](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_kasich_vs_clinton-5162.html)

If those numbers hold, Trump would lose the election, republicans would lose the senate, likely the house, and it would be repeat of 1964. Cruz would lose, the senate would end up very close, likely with a democratic VP as the deciding vote, and republicans would probably hold the house. Kasich would win the election, republicans would hold both the senate and house. (I'm assuming that there won't be any major shakeup a in specific states and districts. We both know there will be over the next few months but there's no way to know who they will help or hurt. So right now I am pretty sure Kasich can win, and since Cruz is within the margin of error in most polls I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he could run a good enough campaign to make up a couple percentage points, especially since most Americans haven't really seen that much from him. 

Trump and Hillary have virtually 100% name recognition and voters know exactly what their issues and stances are, neither is likely to make much headway against the other. Even if trump ran an amazing campaign, I don't think he, or anyone else, could make up a double digit difference in their numbers when there are no new facts to show the voters. If Hilary were indicted that would change everything, but if that happens then any republican would likely win, meaning that electability would no longer matter.

Policy wise: 

I hated his comments on NATO. I don't care if they were uttered accidentally or taken out of context. The global security apparatus set up during and after the Cold War has created the longest era of peace between major nations since the early/mid 1800s no responsible leader would risk messing with that. When he didn't know what the nuclear triad was it was embarrassing to the entire party, that's on the APUS test I took in 10th grade, no excuse not to know that. I also don't like his stance on China. 

Arguing about bilateral trade imbalances in a globalized world is silly. Unless you reject capitalism entirely (which he obviously doesn't) you know that trade is not a zero sum game. All parties benefit from free trade. Perhaps China benefits more, but imposing tariffs was what turned the 1929 crash from a major correction into the Great Depression. Trade ceases, deflation sets in and markets die. Even if that drastic and unlikely outcome doesn't happen, tariffs don't punish the Chinese. They punish American consumers. Sure a few Americans get manufacturing jobs again, that's great for them, meanwhile after Rubbermaid moves back to northeast Ohio the $10 garbage can I wanted to buy now costs  the original cost, plus the tariff because they know they don't have to worry about anyone undercutting their prices from overseas. So some guy gets a new job and I get to pay more for all my household products. That's a bad deal for me.

When it comes to character: 

I dislike the man. He is egotistical, brash, and offensive. He is a bully, he insults people in public, and he leverages his wealth and power to help himself and his businesses with no concern for the people he is hurting. Now there is no rule that a businessman has to care about anything except making money and I applaud his success in that field. But as president I want someone who is more than just competent at running an organization. I want somebody who cares about how their policies effect real people. I also find his preoccupation with winning to be unsettling. Geopolitics is not a sporting event. Sometimes you can't win. Sometimes you have to allow yourself to lose rather than continue with a failed policy. Lastly, I don't believe he is a Christian. I don't care if the president is an atheist, satanist, Buddhist, Muslim, jew... But I want to know what they believe. Nothing in his life until he started running for president had even a tinge of Christianity to it, then he claims his favorite book is the bible. Hoodwinking people over an issue as important as faith/value systems is not something I think good people do (even in politics there are limits).
You seem to think that's a very clever point, since you've brought it up several times. It's really not; it's another fat fastball down the middle. 

If you're right, and Trump has lousy organizational skills, then Cruz' *20 losses* are even more embarrassing. This guy can't win elections even against an "incompetent" political rookie?

But of course, that isn't what's going on at all.

By your own admission, the Party changes the rules and moves the goal posts completely at random and without regard to law or decency or even common sense. 

When you play against a cheater, and the cheater wins, did they really? Did you really lose? 

See, the rule of law is nothing at all like the primaries. The primaries are like playing cards against a five year old. They don't follow any coherent set of rational rules, and they'll just arbitrarily claim victories they haven't earned. 

Running a country is completely different. Laws actually do matter, and don't change with the breeze. 

Negotiating with foreign nations, same deal. Treaties are set in stone. You negotiate it, you put it in writing, and it's done. Governance happens in the adult world, where rules are binding. 

If anything, Cruz is *less* qualified to play at that table than Trump. Trump plays straight and wins honorably. Leaders foreign and domestic know that his word is his bond. 
Oh good to know that Trump believes in the rule of law now. When did that change? During the Town Hall? Countries move the goal posts *all the time* when negotiating deals. 

But this is golden:
&gt; Governance happens in the adult world, where rules are binding. 

And who's been the *least* adult-like candidate to ever run for president? Who's been running around saying he'd do things that are constitutionally or legally impossible? Who's been running around showing the world that he doesn't have the faintest clue about how Congress passes laws, or what rule the Executive plays, or how the Supreme Court works? Who's been talking about vague notions of "winning" with trade, and has tricked people into thinking a trade deficit is tantamount to theft? This whole farce has been a signal for how awful our civics economics classes must be in this country, otherwise people would hear what he says and immediately dismiss it.

&gt; Trump plays straight and wins honorably.

Tell that to the victims of Trump U.
Alright now, let's calm down. You've just made some spurious accusations. 

I'll ignore the baseless character assaults, since they are just that, but I do want some clarification on one point. 

Which of Trump's policy proposals do you think are unconstitutional? 
Would love to hear the actual mods comment on this. Be very sad to see this sub follow the way of the libs and go anti-free speech, but maybe there's a rational explanation they can offer.
&gt; I'll ignore the baseless character assaults, since they are just that...

On a near daily basis Trump sullies the race to some pissing contest with actual character assaults. My pointing this out doesn't qualify.

&gt; Which of Trump's policy proposals do you think are unconstitutional? 

To start, banning "Muslims" from immigrating. My other favorite is "opening up the libel laws" when NYT or whoever writes something that he doesn't like. Both are an assault on the First Amendment. Neither of which have any real possibility of happening (because of separation of powers, thank god) but both proposals shed real light on the character of the man.
... Neither of those examples are remotely unconstitutional. 
  
Since we're taking about the Constitution... here's what Thomas Jefferson has to say on the subject:

*"Is rapid population growth by a great importation of foreigners founded in good policy?*
  
*They will bring with them the principles of the governments they leave, imbibed in their early youth; or, if able to throw them off, it will be in exchange for an unbounded licentiousness, passing, as is usual, from one extreme to another. It would be a miracle were they to stop precisely at the point of temperate liberty.*

*These principles, with their language, they will transmit to their children. In proportion to their number, they will share with us the legislation. They will infuse into it their spirit, warp and bias its direction, and render it a heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass."* 

--Thomas Jefferson: *Notes on Virginia*

Not satisfied? Fair enough. The real arbiter of what is or is not Constitutional is the Supreme Court of the United States, which has consistently upheld federal limits placed on immigration for over a century. 

In fact, SCOTUS ruled as recently as 2012, in *Arizona v. United States*:
  
*"The Government of the Unit­ed States has broad, undoubted power over the subject of immi­gration and the status of aliens. … This authority rests, in part, on the National Government’s con­stitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and its inherent power as sovereign to control and conduct relations with foreign nations."*

And as for libel - - Trump simply wants to reconcile the confusion regarding defamation *per se* that has been left an open question since the *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan* ruling in 1964. 

What else you got? 

#THIS ONE'S HEADED FOR THE UPPER DECKS! IT'S GOING...GOING...*GONE*!!!
&gt; The real arbiter of what is or is not Constitutional is the Supreme Court of the United States, which has consistently upheld federal limits placed on immigration for over a century. 

Good ole Tommy J. One of my favorites. You do realize he argued that the United States had an obligation to provide asylum in the same document, right. I'm guessing no, and that you haven't actually read Notes on Virginia.

Not once has the court upheld a test based on religion. Not once. I'm going to guess you haven't actually read the entire opinion of Arizona v. United States. If you had, you'd realize that the case simply affirmed the Federal Government's primacy in making immigration law, not that they can make religious tests for entering the country - that wasn't the question at issue.  There is no controlling precedent for that anywhere. The irony here is that pro-strict immigration folks were *upset* about that ruling because it meant that the stricter immigration rule, involving immigrant identification, that Arizona had passed was invalid. The fact that you cited *that* particular case to justify your logic means to me you don't have a grounding in Supreme Court Jurisprudence. Go hang out on /r/SCOTUS for a bit please, and test out those arguments there. You probably pulled that down from your Trumpkin talking points but nice try. Current law, including the Hart-Cellar immigration act of 1965, excludes the use of religion as a test for granting immigrants entry. Beyond this idea being unconstitutional and illegal, there's a subtle tinge of racism and xenophobia that's all too apparent with the Trump camp. I see it all the time on /r/The_Donald. It's painfully obvious.

As for NYT v. Sullivan...how in the world do you consider that an open question? Have you even read the opinion? This sounds like further rationalization of Trumper demagoguery. Not once have I heard Trump mention the controlling case here...he just yells and moans about the press writing things he doesn't like - points to the back "oh the press...they're terrible people!" What a chilling of free speech it would be to make it legal for public officials to threaten the press for writing an OpEd they don't like because in their warped version of reality what was said was false. Trump fans complain about Obama's overreach all the time - do you wish that he had that power to sue Fox News every time they said something he disagreed with?  Btw, NYT v. Sullivan was 9-0. This is the same court (the Warren Court) that passed other landmark civil rights decisions. Good luck trying to re-litigate that. There's a reason that in 51 years there's been no challenge.

Edit: Had to look it up in my notes, but here you go.
&gt; "It [has] been the wise policy of these states to extend the protection of their laws to all those who should settle among them of whatever nation or religion they might be and to admit them to a participation of the benefits of civil and religious freedom, and... the benevolence of this practice as well as its salutary effects [has] rendered it worthy of being continued in future times." --Thomas Jefferson: Proclamation, 1781. Papers 4:505


Aha! I did know that, but I didn't know that *you* knew that. Change-up, I like it. 

So now we're in the weeds. You're right, SCOTUS has never ruled that religious affiliation is a qualifying condition for immigration (or anything else, for that matter). But, circumvented easily enough. Close the borders to all Middle Eastern nations and their citizens. Perfectly Constitutional, and nearly as effective. 

We can agree to disagree on libel, but let's be honest - - Congress is not going to pass a bill on that. It's political posturing. 
Close the borders, huh. Gee. That sounds like a recipe for making everyone hate us. Beacon of freedom to the world be damned, I guess.

You can argue about the particularities of the policy for accepting migrants and asylum seekers, but the law is clear that you can't ban them based on religion. So why keep saying it? As far as closing the borders to the Middle East...what do we say to, for example, Jordan who has taken a lead role in fighting ISIS? Too bad, you have too many Muslims? What about Iraq or Afghanistan, where interpreters who worked for the US Military desperately want to leave for fear of retribution from ISIS or the Taliban, respectively? What about the Christian populations in those countries, desperate to escape persecution by Islamists? It's a policy rooted in absurdity and is entirely unenforceable, and it would have to be done through, again, Congress. 

And are you admitting that Trump talking a big game about libel really is just a game?

Huffpost is garbage. They shouldn't be getting clicks from us.
&gt; So I have always identified as independent

literally "independent"?  that you actually agree/agreed with a basket of liberal policies?
You sound like a libertarian Republican. There are plenty of people out there like you. For example:

http://rlc.org/frequently-asked-questions

&gt;What is the RLC’s position on abortion?

&gt;Our official position is neutral. RLC members hold both pro-life and pro-choice views on the issue, as well as those who are “in between.”
Border control has been a staple conservative policy for decades. If Scott Walker was up there promising to build the wall, you'd be shouting yee-haw.

Dubya had it right: we're at war with radical Islam. They slaughtered our civilians in an unprovoked assault upon our homeland. What more proof do you need? The Empire of Japan did less damage, and we nuked them twice.

Don't think we ought to close the borders? Ask Europe how their open-door policy is going. Killing sprees in Paris. Mass rapes in Sweden. Subway bombings in Brussels. 

**WAKE UP, SOLDIER!** This is not a drill. It's time to Shut. It. Down.

Earlier you mentioned that global trade is not a zero-sum game. I believe your exact words were "free trade benefits everyone". Tell that to the 50 million Americans unemployed or underemployed. Tell that to the graduating college seniors who have student loan debt and no prospects. Explain to them why it's a good thing that their job went to China.

We started out talking about Colorado. You said that Cruz deserves those stolen delegates, and that we ought to question Trump's leadership for letting it happen.

Riddle me this: if Trump is running an incompetent campaign, why has he beaten Cruz in 20 contests? If what you say is true -- if Trump is incompetent -- how are we to evaluate the candidate that loses to that incompetence again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again?

In case you're counting, that's **FOUR RUNS** scored off of that fatty.
  
 **GRAND SLAM**

1) No, I would not be shouting yee-haw because I'm not an idiot.

2) [Bush said the opposite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKacGTJ6-W4).

3) They attacked us yes. I've deployed to Afghanistan as an Infantryman. And I can tell you that ill-formed and simplistic policies, like those Trump pushes and supported by the ill-informed (omg the heads! we must be allowed to torture!) lead to *disaster* on the ground. The kind of (lack of)policy he pushes would literally create the terrorists we're trying to kill. Are you talking about widespread genocide? (idk, maybe you are...it's hard to tell). It's extremely troubling, from a moral-ethical perspective at a minimum, that all these people see to have forgotten all the things that actually make America great. Things like respect for our values as a country...things like human rights. Swore an oath to defend those things, because I believe in them. You should really believe it when Michael Hayden says [the military would disobey Trump if he said "kill the families of terrorists."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/28/former-cia-director-military-may-refuse-to-follow-trumps-orders-if-he-becomes-president/) I know I would. I guess I'll stop because I feel like an appeal to morals is going to be lost on you and you'll probably respond with "you're a pussy" or something else equally juvenile and lacking in any philosophical grounding. 

4) **I was an actual soldier** and I can assure you I am awake to the threat Trump and his followers represent to our Republic. I'm doing everything I can to stop him. 

5) I didn't say that about trade explicitly, and that quote wasn't from me, but it's fine you interpreted what I said as such. I believe I said something like "Trump has tricked people into thinking a trade war with China is a good idea." I stand by that for a few reasons. The first is that Trump has managed to make people think that a trade deficit is categorically a bad thing. It isn't, and you'd learn that in a 100 level economics class. Trump, apparently, went to Wharton. Weird. Second, magnitude matters. I've seen people and heard Trump yell about a "$500B trade deficit! It's terrible! We don't win!". Our trade deficit with China for 2015 was [$366B.](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html) For a relative comparison the GDP of the state of California in 2015 was [$2.4T.](http://www.bea.gov/iTable/drilldown.cfm?reqid=70&amp;stepnum=11&amp;AreaTypeKeyGdp=5&amp;GeoFipsGdp=XX&amp;ClassKeyGdp=NAICS&amp;ComponentKey=200&amp;IndustryKey=1&amp;YearGdp=2015Q2&amp;YearGdpBegin=-1&amp;YearGdpEnd=-1&amp;UnitOfMeasureKeyGdp=Levels&amp;RankKeyGdp=1&amp;Drill=1&amp;nRange=5) The closest state to $366B last year was Maryland...so we bought roughly one "Maryland" of trade goods from China last year. Winning on trade has to do with more than just the dollar value of the goods and services traded between the two nations. Back to my point on magnitude, our total trade deficit, which includes all trade with foreign nations, from 2011-2015 is on average just [2.2% of GDP.](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BN.CAB.XOKA.GD.ZS) Trump acts like a trade deficit is like stolen cash and it isn't. I really don't feel like running a whole class on trade economics, but I will say this: when Trump says that he's "going to bring back the manufacturing jobs lost over the last 25/30 years", which I've heard him say, he's being horribly intellectually disingenuous. Technology destroyed most of those jobs, not trade, and technology will continue destroying jobs. That's what technology does. It makes things easier. The computer killed the typewriter. The automobile killed the carriage maker. Digital killed film. The robot killed the factory worker. On and on it goes. I've gotten to tour a Toyota plant in Japan and it's an absolute fucking technological marvel - but it sure did kill a lot of jobs when they brought those ideas here. There are specific complaints about companies engaging in deliberately dishonest business decisions (like corporate inversions) that we absolutely need to address (assuming you agree with that...it's really hard to tell...I could see Trump being fine with corporate inversions because "it's good business!"). Those decisions do kill jobs, and those particularities should be addressed. Finally, trade wars *are* bad...because everyone loses - and a trade war would likely precipitate a global recession. Now, I can go into the particularities of currency manipulation and the bilateral relationship China has with US Treasuries if you like. But that's enough of an economics lesson.

6) More to your point, the college graduate job didn't go to China. China took manufacturing jobs that were either too expensive or dangerous to do here stateside. Cost is the primary driver for movement abroad. Does Trump want to lower the corporate tax rate? How about get rid of labor safety standards in the work place? Dismantle unions? Who knows - again lack of detail and all we get is "we're gonna bring the jobs back". If college students have awful student loan debt and can't pay it back then should I have sympathy for the student who majored in pottery and fucked off for 4 years? (LAME. LOSER. Insert-Trump-word-here) Are you taking Sanders' position that public university should be free?

7) Yes he has beaten Cruz in 20 states! Cruz is an asshole, despised by the GOP for shutting down the government, probably costing them house seats, and being an all-around jerk. But Trump has still only gotten 37% of the total votes cast. It remains clear that a majority of voters do_not_want_Trump. Trump's success is likely due to how wide the field was early on, and then coalesced as he built his rhetoric on voter anger and resentment. That's okay. But let's channel it in actual policy suggestions, not bullshit.

I can go on, and on, and on with the lessons in economics, law, even statistics if you like. I guess the overall point I'm trying to make is that Trump is nothing but a surface level swindler. His policies are ankle deep, and mostly wrong, illegal, or not structurally possible. As you admitted when we went over the religious tests for immigration and libel law, what he says isn't possible. So...here we are. 

Jesus, stop with the baseball metaphors. It makes it sound like you're arguing with yourself.
My concerns rise from a Michael Burry (The Big Short) speech.  I linked a clip but I would suggest watching the entire speech, Burry is insightful and a good speaker.  

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CLhqjOzoyE&amp;t=10m33s

Edit:
I think the education bubble is due to the fact that its super easy to get a college loan from the government.  The education bubble is related to some of Burry's main points but not discussed specifically. 
Uh oh! Here comes ze establishment!
I would have no issue at all if the vote would rightfully go to the person with the most votes, or even 50%+1 of the delegates of the REMAINING candidates. It's ridiculous when it's 50%+1 of 17 people, or else it's decided by a few hundred people instead of millions and millions of voters.
Damn bro I read this whole conversation you deserve a standing ovation 
i don't think its a bubble
trading in a loser for a winner?
Here's the thing, they fought tooth and nail because they thought Trump was a bumbling idiot. But it was because Trump never really all in in the presidential race until he met Jeb Bush who after gauging him, realize that he has much better prospect to get the nomination while Jeb was THE pick.

  Now people who were against Trump mostly because they though Trump was an idiot started to think that Trump is competent after all. They are much easier to sway; How can they believe Trump is an idiot in the first place logically if they were not so snobby with sticks so far up their asses. He's a self made billionaire after all, and he run business after business brilliantly in New York where it's a must to rub shoulders or attacking politicians and other brokers to get what you need. Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Donald Trump doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing.

Libertarian. You might want to stop by /r/KasichForPresident. Rand Paul is one of the more prominent members of this wing of the party, and a large portion of his supporters turned to Kasich when he dropped out, seeing him as a common-sense fiscal conservative.
Google Warren G. Harding.
It's actually been really enlightening to me to tease out the cognitive dissonance in Trump supporters and figure out the roots of *why* they believe things that are factually inaccurate.
Ok, thats cool.
You realize that Kasich is the type of politician that if you know him more, you'll like him more. Look at Ohio. A divided state. A swing state. But also a state that knows Kasich the best. Kasich beats Clinton by 21 points in the latest poll. 

If Kasich is the nominee, his numbers will only improve from where he is, and where he is is pretty damn good already. 
Why encourage the best candidate to win the fall to drop out of the race? Republicans, please don't eff this up. 
Back page news for everyone. But when he was charged you couldn't get away from the news.
You need to find a niche without a voice (ie your base) that is ready for a grassroots movement. You need to organize them in a very good and constructive way so that it highlights what difference can be made if there is more support. 

It needs to be edgy and community focused. With this case study/example, you need to find new donors that like to bet on the underdog - the come back kid. 

You need to sell more than, "hey, we're conservative, please support us". Sell the change you want to make happen. And make sure it's exciting and you are excited! 

An example off the top of my head - the Congressional candidate should have the personal touch of rescuing farmers in your area from Monsanto, etc. Or sponsoring a bill that would benefit the whole community in some way. 

You need to make them into a hero so that the donors will feel like they are changing the world with their contributions. 
Unfortunately the donors are pretty much right. I care about the congressional republican primary in my district, but I don't see any reason the incumbent won't win 80%-20%. 

One tactic I recall seeing in Maryland is to just run as a libertarian. If the area is liberal, running as very very anti-war could be effective, particularly if you take some Trump positions (don't call them Trump positions obviously) and say you want a strong DEFENSE not a strong offense a la Clinton and most incumbent democrats. 
And he's ***still*** having trouble!
Uh huh. So, when I mention the Supreme Court you're a legal scholar. When I mention Jefferson you're a historian. I mention the War on Terror and you're a veteran of Afghanistan. When I talk about trade imbalance; what are the odds! You're an economics professor.

You're quite the Renaissance Man. With such an impressive resume, why aren't *you* running for President?

Seems to me more likely that you're none of those things. Maybe you're just another Reddit shill eeking out a living by spreading lies and hoping folks don't put it together. 

You shroud yourself in many claimed accomplishments, and yet you cannot answer one simple question. Why do the people of Colorado not deserve their opportunity to vote their conscience?

Bloop double. Unforced error; defense overplayed.

If Trump ends up winning this election outright, I want to see him thank Cruz by name when he's on stage in Cleveland.

And that name should be 'Raphael'.
**HIGH ENERGY**
============
Perhaps I'm a former infantry officer who studied economics and law as an undergrad who's now getting a graduate degree. Veterans like us do exist (there's a lot of us actually), and it's sort of annoying that Trumpers always react this way. 

We already addressed Colorado, and the question at hand was not whether the voters deserve to vote their conscience, of course they do. The question was whether Cruz "cheated". I argue he did not, and I presented evidence as such. You argued he did and presented no evidence (fraud, stolen ballots, etc) other than complaints about the rules. Is Colorado's *system* the best? Probably not - it's confusing and complicated. But that isn't the question. Thus far, [the system has actually favored Trump.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-right-that-the-gop-primary-is-unfair-it-favors-him/) So I hope Trump will do the right thing for the voters and give back those delegates from winner-take-all-states proportionally based on vote totals, no? You're quite dense if you don't see the irony there.

One observation:
The Trumpkin in his natural habitat is unable to address an argument on its merits. They are functionally incapable of objectively evaluating evidence, reading, or doing math. They also revert to the prototypical ad hominem attack, where when they run into evidence counter to their worldview they then attack the person as a "shill" and imply they must be being paid to say these things - ignoring the more likely reality that *some people just don't like Trump and what he stands for.* It's a Stalinist tactic, which makes sense given the similarities exhibited by Donald Trump to strong-men throughout history.

Just set a record for triple-doubles in a season, and the season's just getting started.

Edit: You do realize that if one studies the Court there's a strong chance that they've read some Jefferson, among others, right. 
Cruz won't stop pounding Trump even though Cruz is running in *LAST place** throughout the Northeast.  I don't get it
Cruz platform has always been to go against the grain. He secretly wishes he was Trump.
We will lose the District of Columbia in the general election.  I do not see Trump putting in the effort necessary to win Hawaii.  With the other 49, Trump has as good a shot as any candidate since Reagan vs. Mondale.
does Cruz covet Melania ???
I've always wondered why it's Raphael?  What is that from?
By your own logic, the more voters know Trump the more they will like him. Kasich only got 46.8% of the vote in Ohio but Trump is polling at 54-60% in New York.

But it's faulty logic. **Every** candidate is expected to win their home state by a healthy margin. Winning his own state is not noteworthy, it would only have been if he had lost.

The polls that match Kasich against Clinton are putting a relatively unknown person against a person with very high negatives. If Kasich did somehow steal the nomination, the media would spend the next few months talking about him and they would treat him just as unfairly as every other republican candidate is treated.
His number was literally exactly true, yet it's still marked as only partially. Polifact is pathetic. 
their reasoning for the markdown is a valid concern but yeah its a still a news media article talking about a conservative... its par for the course.
You forgot the part where I said KASICH is the type of politician that will be well liked, NOT trump. Watch is town hall from time to time and you'll understand. I recommend the CNN Kasich Family town hall.
Yes for the primary. General election might be tough. I foresee him winning New York in the general, but it'll probably be a pretty close margin, especially if he's running against Clinton.
You think he can grab NY in the general ? That would repaint the electoral picture completely.
It will be close, but I think he can. He's a pretty big name in NYC.
Obama took 2/3rds of the votes in NY.

While maybe Trump has the best chance of making the impossible happen, it's still not going to happen. No Republican is winning a single electoral vote in NY in the general election.
What if his opponent is in a federal jail?
You are saying that the fact that Kasich won Ohio means that people who are more familiar with him are more likely to support him. I am saying that, if this is true for Kasich who won 46.8% of the vote in Ohio, it is also true for Trump who is expected to win over 50% of the vote in New York.

You can't have it both ways. Your own standard favors Mr. Trump more than it does Kasich.

Kasich has escaped serious scrutiny so far because he is irrelevant. He is currently #4 in a race that has three candidates running. His only purpose for even remaining in the race is to deny delegates to other candidates. He won't even be able to have his name put forward for nomination unless he miraculously wins delegate majorities in another seven states.
Romney or McCain vs Obama isn't going to do anything in Liberal states. Trump can actually beat Hillary or Sanders in liberal states.
Honestly the only way I see it happening is Trump v Clinton, with Clinton being indicted.
Only if the libtards are ready to stop being cucked. 
Remind me! November 9, 2016 "that [this clown](https://www.reddit.com/user/poppymelt) predicted Donald Trump will win NY."
I'm sure NY will find someone besides a Republican to vote for.
My understanding is that Raphael is Ted's real first name, he just goes by Ted because that's a more electable name in his view.
Noo, that's not what I'm saying. It's a given Kasich HAD to win his own state. He would be a loser if he didn't. I'm talking about the general election match-up (the more important one). Kasich beats Clinton by 21 points while Trump loses to her by 6 points. Same state, same poll, same electorate. General election does not only involve Republicans. There's independents and Democrats that you have to appeal to as well and polls show Kasich can do it. 
General Election voters know the election isn't going to be held for months. Only a fraction of the electorate(primary voters) is studying the candidates right now, and the rest expect to figure things out later. They'll make up their minds after the conventions, when there are only two candidates to consider.

So when you poll the entire electorate, you are asking them about a decision they haven't bothered to make yet. Clinton has a decades-long reputation of being "progressive" and corrupt. Trump has been smeared nonstop in the media lately. Kasich is a ghost... nobody outside of Ohio knows who he is or what he can be expected to do. Even primary voters haven't paid attention to him because he's never had enough traction to be a contender.

He doesn't have high numbers vs Clinton. Clinton has low numbers against [generic unknown republican who hasn't been smeared yet.]

The polls ask "if the election were held today," but the election won't be held for months, and everyone knows it. Of the people who **are** seriously studying all of the republican candidates, far more of them are voting for Mr. Trump than anyone else. Don't reject the reality in favor of a model.
Ummm Kasich isn't unknown in Ohio though... He's very well known and he beats Clinton by 21 points. I feel like your just making any excuse possible to denounce Kasich's numbers. 

Nationally you may be right but honestly, the fact that no one knows him is his WEAK point and he's ALREADY doing well. The more you know Gov Kasich, the more you know he's a good man and that he is well experienced in his time as a public servant.
Ah jeez
I didn't say he's unknown in Ohio. Ohio is the only place where he isn't unknown. His numbers are meaningless because nobody outside of the state he lives in knows who he is or has any reason to care.

His numbers aren't good, Clinton's are bad. Match up Governor John Doe against Hillary Clinton and he'll do just as well.

I'd have an easier time believing he was a "good man" if he wasn't staying in a race after being mathematically eliminated by the voters. The rotten core of the Republican Party will cling to power by any means necessary and Kasich is a representative member of that group. He's in favor of the business-as-usual betrayals that Republicans routinely deliver to their constituents.

He's the same pro-amnesty, lobbyist-owned, high-spending, big-government type of Republican that lost to Obama in 2008 and 2012. Both McCain and Romney were pushed through the primaries with the same "electability" garbage and worthless polls, and both times the "electable" Republican failed to actually win the election.
Hello I am a web developer just released a new aggregate news website. It will be continuously improving as we go and eventually feature a user section. Please check it out and suggestions are welcome
Also Just noticed the metadata is showing miley cyrus from a breitbart feed. I'll add that on my to do list
Couple things you're wrong here proves to me you don't really know Kasich. You can't compare Kasich to the previous nominees because they never had the same positive pollings as Kasich did. Massachusetts didn't like Romney while Ohio LOVES Kasich (80% approval rating). Yes the rest of the country doesn't know him but if they DID get to know him like Ohio does, then I believe the country will love Kasich too.

To his policy positions that you pointed out. Big spending? You realize he was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget since the man walked in the moon right? And he did that 4 years in a row. Not to mention he enacted the largest tax cuts than any governor in the country while he was in office. Conservative.

Lobbyist owned? He defeated the nursing lobbyist in his own state and is against listening to the special interest groups. He has gone own record saying that no one controls him, only his wife, and I believe it because he has produced RESULTS when he serves in office. 18 yrs in Congress, 2nd term governor, you name it. 

Yes, Kasich is not a hard right wing conservative like Cruz. But we don't need that in the white house. We need someone that can bring conservative principles to the table while uniting the liberals and independents together for a better America.

Oh Johnny boy, you're about 12 months too late for this statement (which is now a flip flop albeit correct position)
They ban everyone from that sub and the conservative sub who isn't for Cruz or Kasich.  Clatsop mods both.  It's the same brilliant strategy that's led to the last two presidential losses.  After each loss they think, "What we're doing wrong is we're not alienating *enough* people..."  
Clinton has so much dirt that bernie doesnt air out.

sadly they constantly pander to the left too.  rinos

Goldwater republicans/conservatives are silenced from both.


Wear the ban like it is a valorous service medal.  
I hate to see the terrorists (mods) win
Yeah it's annoying. Banned me because I didn't think Trump's retweet of Ted's wife was an "attack". Whatever. 
They're not Kasich supporters.  There is one mod over there who is a trump supporter but the remaining are Cruz.  They tolerate us Kasich supporters because we try to be as respectful as we can ... Well usually... we started encouraging civil discussion on KasichForPresident and started discouraging comments aimed at attacking the sub about two months back and things improved for us) and we started backing everything we say with sources.  

That said, sometimes even we get banned.  But it's normally because we get heated not because we support a certain candidate.  
He is fourth in a three man race, his opinion is worthless right now.
His opinion may matter considerably as he has a very high chance of walking out of an open convention as the nominee.
What a loser, obviously getting wasted at parties isn't a healthy decision.
 http://i.imgur.com/WHtKy03.jpg 
Prepping an excuse for his inevitable DUI?
Yeah, the guy who can win is the one who is in 4th place in a 3 man race... yup
Poor Governor Kasich.  He first gives some sensible advice:  be responsible for your own actions and do not abuse alcohol.  Then in the face of screaming ninnies he loses his nerve, gets all flustered, and does his best impression of an invertebrate.
You don't like Trump. That's fine. 

Here's where we're at: Cruz is done. Trump is poised to sweep the next 17 states. He will be your GOP nominee.

What then? Trump v Clinton is happening.
I hate my generation. Bunch of idiots...
You have to push part of the liberal agenda from the conservative platform. Want gay rights locally? The Conservative party doesn't care about restricting gays at the national level. Want to help blacks? The Conservative party wants to get them jobs. Afraid of the military industrial complex? The democrats don't care either. 
&gt; what does that say about our culture?

culture used to be a positive word
I think Kasich is a dunce but I want him to come in 2nd and beat Cruz in this next Northeast primary series.  I'm **WAY WAY** full over the top of talk of Cruz...all of it
Millennials: the most educated *and* least intelligent American generation alive today. 
let's see, Kasich has won **one state**, his own, will not win any more states.  Trump and Cruz will have won 2 dozen or so each by convention time.  so it must be stupid **R** voters who can't see the ~~Bush~~Kasich glory?

my guess is Kasich will accept VP from Trump.  done. election is over

**OR**, Cruz can stop bashing Trump, make nice, and those two can ruin Hillbag
If they keep it up, they're going to be voterless in more ways than they intended.

Given the results in [Washington](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/trump-out-hustled-as-cruz-forces-look-to-pack-state-convention/?platform=hootsuite) and Georgia delegate selections, it looks like it's far from clear Trump gets to 1237. 

&gt; Trump’s effort, by contrast, started late and has shown signs of sloppiness, including an email sent to supporters urging them to sign up to run for delegate at recent conventions and caucuses — two days after a deadline for them to appear on printed delegate ballots.

&gt; “Trump people are totally disorganized. They’re getting beat on the ground because they don’t know how to play the game,” said Kirby Wilbur, a former state Republican chairman and talk-show host on 570 KVI radio, who is an uncommitted delegate to the state convention.

The Cruz ground-game is just too good relative to Trump's. It's far more likely that we head into a contested convention, so I won't be entertaining your Trump v. Clinton hypothetical other than to say I will never be voting for Donald Trump.

Edit: I misspoke and said "brokered" instead of "contested", as they are 2 very different things.
'DON'T GIVE A DARN' Well, I guess you 'DON'T GIVE A DARN' about the future of your political party then. #IchooseCruz 
Look, folks have been predicting a Trump implosion for 10 months straight. Didn't happen, hasn't happened, continues not to happen. At some point you've got to admit that we've gone off the script. 

You're putting faith in the same pundits and polls that predicted Trump's exit last June. These are the same folks who said Cruz in Iowa was a mandate against Trump. The same folks who put Rubio on the cover of TIME as the Republican Party's Next Great Hope.

These cats are wrong. Their finger isn't on the pulse. That's why so many folks in Washington are so scared. Trust me, I know, I worked as a Congressional aide in Washington. I know a lot of these people personally. They're scared as hell by all of this. Not just of Trump, but of Sanders too. This was not how 2016 was supposed to go. This was not The Plan. 

You say you'll never vote Trump. That's a legitimate position. You're a citizen of this great nation, and you've got every right to vote your conscience.

But I'm telling you, this thing is not going away. It's just not. This is happening, with or without the GOP. 
Ehhh once we actually started polling closer to the elections places like FiveThirtyEight have been pretty close. The Sanders upset in Michigan was definitely a huge rebuke to the conventional polling wisdom, though it was probably an indictment of polling methodology more than anything. People have been predicting a Trump implosion and missed it because, I believe, the media were complicit in this farce by giving him absurd amounts of free air time, engaging in baseless speculation, and indulging his absurd claims - lending legitimacy where none was due. I tend to agree with [the argument in this WaPo editorial](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-the-gops-frankenstein-monster-now-hes-strong-enough-to-destroy-the-party/2016/02/25/3e443f28-dbc1-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d_story.html) that the GOP created Trump and he will probably destroy the party. That means this cycle Republicans will lose down-ballot elections, probably the governor's mansion in Indiana, and Democrats winning elections for the foreseeable future. Is this what Trumpers want?

I'm not one to take anecdotal evidence to predict outcomes like this. I've never placed much faith in supermarket check-out aisle news sources, and stick to the numbers. The numbers, right now, don't favor Trump. I guess I can't disagree that this "wasn't how 2016" was supposed to go. It's clear there are plenty of grievances that Republicans have with the GOP establishment - what isn't clear is that Trump addresses any of them with clear policy, and not incoherent rambling. I'm a policy wonk...I like technical details. I enjoy Paul Ryan's proposals, even if I don't agree with them, because there's substance there. Trump is none of that.
I don't disagree, actually. If you're not the typical infantry vet (and thank you  sincerely for your service BTW) I'm not the typical Trump supporter.

We're in a tough spot. America is, Congress is, the *world* is...and the GOP is. 

The GOP says they won't move the bar on 1237. I think that's a bluff. If Trump takes 60% in New York and 50% in CA, I honestly think they will blink first. And if they don't, the house burns down. 

All that means is I think Trump gets the ticket, by hook or by crook. The General is, to your point, still open season. 

And yes, you did make a good point about Eisenhower -- but it's fair to say politics in 2016 are not the same as politics in 1952. That inference may be grounded in the factual, but it's at the very least misleading.

Trump's rise has eclipsed what should be the biggest political story of 2016 -- indeed, the biggest political story since 1974 -- and that is the imminent indictment of Hillary Clinton.

If Trump secures the GOP ticket, and Hillary goes down for treason, it really doesn't matter what the polls say. 

If Trump secures the nomination, and Hillary *escapes* indictment, it will be purely on the basis of insider corruption. If voters didn't like Colorado, imagine how they'll react to a scandal of that magnitude.

On the other hand, if Trump *doesn't* get the nomination, it'll be because of GOP convention shenanigans, and that will be seen as insider corruption as well. Since Hillary's foibles are a zero-sum game for the DNC, Trump stands a reasonable shot as a third-party candidate against a Romney or Kasich ticket. 

There's only one path forward for the GOP that doesn't end in a dumpster fire. Trump is holding the high hand, and he's just letting the table raise. 
I mean if you support Israel more than America, I guess I could see that. 
Yes let's nominate someone who mathematically has no chance and has no intention of being allied with Russia.
All of those Hd videos of him posing with his family and reading to his kids are so transparent.  The guy is so fake it's painful to watch him pretend.

And you think the other two do?

[Statistically its improbable](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/can-you-get-trump-to-1237/) that trump will get the nomination by just delegates and Cruz's new total basically he needs around 93% of the remaining vote (also not likely to happen).

This is headed for a open convention so maybe we should start looking at who can win the general election.  Right now that's Kasich

Where was this "fiery rhetoric" a year ago?
What does the NRA have to do with this?
"Singer is also working to change the GOP platform that now endorses natural marriage."

Good on him. Useless and outdated part of the platform.
&gt;Cruz is working to counteract that possibility, he said, by highlighting his own anti-illegal immigration stance and his focus on bringing “jobs back to America.” He said expects that approach will bring “most “ of those voters back to his side and out to the polls should he win the nomination.

Kind of optimistic there Ted.
&gt;One of its many lessons is that if authoritarianism really comes to America, it won’t come slouching out of the dark heart of Middle America, wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross. A flag pin it will have, no doubt. But on the other lapel will be a button that says I Love New York.

What a pretentious douche canoe

Kasich is #4 in a 3-way race.

He needs over $100% of the remaining delegates to reach 1237.
Gee golly, gosh darn!
&gt; he needs over $100% of the remaining delegates 

So?  None of the remaining candidates are likely to get the nom at this point.  

Cruz needs 93% of he remaining vote 

And trump is statistically unlikely to get enough delegates either [as this will help show](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/can-you-get-trump-to-1237/)

This is heading for an open convention and we should start looking at who can actually win in November by the largest margin.
The left has been trying to build this narrative against Kasich that he's anti-woman.  They are doing this because his opponent will likely be a woman.  And they know how badly he'll ~~beat~~ defeat her.

It's the same thing with that whole "left the kitchen" comment.  They are literally grasping at straws.
If none of them get the required delegates they just have Hillary flip a coin.
I flipped a coin for you, /u/WeLoveOurPeople The result was: heads

Haha.  Worked out well in the primaries for her.
It is very possible that if Trump and Cruz don't come together that Kasich or someone who didn't even run could become the nominee in a brokered convention. I know Cruz doesn't like Trump but the best way to guarantee that the people's votes matter is a Trump/Cruz ticket. 
I dislike Cruz, but I admit that's true. I'd even settle for it.
I see why you say this but I can't see Donald accepting this.
This columnist needs to get in line behind all the others.  Good luck on that by the way.
Remember that time a man running for President conceded that he would settle for VP?  Me neither, but it happens.
I'm pretty sure the majority don't want him anywhere near a position of power anyway.  Makes it easy.
The columnist will probly succumb to aids. 
They ALL say that when they're currently running. No one currently running for president is going to admit they'd settle for a VP pick
Well he changed his tune when he endorsed him today :http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-city-mayor-rudy-giuliani-endorses-donald-trump/story?id=38506385
He shouldn't spend too much time thinking about it since there's zero chance Trump picks him for VP. 
Wasn't the second place winner VP in the olden days?
Me neither, really. Just saying my own view.

I'd be entertained by VP Cruz and President Trump. We haven't had a VP and Pres who hated each other for a long-ass time.
I agree but our man is a man of principle. 
He's poised to win states he was expected to win? How is this news?
[deleted]
&gt; The hate

Hippie.
Your great vocabulary has convinced me that I was wrong.  Will the other conservatives ever forgive me?
You mentioned "hate" at least three times in your post. It seemed the most appropriate assessment.
Because he's somewhat normal and not a right wing dingbat like cruz or the rest of his ilk. 
So then why isn't he doing better overall? 
The last election to have that was in [1800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800)
Well, am I wrong that people are being hateful towards people with a difference of opinion today.
That is not a phenomenon that just got started "today", but you misapply it.  Differences of political opinion are not "hate."
We have zero interest in you, Senator Turdburger. GTFO.
I think it was the 'New York values' comment. Probably the voter hated both Trump and Cruz, so they threw away their vote. 
Yeah wonder how the campaign decided that was okay. It definitely sounded like a prepared line. New Yorkers have a lot of pride, and it's never good to just dismiss a region like that. 
People's ways of expressing their differences of opinion could be seen as hateful.  Id say not hearing people out and having a civil discussion, is either trolling or being hateful.
and just between us, by "today" I'm suggesting in "today's world". 
The Anyone-But-Trump types in New York shifted from Cruz to Kasich due to Cruz's anti NY remarks.
New York values.
If that is really his belief, he should throw his support behind trump once he becomes mathematically eliminated next week. (currently Cruz needs 92.3% of the remaining delegates to win)


~~winning~~ whining

FTFY
The true Conservatives in NY split long ago because of NY liberal values, formed their own party.
?
The new York conservative party is where the true NY conservatives reside
New York rejected Cruz because he's creepy zealot
Not sure what party you're talking about . . . 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_New_York_State?wprov=sfla1
Hmm interesting. What have they accomplished recently? I didn't know this existed. 
They're a minority in NY, so not a lot.
I do not want a contested convention, so this is good news.
Contested conventions are the worst. 
Republican Representative Peter King of Long Island voted for Kasich to "send a message" to Trump that he needs to get more serious.   He went on to say he would take cyanide if Cruz got the nomination.  That pretty much sums up the average Republican in New York who did not vote for Trump.
No, Bob over in accounting is the worst.  Contested conventions are a close second tho.  
Except if he can get to a contested convention, he can.
That seems to be a common opinion on Cruz. 
in New York County, the center of the establishment...hence even Trump lost there
How does the person who wrote this article not forget to breath? 

Delegate count is based on state population, and Cruz is an Anti-Federalist, not a Federalist. 

Voter turnout ≠ delegate weight
So cruz is sort of admitting he can't even beat a campaign that barely functions...
The point is, Trump never complains when these arcane rules favor him disproportionately. But when he loses, suddenly he's all about "democracy."
His points aren't invalid. Colorado, Wisconsin, both states did not caucus or primary with a direct democratic election, both states Ted Cruz won, theres hints of fraud and foul play all over the place from candidates who have roots in the establishment towards the outsiders. 

Kasich, and soon to be Cruz are still in the race when democracy eliminates them, hoping for a contested convention. 

You want a leader that tucks his tail between his legs and goes home when he loses? 

The guy could say nothing about losing and still have a 300 delegate lead. What difference does it make? This is politics, not a ballroom dance with a 7 course meal after. Etiquette comes second at best, to purpose.
&gt; You want a leader that tucks his tail between his legs and goes home when he loses?

I'd prefer one who doesn't cry about it like Trump does.
Biggest takeaway I get from this is what i have been thinking all along. Even if Trump doesnt get 1237 on the first ballet, there is no way the nomination goes to anyone else if he is close. Hes so far ahead in votes and delegates it would be political suicide for the GOP to nominate someone different. Trumps got this wrapped up even if he doesnt get the full 1237. 
Trump should get out, He can't win the general election.
It's been fun watching the opposition go full retard in spite of the inevitability.
ya. #nevertump is one of the dumbest movements i have seen in a long time. probably worse than S4P...
[deleted]
Who do you think can win?
I think the idea was that if Cruz could claw his way to even or ahead of Trump before the convention, that would be one thing. But if he's at most some very distant second also-ran, there's no way they'd do it. There would be too many fires to put out at the convention, and I don't mean that metaphorically.

Beyond that, the fallout would go beyond the nomination and spill over into other races.
Apparently it will be very similar to an Easter Egg hunt.

So your crying about him crying is somehow superior?
[removed]
Because Cruz can? Lol he couldn't even win the most populated States within his own party, he lost them by huge margins, let alone a general. 

And if you think he's gonna do well in California I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
Fancy your saying that... Trump is quite familiar with selling 'bridges' to gullible sheep.
nope. Trump can win on first ballot

so close
He sells bridges to humans. And casinos. And apartments.
And takes them away from old ladies. And likes his steak well done, btw.
He didn't take it away from an old lady. Her son finally sold it after he died.

And I know. That's why I'm Rare!
Good thing he's never done that.

He wins them honestly by the people. Unlike lying, cheating, and for being an all-around schmuck Cruz.
Trump is just about the furthest thing from honest I've ever seen. And by the way, parroting my disses back to me is just plain lazy. 
You didn't say anything original to begin with, plus it was projecting.

No shame in recycling. Trump is the most honest person running. Cruz won't even admit his affair with Amanda Carpenter.

SAD!
Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha.









No.
&gt; Trump is the most honest person running

http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/616/888/72a.gif
It's good for you to laugh at yourself. :)
I would just love to see the face you make while talking about how honest Trump is.  Comedy gold.
Comedy gold because you enjoy George Soros puppets like Kasich, Cruz, and Hillary? 

Yes. Comedy GOLD!
Trump has by far the best chance against Hillary, mostly because the GOP loses half their voters if Trump doesn't get the nomination.
No, he is done.  You shouldn't believe everything you hear on the news.
What mind fuckingly stupid shit is this. He wants him to drop out but also not release his delegates? So he wants him to drop out, hurt himself, and not help Trump? Does this fucking bozo even understand that ONLY kasich is going to come in 2nd in the north east? What a dumbass. I can't wait till both of these fucking retards are gone. Neither of them are getting vp. Trump is going to pick a female and cripple Hillary's only vote getting tool; her vagina.
&gt;...mostly because the GOP loses half their voters if Trump doesn't get the nomination.

Wait, what. Did you just straight up ignore the [stat](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-the-weakest-gop-front-runner-in-the-modern-era/) I referenced?
You said that "half" of the GOP voters will bolt if Trump doesn't get the nomination. Where are you getting this idea? Especially since Trump loses in every single poll against Hillary and [has never led the RCP average](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html) against Hillary. Even if "half" of them bolt, where do you think they'll go? Hillary is a Centre-Right Dem. Trump is....what, exactly, is he again? Like I said...two thirds of GOP voters have essentially voted against him. So, no, your argument does not stand up to scrutiny. Present some evidence that 1) Trump does well against Hillary in polling and 2) GOP voters will bolt if the GOP doesn't make only 1/3 of their voters happy. The whining of the Trump crowd never ceases to amaze me, especially in the face of things like math.


&gt;Ryan has flattered the House Freedom Caucus and pursued promises to empower rank-and-file Republicans with reforms to how the House operates — yet it’s yielded little in the way of actual results.

Another all-talk, no-action politician folks!

whatever they come up, it has to work better than with it did with Boehner
Trumpbots may be downvoting this, but I'll upvote. According to most smart estimates, Trump cannot win the vote on first ballot even if he kills it in the Northeast corridor. Which means the only, ONLY thing that matters is what happens in the contested convention. 

If you don't think Cruz can win in a contested convention, then you're just lying to yourself.
&gt;Leftist-anarchist website Its Going Down.org provides “a report from Pittsburgh anarchists” describing their “full disruption and confrontation” of attendees of a Donald Trump rally held last week in the Pennsylvania town of Oakland.
So it'll be leftist-anarchist versus white nationalist-populist.

I'm glad I'm neither of the above.

Ah, so Trump gets to attack other businesses for offshoring but when he does it he gets a pass because of "global economics". I read you loud and clear, chief. My sports coats are made right here in the U.S. of fucking A by Hardwick Clothes and Hart, Schaffner, and Marx. Who are you wearing?

You don't know me and you don't have a clue about what  I understand so you can keep your personal attacks to yourself.

Nice.
Trump is a victim of our poor trade policy's. Let's see if you even understand that simple metric.

This intellectually bankrupt statement is brought to you courtesy of the Trump fandom, folks.
He is an outsider in his own party.

Suck it up and vote Trump. Get the 4 years and break the political monopoly.
Well it could be a matter of not being able to domestically secure the proper materials and a US factory to produce them.

But what I actually think happened here is a clothing company asked to use his name for their goods and he said ye$$$. Trump probably does not have a say where the product is produced. I'm sure he only buys US.
the MSM is run by old grey beards who want to bring back the good old days with the Cold War.  
Agreed, but I would add it's worse than that!

1) Trump has not yet debated Hillary.

2) Fox (who is extremely anti-Trump) just released a national poll on the voters' choice for GOP nominee. Trump- 48%.
Oh look. Another one.
1) Not relevant at all, unless you're suggesting that Trump actually wins converts in his debates, which hasn't been shown.

2) When's the last time you watched Fox? Hannity pitches him softballs every time he's on. You could maybe say Megyn Kelly is anti-Trump, but she's really just being a journalist is all. Can you cite the poll? Fox is notorious for flagging their internet polls on TV and acting like they're a) a representative sample and b) without the self-selection bias of only coming from Fox watchers - which would over sample on Trump supporters since they *overwhelmingly* watch Fox.
Nevermind that Ted Cruz is a total liability vs. Hillary Clinton because he represents everything the left and center hate about the Republican party (social conservative values) you can't expect people to take an article written by "Mr. Right" that starts with;

"Let’s be honest. The elites and the establishment in the GOP fear Ted Cruz more than Donald Trump. Why?  Because he’s one of a small minority of elected officials who refuses to compromise and play ball with them. He is not a cronyist. He is a stalwart who, agree with him or not, stands on principle. And he might just be the most qualified person to run for office in quite some time."

It's a total campaign piece that nobody should take seriously. 
&gt; he represents everything the left and center hate about the Republican party

That is far more applicable to Trump.
Oh, but he will. It will be incredible. Also, check the polls over time. He has steadily increased in popularity. Something caused that.

I try not to watch it (to your second point, Trump supporters hate Fox because of their Cruz bias), but usually when I'm at a diner eating breakfast, it's on and they're downtalking Trump, discussing alternatives (even third-party options), blowing Cruz's chances out of proportion, and even bringing on guests to discuss how "racist" Trump is. It pisses me off.

Sorry, it was apparently Huffington Post that had Trump at 48%.

http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/polls/morning-consult-24311

Fox has him at 45%. If you click on their poll for 2016 National Republican Primary, you'll see a few others, including Fox at 45%. Some polls even have him over 50%.
How so? He was a Democrat for years, just said today that he supports transsexuals utilizing whatever restroom they're most comfortable with and has more female executives working in his corporations than male ones. Trump's much more nuanced in his policy stances. He takes a hard line on immigration but Ted Cruz agrees 100% with Trump's stance on immigration. Cruz is so much a social conservative he supported a bill that would outlaw masturbation. Dude is stuck in the iron age and there is no way he is gonna pull the center vote. 
If you scroll down on that poll, you'll see that Trump is running at a 69% unfavorable rating (including "very unfavorable" and "unfavorable), and is behind Clinton 46% to 37%...in a poll of 4015 registered voters. The 48% stat you cite is registered Republicans, and is a somewhat small sample size (1,413). I would be extremely skeptical of those numbers. The *actual* polls, the ones where voters cast a ballot, only have him at 37% so far. So I remain unconvinced that a) Trump is the choice of a majority of Republicans (admittedly, it's hard to classify Trump as a Republican since he only recently and somewhat schizophrenically has begun espousing Republican principles and has done so with little consistency) and b) that he can beat Clinton - with unfavorables that high it seems highly unlikely that independents and undecideds would break for him in any meaningful way. It also seems perfectly reasonable to discuss Trump's bombastic statements in the context of what it says about his character - which to me seems hardly that of someone fit to lead The Republic. Since Trump does not really represent the principles of the party, it also seems reasonable to discuss the idea of an *actual Republican* running on a third party ticket in the event that Trump does win the nomination, however unlikely that is.

It's pretty clear that it will be mathematically impossible for Cruz to reach 1237 delegates before the convention, but I think the general point is that the remaining candidates are taking an "accumulation" strategy to deny him the nomination on the first ballot and defeat him in subsequent rounds of voting, as has been done in past contested conventions. Dwight D. Eisenhower emerged from a contested convention.
&gt; outlaw masturbation

Please make sure you know what you're talking about before typing out nonsense.
Don't change the subject. 
Yes, the statistics have him behind Clinton. Again, they haven't debated yet. Things will change.

Trump has always been conservative. In his books he talks about conservative values, the only thing he was liberal on was abortion, and he explains why his viewpoint on that has changed.

It's clear that Trump is the one they're trying to keep away from 1237. Cruz will win in a contested convention because it doesn't give the people a voice, just the establishment. Cruz is currently the establishment candidate.
There are some they companies that can and do produce clothing in the US. Trump should put his money where his big mouth is.

Donald saying he would let Brucie (A MAN) use his bathroom does not mean transgender is a real thing. These people have a mental illness, plain and simple. 
Notice it was unstickied pretty fast, eh?


&gt;Nothing is changing about casual funny politically incorrect tranny jokes like we've always had, but the mod staff recognizes that Trump would let a tranny use whichever bathroom they want it the Trump Tower. Do all the ordinary every day "transphobia" you want, attack helicopter jokes are funny, but that view is officially one of Trump's and I'm not going to allow this to be a place where Trump fans are getting shat upon for supporting Trump's views. White knight virtue signaling is gay, but this sub has no official problem with thinking trannies should pick their bathrooms.

But he's also not anti Chinese manufacturing. He never said that. He is fine with manufacturing outside of the US as long as it isn't an American company leaving the US to manufacture elsewhere cheaper. 
There's a difference between a bad system and a rigged system. When Trump wins 60% of the vote and gets 95% of the delegates, that's a bad system. When the GOP hates Trump and changes their rules so that they can allocate all of the delegates to whoever they want without a vote in order to prevent a Trump nomination, that's a rigged system.
[deleted]
doubtful.  It the conversation moves to policy instead of "how yuge his hands are" Kasich comes alive and crushes it.  

didn't get to see that much during the debates.
Who?
"John Kasich is winning millions upon millions less votes than Hillary, but he can win against Hillary!" 
I'm a big fan of Kasich, but for all intents and purposes he is out of this election. I think his continuing to run in spite of his low delegate count is contributing to the shady RNC backdoor politics that are going on right now.

He's won 148 delegates so far while his opponents are at 845 and 559. With such a small share, it's unusual that a candidate in his situation would even be running this late in the primary. Even in a contested convention scenario, it'd be extremely unlikely he'd take the nomination.

The fact that Kasich hasn't dropped out makes me think he is running to take votes away from Trump -- knowing full well that open-minded, moderate republicans may be more likely to vote for Trump than for Cruz. If Trump doesn't get to the 1,237 threshold, it's possible Cruz could steal the nomination and maybe that's what Kasich is running for.

I think it's unfair. Not in the spirit of democratic voting.
Kasich is running to steal the nomination from everyone.  Not just trump.  He is in this to win this.
The troop leader we had up through my Star rank was a great leader, and we did all sorts of cool stuff. Lots of hikes and camping intermixed with badge work. Then he left and a new troop leader came in that was just about merit badges and meetings, but hardly ever planned outings. Just wasn't as fun, and a few of my friends ended up dropping out. So eventually I lost interest and dropped out as well.
Party wide break up in 3...2........
I have a hard time believing this, but I'll admit some ignorance on how contested conventions work.

My impression is that most delegates are free to vote however they choose only by the THIRD round in which a clear majority is not reached.

What would prevent the unbound delegates in the SECOND round from reaching a majority on either Cruz or Trump? For that matter.. how many delegates would become unbound? Are you assuming that most or all of them switch to Kasich to prevent a majority and initiating the third round of voting?
[deleted]
Actually 1980 and 2004 both had that.
I am trying to remember what this was in reference.  and its killing me
He can't.  Hardly anyone has voted for him so far, and no one is going to vote for him if he steals the nomination in a back room deal.  Anyone that thinks otherwise is as delusional as Kasich himself.

It's time to move past these discussions, Trump has all but secured this nomination.  Don't believe the lying media when you hear anything different.  They are merely trying to keep ratings up.

It is time to unite under the future President, Donald J. Trump.  Together we can Make America Great Again.
&gt; but I'll admit some ignorance on how contested conventions work

this is my favorite analysis of how the convention plays out and it is scary accurate.

I will vote for an independent like johnson before trump.  Trump is scary in the abuses of authority he would entail does not appeal to me in the slightest. 

General election, not primary.
That is the subject of the article.
that may be, but the job is **winning** the election.  Cruz and his qualifications can't do that.  we need a bone crusher like Trump to whack Hillbag once and for all

I mean...just look at the face put up with this post.  he looks like he needs to take a dump
This seems like a lot of speculation... how can you say it's "scary accurate"?

Also, assuming this scenario is exactly what happened, I wouldn't count on Kasich to win the GE if Trump/Cruz are running on an independent ticket. The conservative vote would be divided, making an easy victory for Clinton.
What abuses of authority?  There is a system of checks and balances in the government for that reason.
The funniest part about this is that Priebus doesn't get it. Not only am I #NeverTrump. I'm also # NeverCruz... and I'm guessing the people who are in "Lying Ted's" camp may not be quick top back Trump... or those who voted for "Sweaty little Marco"... or any of the others Trump has insulted repeatedly for the last year.

Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus is so fucking removed he doesn't even realize or acknowledge this as an issue.

&gt;Politics is a team sport, and we can’t win unless we rally around whoever becomes our nominee,”

Unlike you, Priebus - I am not willing to vote for anyone who has an (R) after their name on the ballot.

&gt;They’re trying out for our team. No one is forcing them to wear our jersey.

No one is forcing me to wear it either, buddy. So when you decide to     treat Trump as if he should be treated with respect - instead of denying him legitimacy at the outset... don't be surprised when no one shows up on game day.

I didn't leave the GOP. The GOP left me.
I don't think Cruz would try that.  Trump might but the loss of his supporters would likely end up balanced out by all the Bernie supporters that can't stand Hillary (they are legion)
reince priebus reminds me of that dork in high school who thought he was all that because he was president of the Star Trek club

that being said I hope he's supporting trump because he's afraid of losing his job

they all are and all elected officials should be afraid of losing their jobs all the time
Who are you backing?  I'm just curious.
How so? every time policy was actually discussed, Kasich had only 1 line to spout off "I balanced a budget". That is the entire extent of his policies

This is literally the tip of the iceberg with him.

People say he's going to swing left after the primary but to me that just shows how much of a politician he really is.  Why not go with the guy that has been upfront about his positions and policies from the beginning?
 
He looks like a moderate Bernie supporter that spams Anti-Conservative stuff in subreddits 
That's kind of the problem they never really gave him a chance to talk more about it.  Or anyone else's for that matter.  It was mainly all meta election crap

Did you ever see him get to talk about foreign policy?

They kept trying to cut him off but he went around they world and addressed country by country what he would do.


No one.

I'm a George W Bush Republican. I supported Romney over McCain in 08, but voted McCain. I still supported Romney in 2012, but felt he moved too far to placate the religious conservatives with the amendment for straight marriage stuff, and obviously his 47% comments didn't help... but where he really tanked it was the second debate about foreign policy and his inability to explain why Bengazi was bad (Aside from the fact that people died.) His entire foreign policy seemed to be "The Iraq War did suck, democrats are right, and I would do what Obama is doing."

His inability to explain why it was wrong to arm untrained and unaccountable civilian militias, destroy the gaddafi government from the air and have special forces on the ground directing the militias, and then abandon Libya without restoring order - and compare that to the democracy that is Iraq.

And it's the same here in 2016. Not even Jeb did a good job pulling W out from under the bus, and every GOP candidate has a "The Iraq War Was A Mistake" speech followed by essentially saying they would do the same thing Obama did in Syria and Libya.

EDIT: Why would I vote for the guy in 2016 who says the Iraq war was a mistake, but who also supported it from 02-09? I wouldn't. Who would?

And here we are in 2016 with Trump, the loudest of the "Bush was an idiot" GOP members with the lead. Why? Because in the very first debate every other GOP leader stood up and promised to vote for him if he won - rather than denounce him as the fool and populist that he is.

So I'm in an interesting position - and will most likely vote 3rd party. I might even vote Hillary... and if you read the last 4 years of my anti-hillary posts you'd see how much that really says...

Why? Because even though I disagree with her at every turn, I do believe that Hillary believes her own bullshit. Trump? Trump doesn't even believe his own bullshit, and that is his genius plan to get people on board this week... to send out surrogates claiming the first 68 years of his life was just a boorish act and we are about to witness the Real Trump Transformation... like some fucking pokemon animal maybe...

Not only has the GOP lost me, I don't see a path back to me.

How many are like me out of the 60 million that voted Romney? Right off the bat in 2016 there is a deficit there. Then add in the Cruz and Rubio and others that may not feel like I do about politics but do feel the same about Trump.
Trump is no "bone crusher." He can't even unite the party behind him. Besides, [Trump has insecurity issues.](http://thefederalist.com/2015/06/16/donald-trumps-fake-2016-campaign-is-a-cry-for-help/)
Ok, I was just curious.
You are so misinformed I'm not even going to waste my time correcting you.  I will say you should listen to the actual videos and Trump's comments instead of believing the headlines which are outright lies.  You are the kind of person the media loves, and I doubt you are a republican because you support illegal immigration and many other liberal stances.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/22/illegal-immigrant-families-set-record-pace-2016/

I could do this for all your "sources," but you aren't worth it.  If you actually care you can do some research on your own, for once.

Two sides to the story, you choose liberal spin every time.

Edit:  If Kasich was relevant, you would not support him.  No one has attacked him, if they had you would buy it hook, line, and seeker and probably be supporting Hillary by now.  
I support legalization not citizenship there's a difference.

And your just coping out by questioning the source instead of addressing the issue.


&gt; I could do this for all your "sources," but you aren't worth it. 


Please do Id love to hear what you consider a source.
You support people coming here illegally and giving them a free pass.
No Kasich's plan would have them pay a fine and give us their tax revenue, while at the same time not shutting down the bussniess they own or work for.

Deporting them all would COST us more money than we can afford.  Which one of us is the republican again?
Enforcing laws has a cost.  Pay a fine?  How many of these illegals can afford any kind of substantial fine?  What about the people waiting years to come here legally?  You want the easy way out, but that won't even work.

Regardless, Kasich isn't relevant in this election and never was.  Start choosing between Clinton and Trump, because those are your two choices.
Now it's time for GOP unity? Looks a bit disingenuous when NeverTrump is bashed the moment it looks like they're heading for a failure.

This doesn't strike me as a man calling out for party unity. It strikes me as a man saying 'I like my job and the influence that comes with it. Please don't try to remove me from it, I can make nice.'
As I've already a said I will vote for an independent libertarian before that happens 
I consider Trump's actual words to be a source, not a secondary source like the liberal media.  Go to college and try citing one of your sources in a paper.
The PoS only says this because Trump is going to win now. Back when there was any chance of them stopping him he played games. Now that there is only one outcome this pile of dog shit comes in and acts like he called for unity. Fuck him and I will remember.
Ok, good luck getting them elected.  Spoiler alert, you'll be a loser twice.

Edit:  To be clear, I don't hate you for voting Kasich.  We obviously both feel strong in our opinion.  I wanted to come back and let you know that I am an independent that started out as a Bernie voter (embarrassed to say).  I watched one of the Republican debates for a laugh, and a couple things Trump said got me interested enough to find out more.  I basically watched everything he has ever said on YouTube, then started noticing how the media articles and TV spun everything he did to make him look bad.  They are the liars, jokes, bullshitters, etc. in my judgement.  You will never get the true story unless you learn more about the man himself.  If you look at both sides and still support Kasich/third-party guy, ok.  Thanks for coming in and debating your opinion like an adult.  You stood up to everyone's criticism well, better than I can do.

[Trump supported the assault weapons ban, among other liberal policies on guns](https://theintercept.com/2016/01/27/donald-trump-in-2000-i-support-the-ban-on-assault-weapons/)

I'm not really sure Cruz wins in a contested convention. He's also quite hated within the party elite...Trump has done an amazing job, rhetorically speaking, of framing Cruz as the establishment candidate to voters. His command of the media cycle is quite impressive, and perhaps that might be his one advantage going into a head-to-head with Clinton.

The GOP, IMHO, is sort in a damned-if-they-do-damned-if-they-don't position wrt Trump. They nominate him...the Party, as it's historically been represented, is over since Trump doesn't really espouse typical conservative principles on e.g. Free Trade, and his border and immigration policies, while proposed under the guise of conservatism, more realistically represent Statist policies of European Fascists from last century. Then again...if they don't nominate him, a non-trivial amount of the party freaks out. It's only ~1/3 that are hardcore Trump backers but if you include the people who perceive the process to be "rigged" (it isn't, but still perception is what matters here) regardless of if they support Trump there's the potential for the GOP to not have an ideological grounding for the first time since, well, Nixon? I'm not really sure (all I know about Nixon-era conservatism is what I've read in history books since I'm not old enough to remember him personally).

Anyway, appreciate the exchange.
Who?
Russia should honestly be our #1 ally.  There's no other non islamic, non cucked modern countries left in the world.  Japan and Poland come in tied for 2nd place behind Russia.
[this guy](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-best-reporting-on-john-kasich-through-the-years)
So you would rather have Hillary or Sanders? A non vote is a vote for them. If you are for no one, left the GOP, why are you posting these diatribes? Seems cunty. 
The reporting on this guy is so bipolar. The media can't decide if he's pro-Trump or anti-Trump.
He's trying to be both.
Then the new announcement they quickly buried, they are shoe-horning in mental illness in with the new republican movement. Donald Trump saying he would let Brucie use his shitter doesn't mean he supports, "**tranny rights**". Guess what trannies already have?



**ALL THE SAME RIGHTS YOU HAVE!**
This mod, /u/bobstooder, /u/CisWhiteMaelstrom are the SJW majority trying to get this shit bannable.


We can't let this happen. Voat was really good about weeding these people out. I plan on posting directly to /r/the_donald with alts to raise awareness. Centipedes are on top of that sub, people will get the word out.
You're shouting on deaf ears. The same mods at r/The_Donald also own this subreddit. 
Good, ban me there, too. Isn't going to help your cause in my tiny little rebellion, sir.
Alt right cuck
Yep, you're right. This sub is mostly inactive. I am going to have to just float vpn's and try to sneak submission into /r/the_donald to raise awareness to what you guys are up to. The centipedes are great because they auto-vote submissions that look good at first glance. Strong willed folks. I'm sure some of them want to know you guys are trying to shoe-horn tranny rights into the new republican party.


See you tomorrow morning!
The American people have been deciding and will continue to decide the merit of this title. As far as I'm concerned, winning only in your home state and the crazy mormon/evangelical midwest isn't the way to prove to the majority of conservatives that you're the right candidate for the job. Ted Cruz is no better or worse off than Rick Perry or Rick Santorum were when they ran. The writing is on the wall and you know it, stop pretending like your cause is just. Donald Trump has massive leads in every single northeast state, California and now Indiana. It is time for you to make the decision whether you want to ruin the Republican party ON TOP of handing the general election to Hillary Clinton. This election is about putting our strongest candidate forward to stop the liberals from appointing a number of supreme court justices that will change this country for years to come. Ted Cruz is NOT our strongest candidate, nor is John Kasich. We get it, you don't like Trump, but if you choose to withhold your vote this November, you are doing your part in helping the liberals ruin our country. The only political campaign that I attended this year was John Kasich's, whom I supported once Jeb Bush dropped out. I soured on him once it became clear to me that he had no possible way to win the election in a manner that gives the American people their chance to be heard. Thousands if not millions of Americans have died so that they may vote in this country and I never questioned our representative system because nobody in the front runner position in past elections ever drew attention to it. Now that the spotlight is shining on our arcane system of assigning delegates, it is mind boggling how we allow it. If every American's vote is just as good as the next person's, then why does someone who just wants to choose which candidate they agree most with require a political science degree just to understand our system? Its not right and it is only in place to protect the political profession much in the same way that the CPAs and lawyers have their own convoluted jargon that makes zero sense to outsiders. I truly believe that Donald Trump will be able to beat Hillary Clinton in November because the American people are sick and tired of this victim culture that has taken hold of our country and much of Europe. We turn the wealthy into villains for being successful and starting their own companies and we see our colleges being strong-armed into changing the names of 200 year old buildings because the person they're named after owned a slave... On top of that, the deluge of illegal immigrants coming into this country and taking our blue collar jobs is causing the value of that labor to go down, which creates the need for people to use unions that should not exist in a free market. We are diluting the fabric of this country and it sickens me to death.

TLDR:LYIN' TED!!!
Exactly! It's far too late. All the sneks have drawn a line in the sand, but want to be on the other side of it once they realize it's not working out. 
You know I was wondering where people got the idea to start spouting this nonsense or where it even came from. Now I know
&gt; He can't even unite the party behind him

he's working on that via grass roots.  meanwhile, Republicans and 99% of the establishment are using all their strength to stop the unification
I am guessing most of Kaisch's ads were run in Ohio and not the rest of the states. 
I don't trust that preibus guy even one millimeter
This is pure silliness.  It's obvious Trump is intentionally being hyperbolic and sarcastic to make a broader point.  That point is easily identifiable.  

Why you would need to fact check obvious hyperbole is beyond me unless you've got something to spin.
Gwb was one of our greatest presidents. 
That's a laugh.  What does a liberal New York rich boy know about grassroots.
&gt; What does a liberal New York rich boy know

he knows how to win, versus lyin' Ted and all the other losers
[Accurate depiction of this "fact checking."](http://i.imgur.com/ker2OWq.gif)
Mostly it was Wisconsin that whole soros lie that Cruz spread was the big one.
On the one hand, I don't trust the current GOP elites. On the other hand, rolling over and dying in the hopes of keeping their jobs is their exact modus operandi.
This is why you support a candidate instead of starting a campaign to nominate anyone except one person.  If that one person wins, you have written your own death certificate.  I hope Trump support overtakes Utah so they throw Romney out on his ear for attacking the most popular candidate of his party.
[removed]
Rubios anti kasich ads were in Illinois and Florida.  They may also have been in Virginia.
&gt;I might even vote Hillary

Wow. If you even remotely consider Hillary Clinton as someone who would benefit America as President, it's obvious that you are immune to reason.

Edit: a word
you know, a little social justice is okay especially when it saves money...
I get worried when the enemy (RP) **suddenly** changes his tune
I live in Utah right now, very close minded and obedient population. It might go blue this year unless Romney or the RNC changes their tune. 
Even as a Kasich supporter this has been something that has frustrated me about the campaign.

The idea that any candidate will capitulate to any other is hilarious, but yet they ask for all the same.
Nice opinion. Doesn't change the fact he can't be President again. 
Democrats like to plan out society. Republicans like more of an anarchy type of society. 
That is true. Democrat 'tolerance' is only tolerance for agreeing viewpoints. All others are subject to shunning, mocking, persecution, and prosecution.
not anarchy. freedom.
anarchy literally means no rulers 
A lot of Republicans, even the more adamantly religious ones, just want to be able to run their (private) institutions and their homes as they see fit, in peace. There's places where that's not the case - abortion for many, and gay marriage before the SCOTUS went crazy - but by and large people just want to be left alone to self-police.

For many democrats, particularly ones who are democrat due to social issue temperament, they're on a mission to police the world, and see the government as key to obliterating 'evil and wicked' viewpoints.
The problem is really just that in America we kind of use the wrong words for certain terms. Liberal, by definition and as used in most other western countries, is basically Libertarian, or what a lot of Republicans really are. In Europe, liberals are generally people who want less government regulation, more free markets, more personal freedom, etc. Liberals in the us are generally seen as authoritarian, big government supporters, and welfare supporters. In reality, these are not liberals, they're authoritarians. Now, conservative as a term is seen quite differently in the us based on who you're asking, and a lot of people with different views dee themselves as conservative. In Europe, conservatives are generally people that want to conserve social order, religion, and European/western culture, they generally are intolerant of non western people or cultures or just advocate for putting Europeans first. This makes sense with the name, to conserve, and definitely many American conservatives match this description. There are also a lot of Republicans/conservatives who I believe are more accurately classical liberal or libertarian. People that want smaller government influence and power all around, those who want a more free economy, lower spending and taxes, but also advocate for personal liberties, such as the right to marry who you want, put whatever you want in your own body, and do whatever you want with your own business, also sometimes call themselves conservatives. These people are most likely libertarians, they just don't know it.
What viewpoints are being prosecuted?
Attorneys general of blue states are prosecuting climate change skeptics, pro life activists and various other ' thought crimes'.
Anarchy is freedom without responsibility. 
I think the state provides a better scapegoat than say, Rothbardian anarcho-capitalism.  The state allows psychopaths to get away with theft and murder because their activities are seen as legitimate for they are done "with the consent of the governed." You and I know that the consent is not explicit and the social contract is a bullshit concept manufactured by the left.
 

In a private law society that is bound together by a free market of individuals and their voluntary contracts, you have the ultimate network of checks and balances against corruption as well as full attribution.  True consent.  Voluntary virtue.  Moral (or immoral) outcomes with immediate consequences.  As republicans we lean more towards an ideal world described by someone like Rothbard, a world in which Barry Goldwater alluded to as "having a government so small you can drown it in a bathtub."  This is the world that people like me idealize to anchor republicans in the right direction.  Anarcho-Capitalism, Voluntaryism, or libertarian anarchism whatever you want to call it is our Overton window.  Collectivists shit their pants at the idea and I love it.
Not sure why there's so much hate for Priebus. I think he's done a fine job. He secured huge wins in 2014, way better than anyone expected. He hasn't been unfair to Trump and has been completely neutral. He even banned National Review from the debates when Trump asked. And I agree with him. We need to unify the party. That's the only way the Democrats and their toxic identity politics can be defeated in November.

Only liberals care about race. Conservatives care about individual hard-work. 

Liberals want to shape this as a racial narrative, because they depend upon the victim-minded.

The simple fact is, conservative ideas are objectively superior. Individual freedom is objectively superior to government management. 

All are welcome.
[deleted]


If anyone thinks liberals are all for diversity and all that stuff, look at how they behave when a minority disagrees with them.

They are diverse, if the diversity gets them votes.
They are divisive. That's the tactic -- divide and conquer. 

Disenfranchise; disemploy; sow distrust and nurture dissent. Destroy every legitimate path forward for the huddled masses, and then offer a solution: dependence on the State. 

There is only one question that actually matters, and it transcends race and creed: why should I trust the government to fix what the government broke?
&gt; The simple fact is, conservative ideas are objectively superior.

Then why is Kansas in the toilet? Why is Mississippi one of the worst states on a multitude of things?

Conservative ideas have theirs merits, a lot of them, but there is a lot of conservative ideas that are ridiculous, same as some progressive ideas. The truth exist in the middle somewhere.

&gt;Individual freedom is objectively superior to government management. 

No. People are dumb. Like really dumb. Without government to provide some guidance we end up back with kings, dictators, or anarchy. Government is far from perfect, nor should it be the nanny state, but letting individuals run wild without oversight has been a bad idea before and it would probably be the same if it happens again.
Diversity itself contains the seeds of its own destruction.  You can see it in action when you look at the area containing forced unnatural "diversity."  High crime, poverty, stress levels, etc.  
Ah, the classic defense. Blaming the victim. Why are times so tough in many red stronghold states? 

Could it be that the DoE disproportionately rewards Blue states with grants and top talent? Could it be that our globalist trade policy disproportionately impacts blue collar Americans? 

Federal policy ignores and maligns these folks, to their direct detriment. What is left behind is blight. 

Our federal policy guts education in red States, entrenching these citizens into the blue collar sector. Simultaneously, our federal trade policy whisks away blue collar jobs, handing them off to foreign nations. We've stabbed these folks in the chest *and* the back, and now you want to know why they're having a hard time?

Is that a condemnation of conservatism? Because it looks more like a condemnation of federalism. 
[removed]
&gt; Could it be that the DoE disproportionately rewards Blue states with grants and top talent? Could it be that our globalist trade policy disproportionately impacts blue collar Americans? 

None of that explains their poor education, obesity, or teen pregnancy rates. It's 2016, the sum of human knowledge fits in your pocket. No one but them stops them from learning something and finding ways to improve their socioeconomic standing in a global world. 

&gt;Federal policy ignores and maligns these folks, to their direct detriment. What is left behind is blight. 

So don't bemoan them for taking welfare.

&gt;We've stabbed these folks in the chest and the back, and now you want to know why they're having a hard time?

The federal government isn't stopping people from reading books and educating themselves. The federal government didn't say - don't try and recruit technology jobs - you gotta stop trans people from using bathrooms - keep being racist. 

Perhaps if the fed did step in harder to improve education, things might be better for them. But you just can't seem to educate bigotry out of some people - ca sera sera.
Do you feel like you've just made any good points?

Edit: just a downvote. Guess you do feel that way. 

Okay.

So, it's okay to systematically deny middle America educational opportunities, because smartphones?

If it was that simple, every developing nation on earth would now be as wealthy as the United States. Why don't those poor Chinese factory workers just watch some more Khan Academy.

Could it be that in fact statism can and does entrench folks in cyclical poverty?

Either you believe that, or you believe that folks willfully choose to live in desperate poverty. Which sounds more plausible?
He can't even drop out or then Trump gets all of Ohio's delegates due to state rules and the race is completely over. Think the power Kasich holds now.
Wait?  Is that true?  Source. Please.
I'm a conservative Democrat and hate what the party has become.  I've been told by some democrats, especially the younger ones that I am not a real Democrat.   I feel there should be some safety nets for the people and corporations are not looking out enough for their employees.  The identity politics of the the new democrats is going to fracture the party.  Not every democrat wants to open the border or recognize the latest 50 genders.  Because I object to having to pay for all the special snowflakes, I am labeled a bigot or racist.  
I'm all for allowing people to be whatever they want but I have objections to using tax payer money on it.  I love to fish but I don't expect society to have to buy me a boat and fishing tackle.  
Why are you getting so worked up? We should only be worried about immigration, foreign policy, borders (or lack of), and upholding the constitution. Any candidates opinions on anything else don't really matter. If they have a policy for it, that's a different story.
Wait. Is this really happening? In the states? For voicing their opinions or ideas? Please don't tell me this is true.
She's hiding some shekels
Him, but you can actually just watch his speeches and interviews. It is not like he tries to hide his lying. He doesn't care if anyone notices
&gt; Liberal, by definition and as used in most other western countries, is basically Libertarian, or what a lot of Republicans really are.

Traditionally? Perhaps. I'd buy an argument that around when the country was founded, most "liberals" (Thomas Jefferson, et al) fit the modern Libertarian categorization better than either modern liberal/conservative groups.

However, liberalism in most other western countries is significantly *more* economically liberal and supportive of socialistic platforms than Americans are. That's why you see most western countries with universal health care, heavily subsidized or free tertiary education, stronger government regulation (on both businesses and things like guns). 
Though, many independents and moderates buy into their narrative. 
If you're in a rigged game, the only way to win is not to play it. Republicans could have outmaneuvered the Dems years ago if they'd had the balls for it. We're seeing just what it looks like now with Trump leading Republicans on the offensive for the first time in a generation.

If they try to race bait, you either double down and force the conversation into the public sphere where close scrutiny will eventually destroy it, or you redefine the conversation in a way that makes them unwilling to have it.
They want power. They don't care about the public. In this situation it's dog eat dog.
Trump?  It's not just him.  [His supporters are phony too.](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/4gadwi/head_mod_of_rthe_donald_demods_3_mods_moments/)
What are you talking about? Ted Cruz lies constantly. You'd have to deliberately ignore his speeches and interviews to not notice. 
Trump lies almost exclusively.  He and his followers are beyond truth and sit firmly in ends-justify-the-means territory.
OK. Can you give me a source for that claim? Convert me pls
Somehow, I suspect that will be a waste of time.  But just for argument's sake, let's find out.

Trump is constantly making stuff up, whether it's about "thousands of Muslims" celebrating 9/11 in the streets of NJ or simply claiming that TV hosts who want nothing to do with him routinely beg him to come onto their show.  Even his fans acknowledge his BS, if they're smart.  See Scott Adams for one example of that.
Their lies the problem. So many people feel entitled to have everything handed to them. Special snowflakes the most because they're special. Its not just the new generation either, its anyone that is willing to take advantage of the system because they're lazy and dont want to work for their share in life.
I personally found the concept of two candidates working together to defeat another candidate hilarious.

That said, Kasich recently announced he was vetting potential Vice Presidents and then this happens.  I am pretty okay with a Kasich/Cruz ticket as long as Cruz is in the second slot.  Kasich has the broadest appeal and Cruz ensures the conservatives stay energized and don't "riot".
Google Kamala Harris
This isn't true. Kasich can suspend his campaign and keep his delegates. 
"One-State Kasich" 
Are you not bothered at all by the fact that neither can win, and their only purpose is to stop the popular candidate from winning and subverting the will of Republican voters?

Ted Cruz: "We the People can suck my d***"

John Kasich: "Only I can beat Hillary Clinton, because no one cares enough about me to point out that from 2001-2008 I was rewarded for screwing over my country with a bank job paying half a million a year, despite having zero experience and a political science degree"
I think the Koch brothers showed their true colors when they suggested they might prefer a democratic candidate.  This election is about keeping the uber-rich in charge, not about 'We the People' choosing the direction our country should take.
I understand and respect if you aren't a Trump fan, that's your opinion and that's fine(I wasn't a fan of Romney in 2012), but can you honestly sit comfortably and watch two people mathematically eliminated from winning try and stop the clear frontrunner? Also, you aren't going to end up with a Kasich/Cruz ticket. You'll end up with a Paul Ryan ticket of some sort.
one in thirty-eight.  Charlie Koch figures the other 37 will vote for him in November.
[removed]
Basich.
Why they would opt for a strategy that only reinforces Trump's narrative is bewildering. Do they think Voters will respond to this any better? Voters aren't *complete* idiots.
Well, I suppose Mr.Koch *would* prefer a candidate he knows he can buy. He has a lot of experience in that area.
Only partially, I've accepted it because if trump can't overcome this he won't overcome getting the needed electoral college.  trump terrifies me and I would do anything to not see him as a nominee 
So if he can't overcome being attacked by Democratics and Republicans he can't win when fully supported by the Republicans?  Don't you think the fact that he has 50% of Republican voters backing him despite having 90% of the Republican establishment trying to block him shows that he has exactly the kind of charisma that would win the election if the RNC, Fox News, Romney, and everyone else would just get behind him instead of standing in his path?

Get on the Trump train, or get run over.  Kasich's hopes died three months ago.
Literally who?
We need Hastert to endorse a candidate to give credibility
It's only 50 if he gets the nomination that's it end of story
It's 50%, with **2 opponents**, and with outright sabotage from many at Fox News and most of the RNC despite leading by a long shot.  This is a Cinderella story... no candidate in modern history has pulled off an upset like this.

You're right.  If he gets the nomination it's the end... of Hillary Clinton.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that he hasn't spent any money compared to the two losers.
I used to like those guys...now, seems they're not so nice

Ted Cruz is a mess
Riveting analysis.  It's a comfort knowing we have voters like you around.
[deleted]
I really can't believe he made it as far as he has... he should be proud, he over-performed given he is how he is. You can't always compare people directly, that's why we have two different types of Olympics, a special one for the people who, despite incredible effort and heart, could never compete directly with others.
You mean the candidate who has received only about 40% of the vote? Claiming a plurality represents "the will of Republican voters" suggests a definition of "will" not grounded in reality.
Yes, I am fine because no candidate is eliminated until the convention chair announces the nominee.
You're assuming support not in evidence.
No.
She is a complete doucebag.

Ted Cruz absolutely owns her.  Gotta hand it to him, well played.
When there are 17 candidates, 40 percent is pretty damn impressive.  Doesn't matter, voters hate cruz and kasich. Tram them together and they are just twice as hated. 
Talk to me in June. 
What other Republicans have pointed this out?  This is conservatism in a nutshell - instead of handing out money we're going to create jobs. 

I haven't followed politics for long, but have been conservative since high school based on this simple point and I've never heard anyone use this against the Left and their racist bullshit. 

&gt; In perhaps the most in-depth economic discussion of the entire presidential campaign, Cruz not only showed his mastery of free-market economics, but also an incredible knowledge of the economic history of America, rattling off facts and figures from several decades to explain what policies work and which ones have turned out to be disastrous, while announcing that economic growth would be his number one priority as president because that one result solves so many of the nation’s problems simultaneously.

Yeah ok.  This is a ridiculously stupid puff piece and deserves no 'analysis'.  Straight post the video if you want anyone to watch it.

The video is fine, but Cruz didn't get into any specifics.  Nor did he 'rattle off facts and figures'.  It was a paid infomercial with lots of typical R softballs about growth and lowering taxes/regulation.

I really don't know why.  We're Americans.  We need to jobs and we need to make ourselves strong.  The liberal divisiveness has destroyed black communities and conservative values is what will fix it.

Is it rules or is it just so that they don't jump the gun?
I think it is rules to prevent a candidate from gaining an edge.
True or not, that doesn't change the fact that the comment I replied to is completely worthless.  And besides, it's hypocritical of you to say that.  You people vote up all kinds of trash in your shrine sub.

Rand Paul did. In 2013. 

But it appears that while black unemployment is still higher than white unemployment, at least tree years ago, it's actually closer under Obama than previous administrations. 

http://www.factcheck.org/2013/12/rand-paul-obama-black-unemployment/

It's also been argued for a long time that Democrats aren't trying to help black communities, but are basically bribing blacks to vote for them. The argument goes that instead of doing things to help these communities get better, the hand outs are coming so easily that there is no incentive to make things better. In fact, some people will say that the policies of Democrats (local, state, and federal) have contributed to the decline of black communities more than the supposedly-racist policies of Republicans that "target" minorities. Democrat policies see everything as statistics and just want to put a band aid on the problem. Republican policies want to address the issues and the people, but go slower to see changes actually occur. Certainly that is a broad generalization of both sides, but Trump is far from unique is his position. 
Das Racist. 
&gt; If you even remotely consider Hillary Clinton as someone who would benefit America as President, it's obvious that you are immune to reason.

Not true at all. If you are unable to look at Trump without questioning *him* as the problem in that scenario - then perhaps it is *you* who is immune to reason.
[deleted]
&gt; Then you aren't a republican, why are you here? 

To speak reasonably to others, look for some insight and witty banter perhaps... But mostly to discuss my opinions with others. I find that leads to a better understanding of both my positions and the positions of those I disagree with.
Ok. Who are you backing?
Fair enough
I do agree, Bush is gone and never coming back. Even he gave up on defending himself.

But it is no coincidence that the minute the GOP tossed him under the bus they stopped winning nationally.

If the party wants to concede, and run with a  "The *last* republican president really sucked - so vote for *this* republican president!" Platform... the "Sure, we supported it from 02-08, but when the polls started to turn in 06 we began to bail and then when the market crashed we realized how dumb we were!" platform... expect to see few voters in the middle jumping to your side.

The Republican party is the party of Trump today, because they are the "We hate W" crowd. But there already is a "We hate W" party in the US. And in 2008, or 2012, or 2016... Why vote for "We hate W" party-lite when you can get the real DNC thing!
I liked Bush, but it's true Trump and many other supporters don't.

That may be something DNC agrees with, but after that the similarities aren't really there.  DNC is all about raising taxes and giving it all to the poor/jobless.  Trump is slashing taxes to the point where over 50% of Americans won't even owe income tax.  He is also cutting business taxes so companies stop moving overseas and costing us jobs.

Added to that things like the famed "wall" to stop rampant illegal immigration, repealing Obamacare, trade reform with other countries, 2nd amendment rights... He has a very clear republican platform.

If you supported Bush but you won't for one of the R candidates, I don't really see how would have anyone to vote for at all.  I hope you have looked past the media portrayal of Trump, unfortunately it takes some digging to get past the spin.

I'm not sure yet.  For now I'm just going to try and sit back and watch.  I suppose you could say I'm for whoever can beat Clinton.  but, I'm not in favor of Kasich backdooring everyone.  And I'd see his nomination as being unable to beat Clinton, because of voter backlash.  If they are actually thinking of Changing rules and going to a brokered convention, they better pick a great one. Because if they don't there will be people voting all over the place.
&gt; If they are actually thinking of Changing rules

Yeah. I don't support changing any rules mid way either.

The rules were what they were at the start. If you had to win at least 8 states, then you had to win at least 8 states.
&gt; That may be something DNC agrees with, but after that the similarities aren't really there.

I suggest to you that the inability to distinguish your party from the DNC is the problem. The similarities do go on. In what way is the foreign policy being described that is at all different (or responsible) than Obama's foreign policy? There is no difference... exept Trump promises that when he is president we will win so much we will be sick of winning... a really funny joke - but again, not so funny I'd vote for him. And in the long run all he says is "We will bomb the shit out of them, Trust me." Well, the "Let's bomb the shit out of them" strategy since 2011 has destroyed the region, created ISIS, created no democracies, and there is no end in sight.

&gt; Trump is slashing taxes to the point where over 50% of Americans won't even owe income tax.

This is *exactly* a DNC pitch. Again, when unable to distinguish between the DNC and GOP positions, why would a person choose the GOP when the DNC has said it longer, louder, and more consistently. I'd be happy to see a citation on what you mean. To be frank, when you say that all I hear is Trump saying "WINNING!" and I don't believe there is any actual plan to do what you are saying.

&gt;Added to that things like the famed "wall" to stop rampant illegal immigration, repealing Obamacare, trade reform with other countries,

still sounds like "WINNNING" to me. I'd be happy to see any inks you want to provide that show how he makes mexico pay for a wall, or china send back jobs.

&gt;He has a very clear republican platform.

No. He has a very clear populist platform. In my opinion, he will change like a weather vane.

&gt;I hope you have looked past the media portrayal of Trump, unfortunately it takes some digging to get past the spin.

It's Trump's portrayal of Trump I can't get past.


&gt; I don't really see how would have anyone to vote for at all.

I agree. That is where I am. That is why I'll vote 3rd party - or maybe Hillary. I literally have no one in the GOP I like...

It's why I made this post.
And until the GOP says that, they will continue to lose the White House.
I've spent 4 years in r/neutral politics, r/politics, and r/moderate politics supporting Bush, McCain and Romney.

I have no idea what you saw to develop your opinion, but I have never one time said "Feel The Bern" or "Hope And Change" or "I'm Ready For Her" and tried to convince others to vote for the DNC.

Seriously, what did you possibly read to lead you to that opinion?
&gt;Hillary shill faggot.

Thanks for providing a great example of the kind of person I want nothing to do with.
&gt; So you would rather have Hillary or Sanders? 

Than Trump? Or Cruz? At this point, if I was forced to choose I'd say yes. Luckily there is probably a third party I will vote for.

&gt;If you are for no one, left the GOP, why are you posting these diatribes? Seems cunty.

Actually, calling me a cunt seems cunty. Telling people in the GOP that they are backing the wrong horse seems like the right thing to do. You are right. I can just go home and not say a word. But that seems much more cowardly to me. Why would I do that? What do I care if you call me a cunt, or some other douchebag calls me a Hillary Shill? Nah. I prefer to tell the people in my party they lost their minds for backing a clown like Trump.


And on top of that, that rule was put in place right before the convention after a primary season.
I doubt they would have the balls to change that. I think all that talk has been the Trump and Cruz people shining a light on it... Which I would do if I was them too... But I can't see the GOP changing that rule.
Sorry if this has been shared, didn't see it, thought it was interesting. 
&gt; Obama has done nothing for African-American people

well, I don't want a president doing special carve outs, especially here, would be based on race.  me black, you black, you get stuff = that sucks

however, Obama is and has been a super jerk on jobs overall so we all get screwed
There are many reasons I could never vote for Clinton, but the biggest is her desire to have taxpayers fund abortions for women that can't afford them.  Ugh.
Not really though: http://youtu.be/cieZB0Ab7xk
sorry, I already voted for Trump (Florida)
[removed]
Cruz is mathematically eliminated. Might as well bring in Jeb and Rubio and have all the mathematically eliminated candidates debate as well.

sorry, I already voted for Trump (New York)
The garbage can where he belongs.
Going to be interesting to see how this plays out in the media.  This is the kind of stuff he does a lot.  He says something borderline controversial, the media eats it up for two weeks, he gets two weeks of free publicity, and eventually people understand that the intention of the comment is deeper than they realized.

The truth is that besides the fact that her presidency would be revolutionary and the first if it's kind, there remain very few redeeming qualities about her.  She's under federal investigation, she's got decades of Washington scandal and baggage attached to her, her policies are essentially a continuation of the status quo and the status quo isn't doin it.  


It has been shared, and it was also shown to be an outright lie. 

Jehovahs Witnesses aren't allowed to vote or do anything even remotely political. He stated in an interview that he follows those rules. 
No way. He gained a few delegates tonight and is catching up to Rubio.
The denial is strong in this one.
[deleted]
I would rather see Cruz drop out first. He makes the party look worse.
He won't drop out until the final stop on his "Diners Drive-Ins and Dives" tour in Cleveland
Daddy Soros won't let him
....rubio has been out for over a month and still has more delegates than Kasich. I hope this post was more joking then serious. 
&gt; So, it's okay to systematically deny middle America educational opportunities, because smartphones?

The federal government isn't stopping anyone from reading a book to improve their own minds.

&gt;Either you believe that, or you believe that folks willfully choose to live in desperate poverty.

People are unwilling to help themselves if it requires much effort or hard work. Blaming the government for your short comings is about as lazy as you can get. No one but you is stopping yourself from trying to improve yourself. It's a fact most people stop reading books after high school. That speaks volumes about Americans.

I've met far too many people who think they are too good for education...and they wonder why their lives suck.
No way! He's got an upcoming interview with Megyn Kelly. [It'll take place during dinner.](http://nedroid.com/comics/2011-01-21-beartato-cooldate.png)
It was time he dropped out back in February. His ego won't let him.
Wooosh. 
Trump has run a populist, anti-establishment campaign from the beginning, and to great effectiveness.
"That's my secret, Captain, I'm always hungry." 
Also if he drops out, Trump gets 40 ish Ohio delegates, according to Ohio Law
B-b-but Cruz is anti-establishment! He leads a grassroots program!
Yeah, that's true.  And a good thing too, otherwise Trump might be the nominee, which would be a complete disaster.
Yet Cruz is steadily getting 3rd place in the Northeast.
There's your sign. 
I don't hate Cruz but he needs to stop with the anti-establishment crap. It's blatantly just wrong when he tries to curry favor with people by saying Washington is against him when insiders are clearly supporting him in large numbers.
Washington IS against him.  How can you deny that, when McConnel and his pal Hatch demand apologies from Cruz before they offer him any support, which Cruz has refused to do?
From the article...

&gt;"We have lots of different views but come from the same principles. The principle for tax reform is get the cronyism out of the code, give people more power, lower rates, make us more competitive for faster growth of the and on health care, put the patient in charge," Ryan said. "Let she and her doctor be in charge of deciding their health care. Give people more choices, more insurance competition. And I believe these principles when applied to this problem offer better solutions. And I think, again, whoever one of these three become our nominee, I think they're going to be comfortable with this. So I'm really not that worried about it."
That's a beautiful thought bomb. My god, that's like, the neutron bomb of take downs.

It's like bringing a flame thrower to a knife fight. 
The public doesn't appreciate being gamed, especially now that Trump's corruption narrative has gained traction. I doubt this will work well for them in Indiana.
For starters, that's just two guys.

For the appetizers, Cruz has literally doubled HILLARY in PAC funding received from Wall Street Donors, which doesn't happen without insider deals.  http://i.imgur.com/YcFfSM2.jpg

For the entree, Cruz has been in the establishment for a long damn time, even being an intern for GWBush 

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/jeb-bush-george-bush-donors-ted-cruz-214933

He frequently has been involved in pushing through corporate favoritism at the expense of the government,

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/opinion/the-brutalism-of-ted-cruz.html?_r=0

He defended John Boehner 

http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980602&amp;slug=2754000

He represented Pfizer

http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/09/huge-mother-jones-scoop-cruz-was-an-attorney-with-clients/

Re-Authorized the PATRIOT Act

http://rare.us/story/ted-cruz-who-voted-to-reauthorize-the-patriot-act-jabs-rand-paul-over-the-nsa/

And don't get me started on the man's wife.

For dessert, let's just look at the insider support in Wisco and Colorado. Neither one of these states were winner take all and had their caucuses replaced by a strawpoll significantly smaller than the voting population. In Colorado, 6000 people determined that Cruz would have gotten 97% of the vote, which is just egregious statistically. http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/26/colorado-gop-chair-were-not-redoing-our-primary-caucuses/

Then in Wisconson, Cruz walks away with all of the delegates despite the fact that the state is NOT winner-take-all and Cruz was only up 5 points before the primaries were effectively canceled.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wi/wisconsin_republican_presidential_primary-3763.html

The establishment is literally bending over backwards to help Cruz out, and Cruz has had his hands in establishment politics for a long time. Once upon a time, he might have truly not been a part of the establishment. But, for better or worse, they have adopted him and are giving him large advantages, meaning he really can't hold his anti-establishment moniker high without some light scrutiny being able to pierce through it.

EDIT: Guess you have plenty of time to post little one liners on Conservative but can't deal with a real argument when it shows up.
so Ryan is trying to muscle in credits for agreeing (he claims) ???
There is an old saying that if you are being run out of town by a mob, get in front and pretend it is a parade.
:-)
&gt; He makes the party look worse

did you see Cruz in **Indiana** (home of intense basketball) he called a basketball hoop "the ring"?
Hasn't enrollment dropped at that campus?
did you guys see where Cruz called the basketball hoop "the ring" ???

yup, Mr. Brilliant...in Indiana...home of Bobby Knight
I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing going into a contested convention.

I just hope after last year's abortion shooting, that Carly Fiorina defends people's right to the 2nd amendment all the way to the convention.  She would be an ugly faced hypocrite otherwise
I'm happy about this. I'd rather not have to dismantle the Republican Party if we don't have to. We're correcting old mistakes and steering the party in a better direction. I want Trump to lead the Republican Party back to sanity, not tear it apart. 
[deleted]
Why not name Kasich? Why Carly? Doesn't make any sense.
it doesn't make sense that he would do this before the convention
Just reeks of desperation, he wants to stop Trump. Oh, well. I'll just keep eating popcorn.
Good thing it looks like ted's campaign is dead.
I'm not sure Kasich would accept. He has explicitly said he isn't interested in being VP and as much of a longshot it is, it seems he still has the hopes he'll get the nod at a contested convention.
it's the ole Loser on Loser play
Two losers do not make a winner. It's so shockingly desperate.
I was a Cruz type guy. Originally Walker. Then Rubio/Cruz, then all in for Cruz. Now I don't know. ##NeverTrump for life, but I don't know. I guess Kasich for now and hope for a white knight at the convention. Holy crap. I can't live with president Clinton and I certainly can't imagine a President Trump not being a disaster. As screwed as the party is, the country may even be more screwed.
He should get a penalty flag for that.
[deleted]
at least trump is a better businessman than carly and isnt a fucking insane dominionist like cruz
You're trying to hard. I'm beginning to think you hate trump supporters more than you actually hate trump. You are obsessed, it doesn't look healthy. Maybe you should take a break for some time. The Internet can be addicting, I take breaks from time to time, perhaps you should as well. 

Shill for the high score!
Good. At least one candidate appears to want to unify the party. Ted Cruz on the other hand is on a mission from God to tear the party apart.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I'll tell you what I hate the most, you could say to the point of obsession, but it really hasn't detracted much from my every day life... just when I manage to read certain comments on reddit and listen to Donald Trump.

I've been fighting the left ideologically ever since the mid 80's, just before I reached voting age. I've grown accustomed to them using the media to lash out with tactics developed and cultivated by the likes of Saul Alinsky. This insane tendency toward the profane, unrelenting and purposefully deceptive attack reached its height between the middle of the Bush administration and the beginning of the Obama administration and continued by the current president himself.
I'm used to the left employing these kinds of tactics. But when someone who claims to be sharing my political views, and who most certainly doesn't... I mean, McCain and Romney I had disagreements with on a lot of things. But until Trump came along the candidates weren't employing the same kind of low personal attacks and empty rhetoric as the other side. Now quite literally, both ideogically and rhetorically the two 'primary' candidates no different from each other. 
I will not apologize for actively opposing a candidate who is frankly the worst of both sides - he mimics the absolute worst caricatures of a republican candidate that have been thrown at us dishonestly by the liberal media for years; while at the same time harbors many of the same beliefs as his Democratic opponent and has even given her ammunition to accuse him of hypocrisy (since he has funded and explicitly praised her in the recent past). 
I don't want to support a candidate who even now is being pursued in court under suspicion of fraud and may even be forced to testify by the time the election rolls around, or whose very idea of business is something that was rightfully imitated and mocked by the character of Biff Tannen. I don't want the lowest common denominator dictating foreign policy. Would you want a pilot on your next flight not have even bothered to even consider flight training? 
With regard to his supporters. I have absolutely no respect for people who twist themselves, as I have said ad nauseum, into mental knots trying to defend every insane thing their daddy has done. Hell, I've dealt with the stupid in my party and defended Sarah Palin because, well, I didn't think they were so ideologically malleable and peripherally flawed. I won't patronize these people any more, particularly when they're increasingly joined by the same kind of squishy buffoons who voted for Obama, as well as some of the, shall we say, fringier portions of the political sphere (you know, the kind of people the left birthed (with iron cross tattoos and white hoods, those kind). That's not a big tent I want to occupy.

EDIT: I'd like to add, far be it from me to try to ask why on an open forum, up until now give civil and gracious responses to some honest answers.  I should know better, right?
I literally said in the comment above that due to the Fiorina pick I can't support Cruz. I actually said I might be resigned to siding with Kasich. Idk what your point is since attacking both Crus and Fiorina as a response to me saying I don't support either of them is. At best your comment is irrelevant  piling-on and at worst shows a lack of reading comprehension. 

The fact that I (and apparently you, since you didn't give any reason to vote for Mr. trump) see no good alternatives does not make trump a good option, nor does it mean that I have to expect great things from him.
is Cruz sleeping with her?  I can't think of anything else for a reason
&gt; ##NeverTrump for life, but

oh pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease.  get some oxygen, quick
Give me 1 good verifiable reason to support trump that doesn't include a single negative thing about anyone else. The only one I can come up with is that he has been a successful businessman. That's a good achievement but doesn't really apply all that directly to government. Just as I wouldn't assume a governor would be an excellent CFO of a Fortune 500 company, I can't assume the owner of a major corporation would make a good political leader. 

The only issue I truly believe he is both correct on and capable of making progress (compared to Hillary) I support is gun rights. I dislike Hillary as much as many and more than most, but I'm not spending my time and money supporting a candidate who I don't rust on life/choice, I don't trust on tax policy, I don't trust on foreign policy, has never proven he can work with a legislative body long term, and I find to be bombastic if the best argument for trump is what I think it is. That being, he might beat Hillary and won't come for my guns. 

His supporters failure to understand how meaningless bilateral trade imbalances are in a globalized world and how treaties work is also a turn off for me. Long story short, it seems I'm better off putting my time, money, and effort into down ballot races and hoping they can thwart any liberal efforts for 4 years. Maybe at that time a true conservative, who isn't too-ever-by-half like most of this crop was, will take over the party.
They should let students into the room one by one to tease them out before letting the next one in.
&gt; 1 good verifiable reason to support trump

come on man.  how about **SAVE America.  Putting America First**

if it's online, last night's Greta Van Susteren Town Hall says it all

America is on it's knees, broke, defamed, vulnerable and keeps slipping

the majority, we the people who who will elect Trump, will do so to **SAVE America** from the politicians and the current path they have created
Do you mean the supporters of the protesters? Could you clarify for me please?
How? Specifically how. What parts of US Code will be changed and how will the changes be pushed through a divided congress? Or will this all be done through extra-constitutional dictat? Where will the money for his plans come from? How will he deal with the increase in the cost of labor (and therefore all goods and services) created when millions of illegals are replaced by Americans making minimum wage, which is generally $1-2/Hr more than illegals work for? If it just leads to basic inflation (best case scenario)  how will he combat tax bracket creep?What happens if other countries enact retaliatory tariffs in response to our combating their currency manipulation? Governance is not just about making policy, it is also about  dealing with and predicting reactions to policy. As trump admits, the rest of the world isn't stupid why would they go along with things that don't benefit them. If we abandon our skies in Europe and east Asia why won't they just run to China and Russia for protection? 

Good policy is like good doctoring. The first rule is Do No Harm.

EDIT: The questions where rhetorical, I know most political observers don't have answers to them, and have no reason to. I'm just illustrating the issues I have with him. 
Watching the Cruz campaign is like watching a rat drown in slow motion.   

All of a sudden Jeb! doesn't seem so bad. 
It's amazing that a two minute video gets downvoted within thirty seconds of getting posted.
Ann Coulter's book, Demonic covers this in great detail. I highly recommend it.
It's almost like someone is paying people to downvote.
I'll consider that.
i dont appreciate youre attitude and your reading too much into it. im saying if you could have supported cruz in the past then trump should be a breeze. if you want positive reasons to vote for him then do youre homeworke
I'm thinking you messed these up on purpose but here's an example of their correct use: You're a supporter of your candidate, but the candidate you call yours may not be who you're hoping he is.

 Cruz is a brilliant lawyer with years of government experience. He is personally distasteful but no reasonable person could question his conservative credentials or his policy knowledge. I now question his political acumen, and won't support a candidate destined to lose so I tagged out after the VP decision.    It's a 3-legged stool. Electability, competence, and policy positions. crus just cut off one leg. Trump may have one leg. If you view the electorate from a certain point of view he is electable, but there's no way to know how competent he will be working within the system or what he actually thinks when it comes to specific issues.
i question every policy he has because of his dominionism. his record on the senate is shameful and harmful to our country and the party. #nevercruz has way more reasons than #nevertrump
You know people said the same thing about Kennedy. That the evil unamerican Catholics can't be trusted and will ruin our country. Religion is a portion of a man's ideology but it's not the only, or even most important thing. Disqualifying a man from office because of the faith he holds is truly unamerican. [check this out](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Religious_Test_Clause) it's from an obscure text that Trump isn't really a fan of, but some people think it still should have some validity.
do you even know what dominionism is? comparing catholicism with dominionism is just stupid. would you let a branch davidian in the white house? what about jim jones? thought not. that clause is not obscure and says nothing about not VOTING (you invoke fallacys) for people who hold insane, undemocratic, and dangerous religious views. take youre false equivocation and go home

by the way his voting record is reason enough to hate him not to mention his personality or personal life or public actions not to mention his insane religious views

at least use google next time before embarrassing youreself (maybe learn what a fallacy is too)
And she's an alternative?
I don't care if  David Koresh(sp?) himself was running for presiden. If the policies he advocates are sound how he chooses to worship his God, or himself, are no concern of mine. To the average mainline Protestant in the 40s and 59s, I guarantee their views on Catholicism were quite strong. Probably just a strong as yours on Dominionsim. 

Obviously the obscure comment was sarcastic... Most people on here would have read the constitution at least once. It's  like 9 pages cover to cover when you print it on copy paper. My point was that if in the 18th century our founding fathers didn't see fit to bad people from office based on religion, using it as a consideration now seems a bit backward. It is certainly your right to not vote for him based on religion, but it's no different than saying I won't vote for a Jew, or a black, or any other group. 
She's his VP selection as of yesterday.
The protesters. You get your usuals that you know there and you let a few new people in at a time. If they arent carrying protest stuff with them and seem reasonable they likely are. I wasn't there so i don't know how long it took them to start protesting but from the internet stereotypes they trigger easily.
you know whats truly unamerican? voting for someone who would intentionally violate the values of this society

your missing the point. its not about banning people from office (what orifice did you pull that from?) its about not VOTING for unamerican idiots who kick and scream and moan and harm the country when they dont get their way. again get youre fallacys out of here. are you trying to tell me that someones religious views wont affect their policy? if not then this is a valid consideration for VOTING not eligibility

i cant believe you even ever considered voting for the embodiment of everything that is wrong right now with our party

#nevercruz
Congrats, you convinced me not to support Cruz. Exactly where I started all this. With advocacy like this I see trump doing very well for himself in the general should he get through a convention.
keep the cuban out
I have supported Trump from day 1 as I want someone successful at work and family that I can look up to.  I am still not sure at this point how much of what Trump talks about is going to get done.  

Part of it is the number of liberals in unelected government positions and the rest is how much will the Republicans fight Trump?

It seems to me the party was fine letting Obama get into office and pass obamacare.  If the Republicans truly don't care who is in office then they'll be fighting Trump all the way.  

We need to give Trump negotiating leverage and that means more delegates now and that means continuing to push and support him in the party over the next 8 years.  The election is just the first battle.  If we are there with Trump working within the party then he can lead it back to sanity.

The video is about how racial diversity means that Republicans can't win. The narrator used the term "colored people" at one point. 

You know, Republicans could try to appeal to all Americans. They could create policies that provide opportunities for everyone including non-white people. Paul Ryan talks like he wants to bring positive change for all Americans. After the collapse next November, I hope people like him take control and work for the betterment of the whole country.
Honestly, they should stop calling themselves liberals. They're not. Progressives and ACTUAL Liberals who follow liberal principles are as different from each other as religious fundamentalists and libertarians are on the right. A progressive is someone like these buggers, a liberal is someone like Christopher Hitchens or Steven Fry.
she's a business loser and business/investment people know all about it.  it's the Cruz people who simply can't/won't see that this is desperation and a Loser on Loser play by Cruz
Let's just say that progressives are the ones trying to change the country and make it socialist. Liberals are the whatever sex you identify as today type morons. They guys you mentioned are or were behind it though and when you talk about people like them they are the worst of the worst. Both progressive and liberal.
There are also liberal republicans so don't get the two confused.
I enjoy the fact that these two will be wiped off the political map in a matter of weeks. 
I don't like hillary.  I don't like Bernie.  But Boehner nailed it when he said Cruz is Lucifer.  He is pure evil, and the kind of evil that cloaks itself in religion... the worst kind.
Not only that (I absolutely love the Boehner quote and Boehner is a good guy) but the freshman senator is dangerously inexperienced and naive to think he can be the POTUS.
I think you have you're definitions a little confused. Liberals are left-libertarians, they care about freedom of expression, free markets, civil rights, and secular governments. They also have a penchant for following facts and evidence. If someone does not follow all of these principles, they are not a liberal. Hitchens was in fact a socialist when he was younger, but changed his positions when he got older.

Progressives on the other hand are left-authoritarians, they are against free expression for those who disagree with them, they usually believe in some form of socialist economy, and they desire to lessen civil rights for males and white people. They believe more in emotion then facts and evidence.

The difference between liberals and progressives is as stark as the difference between John Locke and Karl Marx, and I hope you can understand the difference.

eh, he is just playing a role.  I'm simply upset that the Republican party can't generate an actual leader.  It is beyond embarrassing to me that I've supported such incompetence.

"try anything" as in reach 1237 delegates after the first vote fails?
[deleted]
I'd like to see how that happens. 

In the meantime, while you're waiting for the convention, here are the convention rules to brush up on:

https://gop.com/convention-facts/?convention_type=rules&amp;pgtype=simple&amp;utm_source=google_ps&amp;ad_flight=apr_16&amp;utm_medium=ad&amp;utm_content=GO_CON_d_0_0_0

Especially the part where it says delegates vote on the nomination rules.

https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-static-ngop-pbl/docs/Rules_of_the_Republican+Party_FINAL_S14090314.pdf

&gt;RULE NO. 40

&gt;Nominations

&gt;(a) In making the nominations for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States and voting
thereon, the roll of the states shall be called separately in each case; provided, however, that if there is only one candidate for
nomination for Vice President of the United States who has demonstrated the support required by paragraph (b) of this rule, a
motion to nominate for such office by acclamation shall be in order and no calling of the roll with respect to such office shall be
required.

&gt;(b) Each candidate for nomination for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States shall
demonstrate the support of a majority of the delegates from each of eight (8) or more states, severally, prior to the presentation of
the name of that candidate for nomination. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these rules or any rule of the House of
Representatives, to demonstrate the support required of this paragraph a certificate evidencing the affirmative written support of
the required number of permanently seated delegates from each of the eight (8) or more states shall have been submitted to the
secretary of the convention not later than one (1) hour prior to the placing of the names of candidates for nomination pursuant to
this rule and the established order of business.

&gt;(c) The total time of the nominating speech and seconding speeches for any candidate for nomination for President of
the United States or Vice President of the United States shall not exceed fifteen (15) minutes.

&gt;(d) When at the close of a roll call any candidate for nomination for President of the United States or Vice President of
the United States has received a majority of the votes entitled to be cast in the convention, the chairman of the convention shall
announce the votes for each candidate whose name was presented in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this rule.
Before the convention adjourns sine die, the chairman of the convention shall declare the candidate nominated by the Republican
Party for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States.

&gt;(e) If no candidate shall have received such majority, the chairman of the convention shall direct the roll of the states be
called again and shall repeat the calling of the roll until a candidate shall have received a majority of the votes entitled to be cast
in the convention.

Bookmark it. By reading this you'll already be more informed than Donald Trump.

If you cared about right and wrong so much, you wouldn't be defending Donald.

Indiana is Tuesday and that may close the door
[deleted]
Yeah. Changing the rules after the process is nearly complete a) isn't Ted's doing and b) is, how you say, cheating? That word seems to be in the tip of Donald's tongue a lot. With that and numerous reports of threatening and intimidating delegates, I'd say projection is one of his glaring weaknesses. Projection to cover for ignorance? Keep defending him and show us who not only doesn't know, but doesn't bother to learn.
At what point in the last 10 years have Republican candidates bowed down to the left?
[deleted]
"Fair and transparent" - quit excusing this! It's perfectly transparent - I just linked to it in its explicit entirety! What more are you expecting?
[deleted]
Let me word my last comment differently so you can understand it. What about the process isn't fair and transparent?

You know how they conduct playoffs in professional sports, right? Best of 7 wins, for example? If a team wins 3 games to its opponent's 0, you can't just call it a victory, pack things up and go home. You have to play to the end and win 4 games - a majority.
Not to mention, you're mentioning "right" when it comes to a private organization. You realize that the Libertarian party doesn't even ask the voters who their candidate is, right? Or that if republican rules were in place for the dem primary, Hillary would have locked up the nomination by now?

That they weren't vetted is entirely the Trump campaign's fault. Kasich, Cruz, Hillary, and Sanders have not made the same ignorant mistake. Deflecting blame won't fix the 'problem'. 

If Donald Trump ever makes it into the White House, he's going to have a tough time navigating the procedural backwaters waiting for him. Just sayin'.
geez...insane suicide pact

happens every election.  Dems come together, **R** rips itself apart
If only they'd nominate a candidate that opposed ethanol subsidies, big government, making the IRS intimidating again, high tariffs, business as usual for entitlements, and Mike Tyson! 
who is this Kaseeech person and why haven't I ever seen him before?
lyin ted? I thought they call him ted made by Mattel cruz? cos you know he looks laminated, like his made of acrylic or toy plastic  
understood, but now the critical game is BEAT Hillbag.  Trump will, others would surely fail
It [won't be easy] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/04/27/no-donald-trump-beating-hillary-clinton-will-not-be-easy-for-you/).  He'd have to overcome a -37% [favorability deficit] (http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html), including -57% among millenials, -47% among women, -65% among Latinos, -50% among African Americans, -62 among Independent voters, and white men -4%.
&gt; He'd have to overcome a -37% favorability deficit, including -57% among millenials

Rush has spoken of your numbers, Hannity too.  add in that Hillbag's negatives are about the same.  add in the millenials don't vote, but if they do, are FAR more likely to switch to Trump and abdicate to Hillbag

there's a lot of good/great news :-)
They are not the same.
Penchant for following facts and evidence? You are a leftist aren't you?
There are liberal republicans and conservative republicans. There are other types of Republicans too but that was just an example.
Not hard to see where it comes from, his father is absolutely insane.
Uh yeah, I said in the video that I was a liberal, as in left-libertarian.
Your coat has been taken. Your post will be removed.
But you just said there are liberal Republicans. Now you're saying no?
You said left libertarian not right libertarian. Stop begging.  Stop spreading lies and begin earning your right-libertarian points.
When you need felons and illegals to vote, that's not a good sign. 
Well, based on the upvoting, my opinions seem to be quite popular with Republicans. So why would you try and push away a potential ally?
I doubt it will drastically change the outcome. How many of these upstanding citizens are going to go vote?
Depends on how many freebies democrats are offering.
A lot of people with previous felonies actually do become upstanding citizens.
Won't the governor's face be red when he finds out Hillary isn't eligible to vote there anyway.
Its easy to see when you look at 2012's election. [Obama had a slight poll lead going into election day](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/va/virginia_romney_vs_obama-1774.html)
  
Romney Won with 2,270,395 votes to Obama's 2,178,391
  
In that same match-up 200k felons voting democrat could have meant the difference if only half of them voted.
  
In my personal opinion, Election debates will shape the race to be one sided. As the presumptive Nominee Trump will have a lot of tools to undermine Hillary's hypocritical record.
  
So although 200k would make a huge difference in 2012, 2016 is a different race.
  
I do feel the number and timing make it undeniably politically driven.

Learn about Hillary Clinton.  Nothing good comes from her.  I get some people not giving with Trump, but nothing good comes from the Clintons.  
Because getting fired for being gay is totally not discrimination right? Still legal in some states..... fuck Kasich 
they are there to win elections and trash **R**.  they do very well at both

Yeah I guess I'm used to this kind of treatment by now. Progressives hate me because I'm not progressive enough. Conservatives hate me because I'm not conservative enough. The only people who really tolerate me is Libertarians and MRAs.

Nope. Not in the least. People were stupid to vote Obama in just like they're stupid now. It's the same damned idiots.

And wait till I link to Stone threatening to dox delegates.
Neato. Of course, abortion is kind of a life and death thing, so I understand the passion.
Well of course, it's totally different when it's an actual campaign team member of the guy you like instead of some random guys fighting over dinner. 

Perhaps you can post that terrible Indiana poll a few more times to ease the pain.
Don't know what you're talking about, I feel pretty good right now.

Social issues should be left to the state. I'm personally against LGBT "rights" but at least I'm willing to leave it to the states. The federal government overstepped their boundaries with the gay marriage ruling.

The government has gotten too big and needs to be brought down. Trump supports states' rights, so even though I disagree with him on the tranny thing, I agree with him overall.

Should civil liberties be left to the state?
If all Democrats were as moderate as JFK and all Republicans as moderate as Reagan, there would not be so much party tensions.
Nope. At the same time, marriage is not a civil liberty.

Rinsed Penis and the GOP will not stop Trump. Deal with it.
Good thing that it's not just white men who vote Republican, then
Because we should all care about what a bunch of old racists believed in.  
Many of these issues boil down to a religious majority legislating restrictions on the minority based on their faith. 

Many states do not respect the separation of church and state. As an athiest I expect my government to make laws based on objective evidence. When the states inflict religious laws on the public my civil liberties are infringed.

Many of these social issues boil down to, I don't like group x, let's make a law for no other reason than to fuck those people.

At the very least the Saudi's were responsible. The axe is falling on them as we speak. Once the truth comes out I can't see the US rushing to aid the Saudis.

The Saudi's regime could collapse overnight if somebody had the balls to block their oil from hitting the market like the west did to Iran. As I speak the Saudis are on a path to bankruptcy.

Your liberties end where you need to compel someone to action
your list is good, but we also need to be more like Trump as a party

shoot back hard at attackers like the media EVERY SINGLE TIME and with tons of fire power until they learn daily/constant pop offs will no longer be tolerated.  wimp punks like Boehner/McConnell must be made to be embarrassed coast to coast for their liberal tolerance

further, challenge their premises, e.g. women are under paid, black live (only) matter etc.  persist the way DEems do...pound pound pound them back (like Trump)
Not very suprising. Rubio wants to stay relevant so he does interviews about the nomination and the possibility of a contested convention. Media spins some lies to get more views then "updates" the story to what Rubio meant the first time.

I agree with Rubio, if Trump gets like 1230 delegates should there really be a contested convention? No. Now if say Trump has 1100 and Cruz is somewhere from 700 to 800 maybe even 900 then yes let their be a contested convention. As a Trump supporter I recognize Trumps strategy is to win the nomination out right so if that doesn't work then its his fault. I believe after Indiana it will be over though.
This right here. 
He's oblivious, he spends a lot of time In columbus too which is one of the gayest cities in the us. How the hell did he even become governor?
He kept his crazyness in check i guess. Idk it was 4 years ago and i didnt bother to pay attention 
There's a better chance of people accidentally voting for Rubio at a brokered convention.
You Cruz supporters are so desperate.  It's sad to see, so very very sad.
This^ and to be completely honest I'd take Rubio. Have you heard Kasichs policies and opinions? They're so neoconservative that once people actually hear them his ratings will drop.
I can't wait for this. Those fucking war criminals will pay for their role in 9/11. I only wish it could be us till kill their ruling class.
We're going to beat Clinton with or without the #nevertrump people.
This is, in fact, the second such poll.

Indiana is entirely unpredictable at this point.
&gt; Learn about Hillary Clinton.

Your idea that I don't know about here is laughable.

&gt;I get some people not giving with Trump, but nothing good comes from the Clintons.

It's as if about a year ago I turned on the TV to watch the debates... and this clown with full on clown makeup, honking a horn like Harpo Marx, walks up on stage. And The GOP moderators go around the stage and ask every member on that stage to promise to vote for the GOP candidate... *no matter who it is*... and then the screen shot cuts to the clown pulling a long line of hankys out of his pocket, ending in pokadot undies... and then cuts back to the GOP canidates.... and they look dismayed but and say "Well, I don't think it will be the clown... So yes, I will."

Why the fuck there was not a single one of them with enough balls and sense to say "You don't mean the clown, right? The one who obviously shouldn't be up here?"... I will never know.

BenSavageGardenState ... is there *anyone* you would say that about? Anyone on earth?

...screen shot cuts to the clown hitting people with a pie.
What do you think he did? 
-Passed healthcare "reform" before anyone had a chance to even read it

-Allowed ISIS to secure a caliphate 

-stoked racial tensions in America (saying if he had a son he'd look like trayvon, not doing more for poor communities in Chicago, etc)

-Makes America look weak and ineffectual by undermining our allies and bowing to our enemies

just to name a few
[removed]
- Did not renew Bush tax cuts and removed ability to deduct medical expenses, causing my family to have to pay a significant amount of taxes instead of receiving a refund

- Obamacare has driven up our insurance costs significantly, and in order to offset those costs, there is a higher copay and less is paid for. In addition, my company has to pay over $2500 a year just to manage all the extra documentation.

* Did not help racial tensions in America, instead made things worse

* Dishonored Justice Scalia by not going to his funeral for no reason and dishonored the memory of Nancy Reagan to go to SXSW

* Continued to keep our military involved in the Middle East while cutting military expenses significantly

Just a few things I can think of.
[deleted]
He's legislating from the executive branch setting a precedent which both means his executive actions can be nullified and other, future executive actions can be.. executed without the approval of the other branches of government. (can you imagine if a republican president on day one said "ACA IS OVER retroactively" and not much could be done about it because Obama didn't pass the law the right way(not that this would happen, I'm not a US government scholar nor can I estimate the impact/outcome of legislating from the executive)

ACA is a handout to the insurance companies, pharmacutical companies and doesn't address (perhaps even exacerbates) the problems with our healthcare system- It is, however, a step in the right direction. I'm not sure how else we could loosen that stranglehold on our medical system. 

He's also has a notoriously opaque administration, limiting dissenting opinions. 

He is also especially hard on whistleblowers with a history of prosecution, sometimes more than against those who committed the actual crimes, and he's a lot friendlier to special interests than he campaigned on. 

The backlash against what people perceive as Obama's unfriendliness toward gun have entenched gun-laws and further divided the nation. (divisive figure)

His remarks on current events have done little to address issues and instead enflamed tensions. Though I did like his recent remarks against BLM (saying they needed to be more cogent), in general he's been a focal point of a campaign driven to hurt (and on the other hand, blindly help) anything he wants. 

Finally, and this one's on the republicans, he's been a target for obstructionism with a major political party doing everything it can to hinder or render him useless for "I told ya so" privileges. It pretty much enshrined causal, perpetual obstructionism as OK and has allowed 'business as usual' with the GOP/right creating wedge issues to keep themselves occupied and us/them mentality. Dems had a chance to remove the filibuster but declined to do so in case in the future they wanted to obstruct just as badly. 

I do think a lot of the hate against him is race-based or.. hrm, what's the word: people think they should dislike him, even though they don't have reason to, so they view all things from that vantage. A meme of divisiveness? And I'm not suggesting that that meme is justified, yet it still exists.

(I'm a progressive independent. MAGA!)
This guy admits to voting for Michael "Soros Lite" Bloomberg but Trump is somehow unacceptable and the antithesis of a conservative . I have no words for how incredibly stupid and hypocritical that is. 

This is the sort of person we don't want in the Republican party, not Trump. 
I voted twice for Obama, and will never vote for another Democrat.

1 - ACA is a deeply flawed law. It does not work and needs to be repealed or *massively* overhauled. 

2 - The United States is less secure than at any point since the Cold War. Obama has not lead the world in the battle to contain radical Islam. Iran is stronger than ever; and our allies in Europe stand poised to collapse. 

3 - Obama promised to promote transparent government, and has prosecuted more whistleblowers than any other administration in history. The battle for government transparency is now set back by decades, and may be lost forever. The next administration will follow the precedent. The American voter may never again be informed.

4 - the bailout was bad policy, and has set up the economy for an even bigger crash down the road. It is inevitable that the ghost of 2008-2009 will return to haunt us.

5 - by slashing America's military, our enemies are emboldened. Russian skirmishes and Chinese incursions prove that the balance of power is slipping away. 

6 - Obama promised to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and has not. This perpetuates a national human rights embarrassment.

7 - Obama has not meaningfully reigned in unwarranted domestic spying. This, too, is a national human rights embarrassment.

8 - Obama bungled the troop withdrawal in Iraq. The region will be destabilized for decades, and hundreds of thousands will die. 

9 - Obama has ignored our veterans. 

10 - Obama has lead the charge into petty identity politics, damaging the cohesive fabric of the American national community. We are less united today than we have been in decades. This is an abject failure to live up to his campaign promise to unify the people and bridge inroads in our national racial divide. 

11 - Obama has utterly failed to lead Congress. Congress has never been so ineffective for so long.

12 - Obama abused the IRS to target political opponents, setting a terrible precedent for future abuse.

13 - Obama's economic policy has done nothing to help the domestic worker. Wages remain stagnant; unemployment remains high. Only Wall Street cronies are doing well. 

14 - Obama has pushed TPP and TTIP, two disastrous trade agreements that will decimate America's already weakened middle class. 

15 - Obama's campaign promise to rebuild America's infrastructure is utterly unfulfilled. 

16 - Obama has waffled on much-needed immigration reform; offering no solutions and failing to lead. Our weak borders destabilize our national security. 

17 - Obama's Iranian nuclear deal is a disaster; destroying any hope that may have existed for a diplomatic solution for Israel in the region.

18 - Obama has repeatedly drawn lines in the sand and then retreated. This sends the message to extremists that America is weak. 

19 - Obama has used secret drone strikes to kill American citizens, without any due process. This amounts to a secret assassination program, and belongs in history books right next to the Gestapo.

20 - Libya

21 - The Snowden Affair, and Chelsea Manning

22 - zero meaningful education reforms; desperately needed.

23 - $29 trillion national debt

24 - Benghazi

25 - Spying on the Associated Press

26 - Fast and Furious project arms violent Mexican drug cartels. Thousands die.

27 - OPM is hacked, exposing every single federal employee with a security clearance -- only the worst of several high profile cyber assaults Obama's administration failed to prevent

28 - Eric Holder commits perjury before Congress. Twice.

29 - Hillary Clinton commits perjury before Congress.

30 - Obama funnels federal dollars into failed green energy firms. His pals get rich. America gets screwed.
Well I understand that's how you see him bro.  No worries we don't have to agree on everything. Just be careful about Hillary, she is honestly trouble.  The way Benghazi was handled was a travesty, good men died.  And her email scandal honestly isn't even being given enough attention, best case scenario it's gross negligence, worst case she could be looking a prison time.  She doesn't seem to take America's future seriously.  I know you wouldn't say you would think about voting for her lightly though.  Hopefully, for America's sake, the best person is elected. Have a good one man, thanks for the positive discussion. 
&gt; Well I understand that's how you see him bro. No worries we don't have to agree on everything.

I'm glad we agree on that. I would love to know - is there any candidate the GOP could put up that just makes you feel like I described?

&gt;The way Benghazi was handled was a travesty, good men died. 

I've been saying this on Reddit since it happened. The entire Obama Doctrine of destroying the gaddafi government and then bragging about how much money we saved by *not* helping restore order to Libya is all about Hillary too. I have no love for her at all.

But no way in hell am I saying I'll vote for the clown. I have no idea why people are saying they will.

I don't think we need to agree either, but I would ask - who would the GOP need to put up to make you feel like I do?
Love this response. I'm totally with you, voted Obama twice and am so dissatisfied by his lofty promises and failed policies that I'm not sure I will ever trust a conventional Democratic nominee.

Our country looks like shit, and I'm a little disappointed that my vote contributed to this (albeit, the opposition was pretty weak)
Are skyrocketing health insurance premiums not a legitimate complaint?
That's a really good point -- I'm still not convinced McCain or Romney would have been *any* better. 

The GOP has an opportunity now to recapture the hearts and minds of America. Let's not waste this chance.
It seems to be with the ideological purists in both parties if you don't adhere to the party line. I'm the same way as a moderate Republican being called not a "true conservative" just because I think tax cuts should stop or LGBT people should be left alone and the stupid laws that get government into their lives should be stopped.
&gt; How? What exactly do you take issue with?

exactly EVERYTHING

whatever was the right thong to do, he literally did the opposite.  on top of that, Hussein went in new directions/agendas heretofore totally unknown with our traditions and laws
But he is the first ~~bla~~African American. 
But aren't there many more polls showing trump ahead?
I appreciate you taking the time to write this response.  You raise some interesting points and I'm definitely going to dig into some reading/research to figure out exactly where I stand on all of this. 
This is so simplistic it's laughable and is exactly the kind of response I wasn't looking for.  I'm also not sure what his middle name has to do with anything.  Unless of course you think the president's middle name somehow ruined the country.
Really interesting points.  Thank you for taking the time to write this out.  
Fairly comprehensive list there, and succinct. 

I would add that under Obama, race tensions have grown. You touched on this but it deserves more explanation I believe. 

When Treyvon Martin was shot, before any facts or evidence was weighed, Obama said "if I had a son he'd look like Treyvon". It is extremely unpresidential and inappropriate for the president to insert himself into an ongoing investigation like that. It turns out that George Zimmerman (the first labelled white-hispanic) acted in self defence. 

When Michael Brown was shot, his administration sent Eric Holder to fire up tensions. Again, the investigation was ongoing and it turns out the officer did nothing wrong (even according to black witnesses). Again, highly inappropriate. 

The correct way to handle any situation, particularly one involving race relations is to urge, and even command calm. To tell everyone we have no idea the circumstances surrounding this instance, and we need to let the justice system do its work is the appropriate comment from the whitehouse. 

This president has divided Americans, particularly by race, gender, and class. I cannot think of a more divisive president in American history. And that's really saying something. 
I don't think his race has anything to do with his dissenters. If Bill Clinton had done what Obama has, or Hillary, or Carter, etc, it would be the same reaction. 
[deleted]
They leave out that Mitt Romney signed a fucking GUN BAN into law.  He should be tarred and feathered for that, if not hanged.
He humiliated our country before the eyes of the world and cost us thousands of lives and possibly billions of dollars by leading us into the disastrous war in Iraq (remember "Freedom Fries"?)  Then he oversaw the biggest financial crisis in America since the Depression.
I would like to offer a (civil) rebuttal as a fellow Republican: 

&gt; 2 - The United States is less secure than at any point since the Cold War. Obama has not lead the world in the battle to contain radical Islam. Iran is stronger than ever; and our allies in Europe stand poised to collapse.

So, a few things here:

1.  I would argue that GW Bush made us much weaker.  Under his tenure, we engaged in two costly conflicts of questionable value and undertook a misguided attempt at nation building in countries that have no tradition of democracy.  The fight in Syria today is a direct result of that.  

2.  Military leaders during the GW Bush administration argued against large-scale deployments of troops and preferred a strategy of using intelligence and precision drone/SOF strikes to take out key targets in the War on Terror.  This is the strategy Obama is taking now and it appears to be very effective without putting "boots on the ground".

3.  Under Bush, and because of the aforementioned conflicts and troop deployments, we saw the F-22, Crusader, Commanche cancelled.  Systems desperately needed today to keep up a credible conventional capability against Russia and China.  We also deferred a lot of needed maintenance and replacement of aging weapons systems leaving our military readiness at all time lows.  Obama's administration under Ash Carter is seeking to undo a lot of this and recapitalize our forces.

&gt; 5 - by slashing America's military, our enemies are emboldened. Russian skirmishes and Chinese incursions prove that the balance of power is slipping away.

As mentioned above, this was done under the GOP and Bush administration.  I was there for much of this.  We focused too much on lining the pockets of contractors to fight those past wars, we never modernized.  

&gt; 8 - Obama bungled the troop withdrawal in Iraq. The region will be destabilized for decades, and hundreds of thousands will die.

The Iraqi troop withdrawal timetables were set by the Bush administration and agreed upon by the Iraqis.  Not to mention the winding down of an unpopular war was popular with Americans (and still is).

&gt; 16 - Obama has waffled on much-needed immigration reform; offering no solutions and failing to lead. Our weak borders destabilize our national security.

How much is really his fault here?  How much deserves to be laid at the feet of Congress who wished to be obstructionist.  Obama had no real room to maneuver: he either could rule by executive fiat or just do what the GOP in Congress wanted, there was no middle ground offered IMO.

&gt; 21 - The Snowden Affair, and Chelsea Manning

How else could this have been handled?  Manning was a traitor and leaked classified data.  Snowden is also a traitor and gave away the keys to the kingdom to China/Russia.  Nothing they revealed was brand new and many of the spy programs involved were created under Republican control of the Presidency (Bush) and Congress (1996-2006)

&gt; 27- OPM is hacked, exposing every single federal employee with a security clearance -- only the worst of several high profile cyber assaults Obama's administration failed to prevent

But is this is also due to the ineptitude of the Federal Government in general?  It's hard to blame Obama when the government effectively operates on the Peter Principle.  Everyone in charge has merely reached their level of incompetence and doesn't know it.  Or is this simply an unreasonable standard?

HOWEVER, how he has treated those affected may be worth a comment: these people will be prey to hackers and thieves for the rest of their lives.  The Government at the very least, should provide lifetime ID and fraud protection... I don't see that happening though.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All in all, just some thoughts.  I agree with the rest of your points. =)
Any candidate that gives me the same feels?  I would have to say Ted Cruz man. Something about him is just so incredibly off. I dont feel like I can trust anything he says. He claims to be anti-establishment, but his wife works for Goldman Sachs.  The only person who has been paid more by Wall Street than him is Hillary.  He claims to want to represent the people, but he is willing to collude with Kasich to stop the guy who is winning the primary (by huge margins) all because he knows better than those he claims to represent. He has been mathematically eliminated but he still chooses a VP pick, and it couldn't have been much worse.  Fiorina and Cruz have awful chemistry, and she came close to destroying HP.  Shit, she fell off the stage the other day and he didnt even bother to help, and that's his partner to run the country.  He has to show more loyalty on national tv than that.   He also says he is a family man, but his family's body language screams that they are uncomfortable around him. Then there is the scandal about the mistresses, which may or may not be true, but given everything I have seen of him I wouldn't be surprised.  Heck, his wife and him didn't even live together the first seven years of their marriage. Then when she does live with him the cops find her having an emotional breakdown on the side of the interstate. I don't think he is the zodiac killer, but something about him is really scary.  I wouldn't ever vote for him.  
I don't think it's Cruz's fault he didn't help her. He wasn't looking her way at all. 

Heidi on the other hand...
Holy shit the Faux Nooz™ retardation is strong in this shitty subreddit. No wonder you clowns are an international laughing stock.
There is no way he didn’t see it happen. Unless he has a vision problem. He was turning and facing her when she fell.
Lemme look at it again then. 

Hmmm, maybe you are right! Missed that
[removed]
last three weeks, Cruz has been taking the same bad drugs Beck has been swallowing.  now Cruz ends up looking like some kind of desperation player where he could have EASILY slid in as Trump V.P.  still maybe can, but badly self inflicted wounds whacked him down down down
&gt; Any candidate that gives me the same feels? I would have to say Ted Cruz man. Something about him is just so incredibly off.

Right there with you, Buddy!

Which is why I am saying I didn't leave the GOP, the GOP left me.

&gt;He claims to be anti-establishment, but his wife works for Goldman Sachs. The only person who has been paid more by Wall Street than him is Hillary.

You don't think Trump has made a gazillion off of wall street? I mean, the guy is a NYC real estate mogul... he may be pulling his strings differently than the DC or Texas way - but the idea that Trump has no ties to wall street seems to me to be a fantasy.

&gt;He claims to want to represent the people, but he is willing to collude with Kasich to stop the guy who is winning the primary (by huge margins) all because he knows better than those he claims to represent.

I also don't understand this anger either. The primary has a very specific rule about getting the 1237 delegates to show that you are *actually* winning by majority vote. If no one gets to 1237, that doesn't mean that the person closest to it wins. It isn't cheating... that's like saying a guy who steals second base is cheating!

I have to say - you know *way* more about Cruz than I do. My issues is not all the stuff you listed, it's that he represents the Bachmans and Palins and Santorums and Huckabees of the party - who up until now were not the group that the party puts up for the presidency.

The GOP is fucked for 2016. Maybe they can make a come back, but their first step will be recovering from the Trump damage.

Better is to point out the total out of pocket expenditure for healthcare is way up. Unless someone else is paying it for you under medicaid

Cruz is having a meltdown.   He is in the death throes of his campaign.  His actions of the last few weeks reek of desperation,  he is done for.
I think Cruz said he wouldn't take the VP. Now Scotus would fit him and i think he'd take that. 
Great article
**LOL**
I especially agree with point #1. Social issues like gay marriage or trans-gender equality are not a threat to Americans and do not take away anyone's rights. In fact it is the Conservative push to prevent gays from marrying or a trans-gendered person from using a freakin' bathroom that is an action that infringes on the rights of a minority and that is not moral or what this party should stand for. 
I know many of you disagree, but the times are changing and maybe it is time for the Republican party to follow suit.

I would also add to the list, become relevant to the current times. Social media gets the young voters involved and interested. It also helps with story spin and narrative control because the attention span of the average voter is only as long as a Tweet. We *look* like an antiquated party if we cannot reach out in a modern way.  


What an intriguing viewpoint.
he should consider SCOTUS but he's lost his mind lately...so who knows
Yeah idk about it now. The way he attacks Trump I dont think he'd nominate him.
Shame on Morning Joe for facilitating this trash and laughing at it. Trumpkins are utterly fascinating because they watch this and see a completely different reality than literally every reasonable person. Disagree with Cruz? Fine. But the Fascist parallels write themselves here in how Trump supporters behave and this is just another example of what's coming as we drift toward chaos this summer. 

Today Trump did his usual driveling call-ins and speculated that Ted Cruz's father was involved with the assassination of JFK. This man is a menace to our Republic. It's a crying shame that the party has been hijacked by people utterly devoid of reason and sensibility. The GOP is about to nominate a man who believes the shit he reads in the National Enquirer. A fucking tabloid. It is utterly disrespectful to America that this man has got even this far.
Trump [supported the Assault Weapons Ban.](https://theintercept.com/2016/01/27/donald-trump-in-2000-i-support-the-ban-on-assault-weapons/)
...did you even read the article?
&gt;Now Scotus would fit him and i think he'd take that.

"Ladies and gentlemen of the senate, I give you my nominee for the highest court in the land: LYIN' TED CRUZ!"
And he has addressed his past support as not understanding what assault weapons were.  He says his sons are avid shooters and hunters/outdoorsmen.  THEY are the ones who schooled him on the fact that an assault weapon is just a semi-automatic rifle.

He has specifically stated that now that he understands what a semi-automatic rifle is and that 'assault weapon' is a cosmetic term, he would never support them being banned.

You can look this up yourself.

I myself would gladly take the word of a clear 2nd amendment convert.  Someone who was schooled on what an assault weapon is and now that they understand takes a common sense approach and supports gun rights.

***AmmoLand:***

 The deceptive term “Assault Weapons” has proven to be a buzz word among the anti-gun media. Back in 2000 in your book “The America We Deserve” you wrote “The Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse to even limited restrictions. I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I also support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun.” Since that time the AR15 rifle, what the media calls an “assault weapons“, has become America’s most popular firearm with millions and millions of them owned by good people.

**Do you still stand by this quote or has your thinking evolved over the 15 years since you wrote that line?**

***Donald Trump:***

“I certainly stand by my opposition to Gun Control when it comes to taking guns from law-abiding citizens.  You mention that the media describes the AR-15 as an “assault rifle,” which is one example of the many distortions they use to sell their agenda.  However, the AR-15 does not fall under this category.  Gun-banners are unfortunately preoccupied with the AR-15, magazine capacity, grips, and other aesthetics, precisely because of its popularity.  To the Left every gun is an assault weapon.  Gun control does not reduce crime. It has consistently failed to stop violence. Americans are entitled to protect their families, their property and themselves. In fact, in right-to-carry states the violent crime rate is 24% lower than the rest of the United States and the murder rate is 28% lower. This should not be up for debate.”


---


There is more to read on the subject about his sons, etc.  They really turned their father around and taught him about firearms, etc.  The sons are the ones to thank for converting him.

---

When John Kasich was asked if he regretted his voting for the 1994 gun ban, he said no.  He was asked in 2015.  No excuses.  Same for Romney.  
Lol he may lie about Trump but the man cares about the constitution 
Cruz holds no appeal nationally.   He is a regional candidate, and were the GOP ever to make him the nominee the electoral map would look like McCain vs Obama.   If we want to lead this country we need to break the demographic narrative established by the left, the liberal media, and our own internal limitations.

You can't blame a handful of blue collar guys for that incident.  They love their country, they love their candidate, and they only want what is best for their families.   Cruz showed terrible judgement by crossing the street just as he shows terrible judgement by staying in a race he is mathematically eliminated from winning.

It's time to unite the entire GOP into a single fist that will destroy Crooked Hillary's campaign, defend US sovereignty, and Make America Great Again!!!
"Together, we left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we've got." -Ted Cruz

Annnnnnd he's out.
All I can say is, Bush has now been out of office for nearly as long as he held it. The failures of his administration are well-known, and correctly documented. 

That is not an exoneratation. Obama has had his 8 years, too. Bush's problems are now Obama's problems. 
Likely. I just am trying to imagine Trump do that. We may see.
&gt; You can't blame a handful of blue collar guys for that incident.

You're right. But I can blame all the people peddling Trump's lies and bullshit about everything from trade to building a wall. Tell me something...in the age of Bitcoin and Crypto-currencies, how on earth does Trump think he can coerce the Mexican government into paying for that wall by holding remittance payments hostage? Is this where his "ban the internet" nonsense comes into play? I'll wait.
&gt; He humiliated our country before the eyes of the world and cost us thousands of lives and possibly billions of dollars by leading us into the disastrous war in Iraq (remember "Freedom Fries"?) Then he oversaw the biggest financial crisis in America since the Depression.

The OP asked why /r/republicans thought *Obama* screwed up our country. Both the Iraq war (2003) and Great Recession (2007) began under Bush's watch.
and it's the kind of response that triggered the sarcastic "Thanks Obama!" meme.


It will be interesting to see what happens. If I remember correctly Trump said he holds no ill will to any of the 16 other candidates that were in the race and that he understands its just what comes with the race. So its still a possibility.
To all those Ted Cruz supporters who are fearful/hateful when it comes to Trump or Cliinton, we're waiting for your reinforcements to arrive over here at /r/SandersForPresident 
I like Bernie but dude he is finished. He lost the race. Hillary only needs about 200 delegates to win the nomination and California alone has over 500 and it's a proportional race. There's a 0% chance that Bernie will win unless by the grace of God she gets indicted or something which we all know is never going to happen.

It's time to pick Hillary, Trump, or a third party candidate.

Personally I'm voting for Trump.
So your problem isn't with Donald so much as it is with the GOP base.

I'm glad we finally have a candidate in Donald Trump who represents us.
What the hell are you talking about
Trump should be the obvious choice. I encourage everybody to do real research instead of sticking to "but Fox said he's a liberal in disguise!"

Do your own research, listen to speeches like [this one]( https://youtu.be/XW8RqLN3Qao), then make your decision.
You think that Pablo who does day labor will be able to use bit coin.  Or that Abuela in Oaxaca has a way to extract it from the internet.  Classic.
And you don't think that more technical people here and in Mexico would develop a business model that turns that BTC into cash? Have you ever even used BTC?
No because I'm not an autistic thirteen year old playing v for vendetta 
&gt; But I can blame all the people peddling Trump's lies and bullshit

Your words.
...so it appears your understanding of the technology goes no further than Trump's. Okay then.
How are you interpreting that to mean that Trump represents me...?


Lol, how delusional are you? The ONLY and I mean ONLY reason people liked Cruz is because of his principles, which are the literal exact opposite of Sanders. There is literally no crossover at all from Cruz to Sanders. 


I'm not.  You may very well have been one of these 15 people:

http://prntly.com/2016/05/01/humiliated-cruz-draws-15-man-crowd-in-indiana-this-sat-empty-seats-outnumber-people/

But if you look at the picture on the right, and the tens of thousands of people who attend every Trump rally, then you can see the people you are insulting.
I'm not a Cruz supporter. And I think you're trying to intimidate me by implying that, because there are "tens of thousands" of extremely misguided and confused people supporting Trump that I will back down.

You would be wrong.
I'm not trying to intimidate you.  I'm pointing out what a jerk you are.
That's cute, coming from someone who frequents /r/The_Donald. 
I came to Reddit exclusively FOR /r/The_Donald.


Does anyone have a clip of Fiorina singing to Cruz's daughters? 

Truth stranger than fiction. 
Since she was on a microphone speaking there is no doubt that what they didn't see they would have heard.  This is last minute panic to win in high gear.  This was an awful last moment for us to remember.  Just like the video of Hillary apologizing to miners for saying she was going to destroy the industry.  They may feel vidicated, but I doubt they will trust her enough to bank on it with votes in the general. 
The best part about the NeverTrump bandwagon is that it rounds up the usual suspects into a nice tidy group for us to ignore.  
Fuck the idea of a Cruz V.P..  He'd probably kill Trump a month into the presidency just to get the top seat.
That's a damn good speech.  Spot on with his points.
He's gonna tear her apart. 
wow, hadn't thought of that.  I had considered the establishment would kill Trump, but what you say makes sense too
I love it. This is an example of him actually being Presidential. He steps up and produces effective, logical, simple plans to better this country. It's genius.
Cliff Notes Version

* Because he’s not a ‘real candidate’
* Because he’s ‘not really a Republican’
* Because he’ll be out by Iowa
* Because he ‘seriously’ won’t win
* Because everyone will laugh at you for thinking that Trump will win
* Because it’s going to be Marco Rubio
* Because he hasn’t been tested
* Because I’ll leave the party
* Because he’s finally collapsing
She should suffer in federal prison 
LOL.
Pres Putin could have read Ms Clinton's emails before her.
I really won't watch it. He had less delegates than Marco Rubio (maybe others) who had the sense of dignity to leave. He hoped to profit by slithering quietly behind the two real competitors, and be some sort of convention unity candidate, or something in that general area, a #nevertrump backup.
There is a Sanders-Trump crossover with people angry at the economic decline of middle America, big banks, NAFTA, and other hot button issues. Ted Cruz was so disliked his colleagues (remember Sen Graham saying if Cruz were murdered on the Senate floor no one would testify against the killer or the Boehner 'Lucifer' quote), but that's not really anti-establishment, just him being anti-social. Ted Cruz had an appeal among Neo Cons and a portion of Evangelical or conservative Christians. Those are people who have reason to dislike Trump over abortion inconsistencies and some big government leanings. There are really areas of common ground between Sanders and Cruz.
There would probably be 999 bad predictions, but that's a decent selection.
Suffer? No. Be held accountable for her failure to keep them classified? Yes.

I recommend a prison term, then life long probation restricting her from using electronic mail without a federal law enforcement officer present to ensure she is abiding by all laws. 
Jail is something i would categorize as suffering.. 
Best choice and likelyhood to get elected are two very different things.
&gt; There are really areas of common ground between Sanders and Cruz.

May I please get your drug dealers number? He's got you on some seriously mind altering substances.

If people are worried about their convictions in this race, the libertarians are probably no help to them.  After watching some of their debates, some of their answers made me cringe.
Forgot 'few or no' after 'really'. Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders are polar opposites, apart from very slight similarity in representing themselves as outsiders, but that's almost nothing. You'd need strong drugs to see a closeness of policy between Bernie and Ted. Should read before I post.
Rush was surprised that the NYT didn't go for Trump bashing

unlike a list of establishment Republicans...just disgusting

e.g. here in FL I changed from Independent (over 30 years in that status) to Republican registration JUST SO I COULD HELP Romney.  now look.  Romney is not going to the convention and won't endorse Trump.  WTF?
I'm not sure what the title of the post is trying to say.

I think he's trying to say that the Donald Trump Train is giving Washington a spanking. A spanking that Washington deserves. But I can't be sure. It also sounds like Donald Trump's Train was given something that is cocky, lazy and Washington. 
..and why not surrendering your firearms is an affront to the children of Sandy Hook.
TIL there's more than one person whooshing on ["Trump Train's" being a contraction for "Trump Train has"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_%28grammar%29#English) in the title.
Welcome to modern day journalism where english is hard. 
More like welcome to modern day America rife with public school victims.
thank goodness.  it was looking like President Trump would be fighting the House as well...but that still may be an issue as the establishment will fight on

also occurs to me I've always deeply criticized **R** because they wouldn't fight **D**, but that may be wrong.  it looks more and more like *establishment* **R** wouldn't fight *establishment* **D**

makes sense too.  both are the same, same goals, **KEEP THE POWER**

From the article...

&gt;Despite Clinton’s persistent lead in the polls, many of them are far from sanguine about her prospects against the presumptive Republican nominee. They view Trump’s ability to harness the anger of America’s dispossessed white working class as a powerful threat in several Midwestern swing states, especially now that he’s openly courting Bernie Sanders supporters and aping the Vermont senator’s rhetoric on trade. They worry the New York real-estate mogul’s brash, bullying campaign style could throw the easily flustered Clinton off balance, upending her campaign at a crucial moment. And they fear that a relentlessly negative campaign would turn women voters away from politics altogether, depriving Clinton of the votes she’ll need to overcome Trump’s likely advantage with white men.
isn't Morgan the guy who got fired for being UBER UBER left and no ratings?

regardless, I'm shocked at his list.  he must be trying for a come back
If Trump can make it clear how he differs Clinton re: SCOTUS the inroads should eventually be filled in.
In what ways did the republican party fail to fight Obama? I mean, they didn't Caesar him, but they shut down the govt to spite him, went behind his back to invite the Israeli PM to congress, and attempted to repeal Obamacare how many times? Legitimately, short of murdering him, how could they have fought harder?
Photoshop battles source?
Snopes mentions the elephant tail and doesn't say it's not real. 

http://www.snopes.com/donald-trumps-son-game-hunting-photos/#

And I can't find a single source saying the picture is fake. But I did find multiple references to it in several news articles about the hunt, dating back several years when it was taken originally. 
&gt; In what ways did the republican party fail to fight Obama?

**everything** Obama wanted (and sometimes) more was passed with zero push back

the one sometimes more [was the budget](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/18/democrat-leaders-dance-gloat-declare-speaker-paul-ryan-gave-away-store/).  moutains of money beyond Dem requests/expectations...geez
Trump said he'll issue a list shortly, 10-12 or so candidates.  from which one will be nominated.  plenty of time for the HATE TRUMP crowd to scream and shout and Dems to join in the yelling

I also imagine a call to Cruz asking for a couple of names he'd like added

Trump is going to crush Hillbag in the general election.  Cheatin' Hillary will be a blob of puss after Trump unleashes a proper cannonade, a barrage **R** has always been afraid to fire for fear of "offending"

1. the so-called moderates and independents
2. ...and the women
3. ...and the black vote
4. ...and the Hispanics vote
5. ...and the LGBT vote
6. ...and the...(all the rest of the media bunk)

All that PC dreck is now replaced with nuclear political attacks.  Hillbag has **NEVER** been attacked like we'll be seeing.  Come starting in September, the media theme will be **"poor Hillbag, she didn't stand a chance"**
it worries me too.  who would have thought our new **R** president would not receive **FULL Support** in the House?

unbelievable how far the establishment will go...sacrifice what's right and desperately needed (total reform and reversal of all things Obama) for their own power circle...frightening as hell

at this rate, the people lose regardless if the establishment so deems

heres a guy who gets it. if we don't unite, the GOP will cease to exist. The most important thing is that Hillary does not win. 
When will they be classifieds as a hate/terrorist group?
Somehow this is not a hate crime. If it was a white guy threatening Obama it certainly would be.
Well the only explanation is that Paul Ryan tried and failed to seize the nomination for himself because nether Trump/Cruz would have had the required votes if Trump did not surge at the last minute. So now Ryan is having a very public hissy fit.

&gt; In other words, Facebook’s news section operates like a traditional newsroom, reflecting the biases of its workers and the institutional imperatives of the corporation. Imposing human editorial values onto the lists of topics an algorithm spits out is by no means a bad thing—but it is in stark contrast to the company’s claims that the trending module simply lists “topics that have recently become popular on Facebook.”


Ryan's Congressional district voted over 3:1 Cruz against Donald and another ~15% voted for Kasich in the Wisconsin primary. A lot of people speculate he has future plans for national office. Distancing himself from Donald is likely a matter of self preservation for his seat. 

&gt; The comment, made in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, was the latest sign that many Republican leaders are willing to walk away from their party’s presumptive nominee and distance themselves from the controversy and chaos of his campaign. Many believe Trump will lose badly in a general election, and that he could take senators and representatives down with him. 
 
I think trans people are just flat out weird. To literally decide to get surgery on your genitals is a 10 steps too far imo unless there are complications with development in the womb.

The questions are worded to be anti trump by design. Most of them rephrase the same points in different ways and are about 'bullying'
No, what's disgraceful is the party has lost so much touch with reality that Trump is winning the nod. Thanks Bushes, thanks Romney, thanks everyone fighting to make sure people don't walk into other bathrooms, or every other socially regressive idea out there that keeps walking us backwards and appeals to smaller and smaller bases of people who clearly lack common sense about the world at large.
&gt; but it’s disgraceful when Republicans echo them.

that's for sure

many are the same punks who made a do-or-die deal of forcing Trump to agree to back whomever became the nominee.  hypocrites, establishment pukes
Plans like this are the single greatest thing we could do for struggling inner-city schools. Schools with a majority of students living in section 8 housing revolve around a culture of poverty that needs to be broken up. Previous attempts at this have neglected the need to separate large groups of recipients. Often times its 400 units in a complex that receive section 8. Couple that with the fact that a single school might draw from three complexes. When it's one, two or three units in far more complexes, that culture doesn't permeate in schools and destroy any chance of success. 

This article has far too many adjectives. 
That's ridiculous. This has been tried many times before and it always fails. The theory is that crime and violence won't follow, but it always does.

If you want to help fix poverty and violence you have to change the culture. Moving the culture isn't going to change anything. The way you change the culture is through honest analysis, criticism, focus on self reliance, encouraging two parent households, fixing education(through voucher programs), and availability of jobs.
Truer words have never been spoken. 
The polls have almost entirely been skewed away from Trump. He's been regularly outperforming the estimates. 
Just posted another poll.   Any time the poll likely voters Trump is even or ahead.  Any time they poll registered voters it is Hillary, but within MOE.   When they poll "whoever answered the phone" is when you get the big Hillary leads.    The more likely you are to vote, the more likely you are to support Trump.
Yep. I think it's going to be a surprise with how many states Trump wins and which ones.

[deleted]
yea, but Hillbag is supposed to be ahead in Florida by 6-8-10 or more.  she's dropped from Day-1 of Trump's assumed candidacy and Trump is just getting started

e.g. everything is different with Trump. his Dem crossover vote/polls is **HUGE** as is the black vote for Trump at about 25% now.  typical **R** black vote is closer to 10%.  had Romney won 25% black vote, that ALONE would have given Romney 4 more states won, plenty to be elected president

relax.  the media, the Dem establishment, the Rep establishment...all that crap combined is losing because THE PEOPLE want a champion, need a champion = Trump in a landslide
Not surprising considering the military is mostly conservative.
He's got my vote.
Lots of minorities in the military. 
Your strategy and mine are not mutually exclusive, and would couple to make a great strategy of closing the achievement gap. If fact, the tactics that you listed would be much more effective if your pupils weren't gathered in massive groups of like-minded people. My students disrupt class with the same kids with whom they spend the evenings imitating gang culture until the wee hours of the morning. When I make phone calls to parents about student behavior, they turn and criticize me to their neighbors who also got a phone call from me that day. It's a culture of poverty that students cannot escape. They have no reason to act differently because it is the world that they live in.

Put aside your skepticism for a moment and consider this as something you are tasked with carrying out. If you were to accommodate 400 impoverished families with section-8 housing, would you place them together or would you try to integrate them into broader society. If your goal is to rectify the culture and instill self-reliance, I would argue that you would separate them so that they were surrounded by families that share those qualities. I would argue that your stated goals would be more easily achieved if their children went to good schools and lived in good neighborhoods. 

I'm making the argument because of my experience as a teacher in a school with the chronic illness of a culture of poverty. [Forced integration](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/opinion/sunday/integration-worked-why-have-we-rejected-it.html) was the [largest success](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) in closing the achievement gap. Chicago is currently [decentralizing its subsidized housing with success.](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/chicago-regional-housing-section-eight/398798/) 

So why not do both?

So how does the fact that hillary has a lot of money somehow translate to Trump needing money?

&gt; The social views of the modern mainstream Democrats are, without a doubt, extreme and not reasonable.

Yeah, wanting people to not be harmed because they are different than most people is so extreme an unreasonable. Suppose we should just go back to lynching the darkies for even looking at white women right?

&gt;There's thousands of years of tradition that is being broken in the blink of an eye.

You mean like, how life happens and times change? Are you worshiping Thor lately? Lived in a cave recently? I hear them terrorist love that life. Talked to a Shaman about what hurts? Did that crap for thousands of years too, but most of us moved on for the better of society.

&gt;We know that the best way to raise a family is in a stable marriage with biological parents.

And guess what, the world doesn't work like that - that's a best case scenario which is less than the norm for most people. What are you supposed to do with everyone that falls through the cracks, ignore it? You'd prefer kids be wards of the state over a 2 parent household with a stable income and a caring environment?

&gt;Those relationships are better for society than gay relationships are.

Really hard to swallow that being an orphan is better than being pampered by two people who want to love and care for you. Have you seen how they treat their dogs? Lay some of that pampering on me.

&gt;Personally I am in favor of civil unions nationwide for all people, and "marriage" being left to the churches with less legal meaningfulness than it has today

And personally I'm for the destruction of all religion because of the terrible crimes most of them have been responsible for /involved with, point?

&gt; See the birth control mandate from the ACA for an example of the government trampling on the first amendment rights of churches

And nothing good has come from Churches not paying taxes and teaching people to hate. Or was 9-11 a good thing in your world view? F anyone trying to get special treatment because they believe their sky fairy is better than another persons. The Churches deserve ZERO special privilege. That Catholic church not being burned to the ground over all the massive child sex abuse for decades, reaching all the way to the top of the organization, is a global shame.

&gt;With all the trade deals our government has signed we're already at a competitive disadvantage with so many of our free trade partners

Agreed.

&gt;Raising the federal minimum wage will force every state to be that much less competitive. 

Disagree. 

&gt;There's no chance in hell that the next big Boeing plant or the next big auto plant will be in Tennessee or South Carolina.

Cry me a f-ing river. 

&gt;They'll have no choice but to set up shop in some place like Mexico! 

So they'll be the next Ford and GM. Bending to the will of corporate desires is a sure fire way that the average person will have a harder and harder time to survive. Don't act like all business is just going to magically stop because people start getting paid more. Screw giving millionaires and billionaires anything in terms of more tax breaks and incentives if it's not going to help the average worker. Move to Mexico. See how well that works out for ya Boeing.
but didn't he say later or after another question that if circumstances change, he'd consider?

Just a few things:

&gt; It will be up to franchisees whether to deploy the labor-saving technology

Calling this "labor-saving technology" is disingenuous and incorrect.  It saves capitalists from labor. It doesn't save labor. This kills labor.  You may blame the $15 an hour minimum wage, but business were headed towards this LONG before and regardless of the minimum wage hike. Automation has been happening for decades, and that technologies are finally making minimum wage jobs automatable and corporations desire to automate them has nothing to do with what the minimum wage was, is, or will be. Corps will cut any expenditure and trim the margins to show and make a profit everywhere, and labor costs are one of them. 

Also, this is NOT socialism in action. This is technocratic capitalism/corporatism in action.  This is a capitalist corporation automating a process and doing away with labor completely, therefore doing away with an expenditure and increasing the profit margin for the shareholders.  Again, automation of minimum wage jobs was coming regardless of what the minimum wage was, and is coming no matter what the minimum wage is, and will come no matter what the minimum wage will be. It might make some corporations roll out the technology a little sooner, but beyond that, the minimum wage has nothing to do with it as it was coming regardless of minimum wage levels. 

The increase of the minimum wage has socialist elements to it (please note that the raise in minimum wage has capitalist elements to it as well, so it's not a wholly socialist decision), that I will give you. But the introduction of automation into fast food restaurants is NOT socialism in action, and if you think it is then you clearly do not understand what socialism is. 


Please note - this isn't meant to be an anti-republican rant.  I couldn't care less if you're republican or not. I'm as much anti democrat as anti-republican.  But I am genuinely marxist, and I'm loathe to when the term "socialism" or "marxist" is misused and thrown into something as a boogyman.

&gt; It saves capitalists from labor. It doesn't save labor. This kills labor.

Customers buy and pay for things.  We the people are the customers.  Reducing the cost goods benefits society.

Labor can't be killed.  It is freed. The less work that needs to be done in society to meet our needs and wants the better off society is.

&gt; Again, automation of minimum wage jobs was coming regardless of what the minimum wage was

Not at all true.  Where I live in China its cheaper to hire people and people work hard here so having people smiling at the cash register is a good thing. 

&gt;  But the introduction of automation into fast food restaurants is NOT socialism in action

?? Sure it is.  You are trying to 'fix' the class distinctions caused by wealth disparity via the minimum wage and regulations that have raised the cost of labor to the point where these machines make sense to use. 

You are so stuck in your socialist circle jerk you can't realize we are living in the real world and we want cheaper goods and to have to do less work.  This does not 'enslave' us to the 'capitalists'.

Instead of raising the minimum wage (employees using government force to steal more from employers), why not just have the government steal less (taxes)?

The money is literally printed out of thin air anyway?

Now that we have evolved away from the gold standard, what purpose does taxation serve other than oppression?

Taxes are the appendix of society.  Remove at will.

Both have been considered heavily for decades and probably enable each other anyway.

Since when does anyone turn to Cracked for factual, reliable, information? 
You do know that 90% of all humans used to farm the land or raise animals not that long ago right? 200 years ago yet what happened? Did we as a race die off or become even wealthier during the agricultural revolution?

Just so you know only 2-4% of people in the first world farm and a large number of those are people in tiny family farms not gigantic corporate concerns. We actually throw away and let around 30% of all grown food go bad. Yet we still have so much that people no longer starve in America unless your parents are insane or drug addicts. Most of the poor get so fat so early they actually get diabetes.

Society will survive the coming AI lead revolution and we will be much better off for it.

The long term trend toward automation of low wage jobs has always been market/price driven. There is a price people put on human interaction, most people are willing to pay a little more (couple bucks per visit) for a smiling faced kid to ring up their groceries. If that couple bucks becomes $10 bucks per visit suddenly I don't give a crap and want the self checkout line.

Yes, it was liberals who foisted the debate on this non-issue into the media by suddenly pretending that there is a nationwide crisis over transgendered people using bathrooms. Keep telling yourselves that. It's the liberals who are insanely interested in the genitals of transgendered people .


This is being made out to be a Wedge Issue. Or in other words, an issue designed to divide voting blocks. That is why the left is drumming this up out of proportions. 
  
North Carolina made a choice in its laws, whatever my opinion, thats the state's right. Obama answers by issuing essentially a NATION WIDE threat to public school to follow the White House definition of policy or face possible cuts. The response is ridiculously over loaded.
  
It will back fire, the narrative with be a failed wedge issue and turn into a narrative favorable to smaller government advocates that sees Obama as once again over reaching.
  
One may ask, why would they risk this?
   
Its because they are THAT AFRAID of Trump winning in a landslide which will likely give every GOP running for office a boost. Some of the voting block for Trump are social liberals that are coming over to the republican side for the first time to side with us on fiscal issues and jobs.

I think just put stalls in all the bathrooms and take away the men's/women's thing. Make them all just restrooms. Problem solved. 
[deleted]
Locker rooms are an entirely different story that I don't particularly have a good answer for. Other than private stalls for shower and changing. Private stalls for restroom stuff isn't too big of a challenge though. The only part where there will be intermingling will be the sinks and mirrors. It's not like everybody walks around with their junk hanging out if they are going to pee.

Showers and changing clothes in a locker room will take more thought and probably more construction.

This shouldn't be something that comes from the White House though. Jesus.

This is an incredibly poor town in Mississippi. There's no reason to assume the white people in this town are any better off or smarter than the black people in this town. 
Have you ever gone to a predominately poor black school as a white person? It is not fun and usually the teachers/students are terrible. I had the unfortunate displeasure to go to a 75% black school and it was awful. After a year we used my grandparents address and went to a better school where the teachers actually cared and the students weren't awful and it was great.
Cleveland is not incredibly poor nor are the people there too dumb to know what's best for their kids.

I don't think that's the case. Trump actually stands more to the left on this issue than most (by my observation) republican voters.

For what it's worth, I think both sides are arguing the matter on their own convictions. Most right-leaning folks see it as absurd and are afraid of permissive rules allowing more abuse. Most left-leaning folks see it as a civil rights issue where a group of people have mostly had to face some sort of hate and/or discrimination and want want to protect them.

I think it's being used on both sides as a wedge issue, but with real convictions to back up that division. In many ways, it strikes me as a continuation of the gay marriage debate as pro/con for that issue tend to align with this one too.
I agree that it's being used on both sides. Keep in mind the NC law was still put into place while GOP nomination was still going. Trump handled it well in my opinion by taking the stance of who cares which bathroom but ultimately saying its up to the state.

Ted died on it on one side of the issue, Obama will choose to die on the other side of it. Seems like the smarter people saw it for the nonissue it is and rightfully have ignored it.

Meh.
I feel you missed my point. But I also didn't make it well... None of this was much of an issue until it was forced to be one. Trans people have been using other bathrooms for decades with little to no issue. That is the non-issue. Or at least was. 

I guess I am wrong to say it still is that way. I guess it has become an issue because people with bad intentions found out they can take advantage of it, and if anyone cries foul they can claim persecution. Those types of people manipulating 'social justice' should be the target. But instead we have new over-reaching previously pointless laws pushing both sides of the issue. More laws are rarely the answer.
None of his other political positions matter. Without stopping immigration, none of your Constitutional conservative principles are going to matter.
Very succinct and well put answer.  I may borrow it actually :)
[deleted]
I agree with that. It's an issue created by the left. The right also reacted to it badly and in a way that plays right into the lefts narratives.
Thank you. Tbh this isn't really a subject that I'm really all that passionate about since it effects me very little if at all. It just seems like common sense, I think there is a bigger picture that people are over looking. Mainly the question, why is something that wasn't an issue for so long suddenly really important. People have been using whatever restroom they are comfortable with for a long long time... what changed?
1. Public bathrooms: If you have transitioned enough to be convincing that you are a man or woman, then you've probably been using the bathroom of your choice all along, or using the private family bathroom when available.

2. Assaults: Physical and sexual assault by a trans person is no more likely now than before. What is more likely is an assault on a trans person, or like that lady at Wal-Mart who actually was a woman who got assaulted because another lady thought she was trans. If someone is going to sexually assault a person, they probably aren't going to be a trans person.

3. School bathrooms/locker rooms: This is where I have an issue with this. You now putting minors into a situation they can't really do anything about. If a male student is dressing as a girl and uses the girls' locker room, it's going to be uncomfortable for a lot of girls who don't want someone changing clothes with them who has a penis. If a female student living as a boy changes in the boys' locker room, you have the same issue, but you also likely increase the risk of harassment or some kind of sexual assault on the student. In both cases, you also risk having students taking secret pictures of the student undressed and passing them around.

4. Gym locker rooms: I'm a guy. I change in the mens' locker room at my gym. Are there likely gay men in there also changing, yes. Do I want a female transitioning to a male (at any stage) changing next to me, no. When you are undressed, I don't care if you think you're a male or female in your head, you have external parts that identify you physically as one or the other. If you have all male parts, then change in the male locker room. If you have all female parts, then change in the female locker room. If you have both, perhaps consider using the family locker room that has private dressing areas. Otherwise we should just get rid of gender-specific locker rooms and just let everyone change in a big open room in the middle of the gym.

I'm pretty sure #4 will cause some backlash, but that's fine. Everyone has an opinion on this. I'm no saying anyone shouldn't be allowed to use a locker room at the gym. But I am saying that everyone should consider how something makes everyone else feel. Just because you dress like a woman doesn't mean you are a woman and can change in the women's locker room. If you have a penis, you don't belong in there. If you are a woman dressing as a man, but still have breasts and a vagina, you shouldn't be changing in the men's locker room. If you have breasts and a penis, it's going to make a lot of people uncomfortable, but there are ways to handle that that work for everyone.
I wonder if #3 (the only situation that causes me any real concern) could be alleviated by the trans person in question requiring documentation from a doctor or mental health specialist. 
&gt; The left made it into an issue

How so? It wasn't The Left passing laws about people using the bathroom.
Do all the Republicans here favor requiring Americans to carry a certified copy of their birth certificates in order to use a public bathroom?
I think that's already required, but I don't see how it changes the situation for other students.
If documentation is required, it'll probably greatly reduce the risk of students using the bathroom for ulterior motives.
[deleted]
Right. But I wasn't concerned about the trans student causing the problem. It's other students. All personal opinions aside about the mental health aspect of trans-gender issues, students are generally assholes to people who aren't the same. I was one of those asshole students, so in just speaking from experience. 
Doubt it, Donald for too well informed to make an error such as choosing chris chistie for VP.

Ah, gotcha. Kids are shitty, no force of government or God can change that lol.
Don't mind me... I'm just here to down-vote this Salon article
Why do you say that? I understand the need for improving immigration policy and implementation.

However, at least currently, immigration does not pose as urgent of an existential threat to the country as does foreign policy or economic policy. Immigration needs reform, but it isn't the only issue that matters.
Without stopping immigration, the immigrants are going to vote for what they want to vote for, and that will be that. Economics aren't going to mean anything at that point. We can reverse economic policies, but we can't reverse the effects of immigration at a certain point.
Don't mind me, I am also here to downvote this Salon article. And to question WHY IS THIS IN /r/REPUBLICANS? 

Okay, I'm done.
I'm pretty sure 'anyone not a muslim' from those areas can tell you a whole lot of stories. Plus virulent anti-theism (which explicitly atheist groups almost universally cash out to) has a horrible track record itself from a right-wing perspective.
&gt;Shouldn't this influence the way you vote as to welfare, health care, the prison system and immigrants?

People always quote this shit as if this part is in there:

43.5 And also when HR 3200 was up for vote you criticized the bill and voted nay.
I also seem to recall thou shalt not steal, and 2 Cor 9:7. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart,not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.

The acts you mentioned are to be done by individuals for other individuals not by government.  If we were more like you say we should be there would be less need for people to call for government compulsive altruism.  Also, Jesus tells us that the poor will always be with us.  Government is not the answer - I'd recommend reading the passages about warnings God gives the prophet about Israel yearning for a king.
Assuming that this is a general command (the previous section reveals that "the least of these" is a shortened form of "the least of these brothers of Mine," that is, those who follow Him,) the question seems to assume that voting can fulfill this command.

That's not a position that can really be supported. There is no moral value in giving someone else's money away and most on the right would argue that it's not actually helping those it's intended for anyway, not in the long-term.
reducing the scope of federal government will not the collapse the social obligations made between each state and its citizens. we are a country of law, not a country of obligations.
Aside from what is already said, we are supposed to be helping people that need it. Welfare doesn't help people, it just keeps the same people poor.
Yeah, you're not very likely to have a shot at foreign policy or economy policy changes once the Dems secure a permanent voting majority.  Hint:  People coming from South of the border.  

They know what they are doing.  It seems libertarians don't, or don't care, or actually think it is a good thing to be swarmed by people that overwhelmingly support welfare state expansion.
Just what I expected - a bunch of heartless bastards justifying why they don`t support Jesus! And you dog fucking bastards think you are going to heaven! lol
Jesus told you to give all your money away. Read your fucking bible. And not just the bits where God kills people. Read the bits that are actually supposed to be the words of Jesus, you know, guy at the very center of your religion?
Where did I mention the federal government? The question was about how you vote in general, that includes State and Municipal.
Yeah, that is what Jesus would say too.
Doesn't the bible say Pay unto Caesar what is Caesar's directly referring to taxation? Have you ever read the new testament? You know, the one about Jesus? Your Mexican gardener?
your quotes were intended for individuals (I believe) not states

if it were also for states, we could go socialist and weaken ourselves into becoming a Venezuela then have nothing left to "give".  that would bring bad things to all.  that is certainly not God's intention nor instruction
I have no problem giving to Caesar what is his according to the purpose of his office which is a keeper of the peace and a defender of the people from without and within.  It is not his task to feed sheep.  That is left to the church and it's Shepard's.  This is precisely the problem where institutions are stepping into the roles of others and this is to the detriment of all.
Wow, God is a Republican, I had no idea. And so is Jesus? His dropout hippie son?
But you have a chance to vote for the kind of government you want, that was the question. Would you vote for a government - municipal, state, federal - that had on its platform feeding the hungry, housing the homeless, tax payer funded health care for everyone, humane prisons? 
I certainly would not.  There is a reason why the crowns of king and high priest were not consolidated and placed upon one brow.  Until we enter the kingdom of the Lamb may it not come to pass.
Are you advocating that we let no one in at all?

And since only citizens can vote, are you suggesting that we stop naturalization or immigration entirely?
I wouldn't have used the word "biblically". It's a moral matter, independent of the Bible and religion. That being said, it's great that we have a state taking a stand against congressional overreach and immoral actions such as allowing men into women's bathrooms and vice versa. Obama should have been impeached a while ago, and we're letting him get away with whatever he wants.

Also, I wonder why Mary Fallin vetoed a bill that would have criminalized abortion. That's a fantastic move, all states should be passing bills such as that.
&gt;Jesus told you to give all your money away.

Nope. That was a specific command to a specific person. Jesus interacted with a lot of other rich people and there was never a similar statement made. To read it as a general command is simply not a viable position.

&gt;Read the bits that are actually supposed to be the words of Jesus, you know, guy at the very center of your religion?

Such as how He consistently refers to God as a rich man in His parables? Uses investing and creating wealth as an illustration of good works? Says that the widow who gave a penny did more than those who gave purses, since she was giving a greater share of what she had?

Notably, He never once suggested that they give all their money to Rome so that Rome could take care of the poor. In fact, He took a fairly skeptical approach to taxes in general, claiming that He was exempt from the temple tax and only just barely approving of paying Roman taxes with Roman coins (if you had them.) 
Or, you know, a bunch of people who have actually read the Bible, rather than a few cherry-picked sections that, read utterly devoid of context and with a bunch of presuppositions thrown in, seem to support big government.
The actual quotes from Jesus are few and far between. Surely they are what should matter most to a Christian? Not all that angry vengeful God stuff from the old testament.
Wow, just wow. You bend over backwards to try to show that Jesus, the Son of God is a capitalist and a Republican rather than someone who gave up material things urged his followers to be kind and do good deeds. You are a sick person.

&gt;Says that the widow who gave a penny did more than those who gave purses, since she was giving a greater share of what she had?

Don`t know why you threw that in there, this story supports my view of Jesus, not yours.
I'm not bending over backwards at all. I've simply studied the passages in question. 

Of course, your summary of my position is an absolute strawman, since I never said Jesus opposed giving or being kind. I said Jesus didn't tell everyone to give all their money away and didn't support government enforced giving.

&gt;Don`t know why you threw that in there, this story supports my view of Jesus, not yours.

No it doesn't. The reason the widow's giving was worth more is because it was her choice, out of her money. Giving through government spending takes both the choice and the money from someone else.
Well you missed the whole point of that story. the rich gave what they could afford. The widow gave what she had. That is what made the widows gift greater than the gifts of the wealthy.

That you understand this story the way that you do clearly supports what I said about you.
Obama is using it to distract both left and right from some of the dramatic failiures of his administration.  20% of families with nobody employed, other countries walking all over us on trade, environmental policies that don't protect the environment and instead pick winners and losers, utterly disastrous foreign policy from Ukraine to the Middle East to the South China Sea.  Murder rates rising, police afraid to do their jobs, and whole swathes of the community that don't trust law enforcement.

If we talk about bathrooms, we don't talk about this.

Does it really matter where you piss when the whole house is burning?
Well that's a complex answer.  In America, because of our two party system, the parties have to cast a wide net and be very broad in their platform. The Republican Party encompasses libertarians who want government to do the least amount possible and neoconservatives who want the government to do a whole lot of things. I would recommend that you do two things. 

First, read the Republican Party platform. 

https://www.gop.com/platform/ 

That's the official statement of what their beliefs are. 

Next read the position portion of Donald Trump's website. 

https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions

He's the presumptive Republican nominee for president which means that, for now at least, he's the de facto leader of the Republican Party.  A plurality of Republican voters voted for him and thus presumably agree with at least a portion of his positions. If he wins, he'll likely have a very strong hand in shaping the Republican platform going forward.


That should give you a fairly decent idea of what American Republicanism is about. 
I'll definitely use this, thanks 
Define value politics and the GOP is immensely against wealth redistribution. 
Don't use the Trump stuff - his policies are far different than nearly every other Republican, and he's not really gaining support for his positions so much as for himself (his campaign is basically about being able to "make deals" and do a better job than other people can).

Instead, look up Paul Ryan's policies. He's the intellectual leader of the party right now, and the highest-ranking Republican elected official (being in charge of the lower house of our legislature, which arguably has more power than the upper house, especially on budgetary/redistributive issues). He's a policy wonk in this area and he's the real person you should be looking into.
To be fair, the assignment I am doing is about why Trump is so succesfull.
[deleted]
Paul Ryan is an important figure, there's no doubt about that, but at this juncture I'd say that his branch of the Republican Party, the neoconservatives, is on the way out. Their candidates got completely trashed in the primaries,unless you count Cruz and I honestly wouldn't. They're going to be relegated to the same status as the libertarian wing going forward I think. 

Regardless, the official party platform as it stands now ought to largely overlap with him. If the report is on the rise of Trump, comparing and contrasting those two would be more useful. 
He rarely does prepared speeches.  His whole thing is just sort of talking like a guy at a family dinner.  That said, his foreign policy speech at aipac was a very good speech.  It outlines his plan for foreign policy.  His debate performance and his toying with the media have been the hallmark of his campaign.  I would focus on that if I were you. 
Paul Ryan isn't really a neoconservative. He's a conservative, sure, but he's not a foreign policy hawk and he was never part of the W administration or their ilk.
I'm a Republican and love almost all of Trump's ideas and policies. Don't be a butthurt Cruzbot.
And yet, he hates Trump and is willing to hand the election to Hillary rather than endorse him.
The 'we will not surrender to the false song if globalism' 
It was his foreign policy speech, and I'd also say it was his best prepared.
I'm really fond of his initial speech when he announced his candidacy.
I would play that nice song those girls sang and you will instantly win over their hearts and minds!
His speech at the AIPAC conference is my personal favorite. Made some strong policy positions and cemented his ability to be presidential to me. 
It does. I believe that when you see someone hungry you should give them something to eat. When you see someone who needs a place to stay to take them in. When you see someone sick to help them. To visit those who are in jail.

I don't support taking someone else's money and giving it to the Government. Jesus was not telling believers to give money to the Government so that the Government could distribute it. Jesus was speaking to the believers themselves. In no way should Christians abdicate their responsibility to help those less fortunate by giving their money to the Government and then asking the Government to help others instead.
they're all very similar, but the pivot off events immediately prior to a speech is what gooses me up.  I believe it was a AZ or NM speech that had me yelling ""**YEA YEA, that's right Donald!  those punks, those pukes.  Yea, you get 'em !!!**
The Democratic party has always been against Sanders, his supporters do not follow the DNC line. To say the Democratic party is turning on it's darling is misleading it is obvious that the DNC want Clinton and will do anything for Clinton to be the Candidate. 
Plenty of people hate Trump, but that doesn't make all of them neoconservatives.
How not? Trump is the perfect picture of a moderate conservative. If you're a conservative but hate a candidate that is actually willing to take action against illegal immigration, overspending, terrorism, unemployment, and constitutional oveerreach; I'd say you're a neoconservative.

Why isn't the temple of Mohammed and those dumb Mosques a hole in the floor like say the stupid temples of Zeus or some other dead god? Saudis are such fucking losers without outisde life support, I don't think it would have been such a bad thing if the US turned Mecca into a crater after 911, watch all those dumb fucks fight over the new hole in the ground and  kill / cripple / beat whomever comes out on top...job fucking done. and btw this is not a pro-war post I'm against war and interventionism, but they should have punished the Saudi after 911 not Iraq.
Calm down there, Trump. I think we've seen that bombing the hell out of a country doesn't work out very well. 
[deleted]
It worked once. When we were the only people with nuclear weapons. And I wouldn't call vaporizing millions of people "working".
[deleted]
It wasn't "millions of people." Higher estimates put it at 250,000 - including from the initial blasts and the radiation effects months down the road. Do you think that Imperial Japan would have given up so easily had we not dropped the nukes? No, they would have fought til the last man then made their kids fight much like Germany did. We would have lost men fighting back too. End result? Just as many people would have die (if not more) and the war would have been prolonged by another year or two. It was a necessary evil. Deal with it.  
Again, I'd like to point out, no one else had nuclear weapons. Now that multiple countries have them, they are controlled under the guarantee of mutual destruction if anyone uses a nuke.
bombing the hell out of the wrong country - ie Iraq - doesn't work out very well
ya gotta be nice to Bernie (we **R** do).  Bernie can make a super mess of the Dem convention, which I am looking forward to.  it's coronation or chaos.  I like the prospect of pandemonium
It doesn't really matter whether or not they had them. If Hitler or Tojo built them before we did, you could be sure as shit that they would have used it on us. We just beat them to the punch. I'm all for peace and diplomacy but get real, dropping two bombs saved a lot of lives by ending the war early. 
Once. It worked once. Dropping a nuke now would have unimaginable consequences and would not end anything.
what would anybody's reasoned excuse be for hiring a criminal as president?
He believes that the United States federal government is the solution to problems, both home and abroad, rather than a major contributor to the problem.

Jesus Christ. How can anybody have any sympathy for them?
I have a feeling in Libya and Syria and other places some of them are kidnapping kids, and using the stolen child as a battering ram to get into the West, Europe and USA. If you DNA test the kid you might see maybe it is not theirs, no person with any humanity would do this to their own child.
That would make them only slightly less monstrous. I don't think they are doing that, at least not to the level where this article shows.

They teach their small children to kill and fight, that it's a heroic way to die by blowing themselves up if they take infidels with them.

I know for a fact that their own children are suicide bombing. That they plan on our hesitance to fire on children, even if they are shooting at us. Their own children or not, using a child the way that they do is despicable, and evil.

That's how ridiculously right our country has become. So far that it is now extreme right instead of good conservativism. Because of this the right can't see the different between real conservatives, it all looks like radical leftists because real conservativism is more left than the republican party has been forced by a centrist democratic party. 
Thanks /u/FragRaptor for the explanation!
Wtf? How is someone who's for top down big government run by the feds more conservative than someone who consistently advocates that we let states decode things like Trump? 
ty for posting the thread. Its the crazy people that keep everyone sane. Democracy is a system based on war, difference is they change it from real war to war of ideas, the republic system allows the democracy to happen on a mass scale reasonably. We should be proud of our far right and far left people because in the end what comes out is a very stable center. 
If you think electing a socialist in this far right political climate will turn it into a far left socialist dystopia, you do not understand politics.
I generally don't have a problem with Obama but his ridiculously authoritarian stance on gun rights is my biggest pet piece, as well as his promotion of globalist free trade policies such as TPP. 
I understand the angle, but Webb's near complete lack of vote pull seems to speak against him. What did he get during his own time in the race? 1%?
Doubt it. But I honestly can't tell or guess who he's probably considering. Hell he might not even know yet. 
Because Trump consistently switches his viewpoint from a to b to c to a to d to e to b to f to g to c to h to i to d to j to k to e.... etc. We don't know where the hell he stands on any issue. He's been on both sides of every issue in this debate, sometimes on both sides at once.
Lol and that makes him more liberal than Sanders how? 
&gt; If he wants conservative votes, he must at least pretend to be conservative.

Trump is more conservative than the current Republicans in office. 
I suppose there's no doubt that Trump is a better alternative to Clinton, but I'll use the analogy Ben Shapiro uses - 

Hillary's driving us towards a cliff at 100 mph and Trump would drive us towards that cliff at 50 mph. While 50mph may be preferable, a RINO like Trump getting elected means the break and reverse systems in the car are getting yanked out completely. 

Trump is hardly a conservative - his solutions are all vague big-state policies and he panders to the right in the most superficial of ways. He's going to be redefining the GOP into something even more leftist (in terms of economic policy and the size and scope of the state) than it already was. That's why I'm still tentatively in the nevertrump camp. If the country's going to get run off a cliff, at least let it be at the hands of a Democrat so we can have some hope of getting a true classical liberal, free-market, constitutionalist conservative the next time around.

Perfect response. This guy is a tool and deserved to be cursed at. There's a million reasons to pick fights with the alt-right and trumpkins, none of them have anything to do with anyone's sexual history and interests.
What event was this at, and do you have a link to the full video of it?
To be fair, he also says that feminism is a way for unattractive women to obtain power, attention, and status in society.

Can't the same be argued for the alt-right and "virgins" lacking natural social skills, who are seeking to revert the leftist operating paradigm and sexually empower themselves?
Reminds me when some had signs that said things like 'Let us in or die!'
How intolerant of this leftist, he just assigned sexual orientation to a large group of people regardless of their own preferences! something something asexuals and nonbinary sjw crap...
Science and medicine say it does, and tests show it does, so I'm glad he's realized it *does.*
of course they are.  Trump plays nice with everyone neutral to pro Trump.  but Rubio is going nowhere, e.g. zero chance for VP
Defending yourself is different.
&gt; Trump is hardly a conservative -

Walk me through this. 

&gt; He's going to be redefining the GOP into something even more leftist (in terms of economic policy and the size and scope of the state) than it already was.

How so? 

&gt; at least let it be at the hands of a Democrat so we can have some hope of getting a true classical liberal, free-market, constitutionalist conservative the next time around.

What do you think these words mean?
Rubio's political career is over if he doesn't play nice with Trump. No surprise he has chosen to do so. And Trump is at the stage where he should be playing nice with anyone that doesn't oppose him.
The city I lived in was called Camargo Taumalipas just in case you were wondering.

not much of a goal

better would be to educate about the nation's founding principles.  being/joining party is nowhere there to be read/seen.  I rejoice about your excitement and desire to help, but you have to study more, e.g. everything about the Constitution, state's rights, individual freedoms...
I do feel bad for Marco.  This just wasn't his race.  It's kinda cringeworthy that Trump gave him such a beating that his own Senate seat might be at risk so Trump has to essentially endorse him to help out.  

Marco is young.  With time, he may be something great.  I don't want to see him end it here.
My family comes from Taumalipas too!
All of that is part of being a Republican.  Power will always corrupt, but the Republican party is the people and as long as the people stick to the basic conservative principles the party will do alright in the end.

Trump '16 and '20.
Promised transparency in government and has prosecuted more whistleblowers than any all other presidents combined.

Trump has hijacked our party with a xenophobic fervor that has been endorsed by the leader of the KKK. That's not a conservative. That's an asshole.
Oh please.  Do your own research dude.  The KKK grand dragon has endorsed Clinton.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/12192975/The-KKK-leader-who-says-he-backs-Hillary-Clinton.html

You're not scared of muslim invaders?  Go to Europe for a few weeks and tell me their a great source of prosperity over there.
The KKK also donated to Hillary's campaign. Their endorsement means nothing, it's not like Trump accepted it. Also, since when is protecting the country against terrorism xenophobic? Sounds like you've been drinking the media's Kool-Aid.
How about kicking every black student out before a rally begins, violating their first amendment right to protest.
That has nothing to do with race, there are lots of black people at his rallies. He kicks out protestors to have a peaceful rally. Weak attempt at race baiting, man.
You want to know why I can't stand him: http://www.alternet.org/donald-trumps-war-first-amendment
Well the media has done nothing but slander him, telling obvious lies to make him look bad. It worked on you people. I don't blame him one bit for being pissed off about that.
Yeah, but he wants to sue people who say he isn't worth as much as he claims, when he justifies those claims by valuing the word "Trump" at billions of dollars on its own. He's done doublespeak throughout the campaign, being on both sides of every issue, something we constantly deride Hillary for but let him get away with. We can't let a man who contradicts himself within the span of 2 sentences get elected. We don't know what he stands for, because he constantly changes positions.
He values the Trump brand, which is the combined value of his many companies. That's how wealth works.

Please, give me one example where he contradicts himself. It hasn't happened, that's media dishonesty and nothing else.
[deleted]
How about him being ultra-pro-life until he got the nomination, then immediately u-turning and saying he doesn't really give a damn either way. 
I follow him anywhere I can and have not seen him say he doesn't care.
He basically said he would change it to pro-life, than said he'd rather let the states decide. But even larger than this is my issue with what he said about terrorists. Now I know none of us love terrorists. They are terrorists. But when he said we have to go after and kill the families of terrorists, that's too far. Does it appeal to our base desires? Yeah, of course it does. But it's in direct violation of the Geneva Convention, which is more or less universally recognized as the standard by which the world has agreed to play by. Those who do not follow it we have decried the actions of for more than half a century, due to them committing WAR CRIMES. We can't accept a president who's talking about committing war crimes. We can't accept a president who's considering the use of nuclear arms again. Tell me what you like about the man, I am legitimately curious. And if you're just going to tell me "he says it like it is", or "he's not part of the establishment", or "he insulted chris christie", well, in the case of the third I agree with you, that's pretty cool, but none of these are reasons on their own to vote for someone. Think about this, if someone said "Don't believe what Fox says about Obama", would you listen? I'm legitimately curious how you come to the conclusion that he is the "BEST" presidential candidate the party has had in years.
All of Trump positions are within the party platform. The only think I heard Trump suggesting to change is to include abortion in case of rape and risk for the mother.

Now, his positions do differ from what people outside many times think as "republicans", which are neocons. For them, it's payback time. Their positions almost destroyed the party.
There's a bit of nuance here. On paper, Trump's stance on immigration is perfectly in line with the GOP's as a political party. In reality, a whole lot of Republicans like to simply pay lip service to the idea of halting illegal immigration, etc. Actually making it a prominent issue with the intention of following through is another matter entirely.
The only real differences are including abortion in the case of rape and risk for the mother, and little nuances regarding trade (free trade vs fair trade).
Where do I begin? He has a sensible tax plan. He has a sensible healthcare plan. He wants to get rid of the ACA and the terrible trade agreements we've gotten into over the past several years. He wants to actually take action against terrorism. He wants to actually take action against illegal immigration. He doesn't pander to environmentalists. He believes in state's rights. He's a constitutionalist. He's a nationalist. He wants to stop invading countries and forcing western democracy on them. He wants to shut down Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programs. He wants to amend our relationship with Russia. He wants to penalize companies who move their production out of the country but still sell their product here. He's called out our terrible leaders from both sides of the aisle. And yes, he's not PC.

We haven't had a candidate of his caliber since Reagan, and Reagan was our last great, or even half-decent, President. The similarities between the two are shocking. I dare say Trump has the potential to be even better than Reagan.
Trump actually intends to implement conservative policies, rather than pay lip service to doing so, as most republicans do.
That lip service may be part of the frustration fueling the Trump movement. The wall rhetoric is very popular and most see it as a plan, not lip service.

&gt; Trumpkins

I'm baffled *that's* the label people have settled on. It *sounds* like surrender. 

&gt; Well, I guess we can't come up with anything better...
If the alt-right is an attempt to revert social norms back to how the human race has operated for thousands of years (if not far longer), I'm not sure the argument resonates. It seems that these maligned groups are merely attempting to defend themselves after being a whipping boy for 30 years.
Didn't the tribe she is apart of protest her recognition as a native American? If they couldn't do it, some internet petition is only going to serve to make her opposition look petty and drown out any real grievances.


Good point.  Easy to win the guaranteed R voters, hard to win the I voters.  Trump already has them, Hillary needs them.
hahaha, that's what I intended to convey to readers. Teaching the concept of the Republic will obviously involve an in depth analysis of both history and current Republican systems.
hahaha that's aweomse :)
PC culture is just as much a scourge as racism 
I'm a republican, but why are they considering anyone other than the guy whose fairly close in regular delegates as the "alternative"? Clearly he's popular with a decent portion of voters. 
Are they trying to dissuade people from feeling this way? They're kind of hitting the nail on the head here.
I'm confused, I'm not sure if they're trying to say feeling this way is bad or not.  It would help if we could see the panels in context.  Even evil men can make points that you say hmmm.

That said I'd never join an organization like hydra but if marvel is trying to say that some of those things are wrong to feel that way about, it's basically said the Republican Party is a terror groupon the the level of hydra.  That's not really a good thing for them to be saying.  

Comics have tried to be controversial going on several decades now.  Can't say I'm surprised, just wondering if they'll have a hero say the complete opposite and thus make that view unacceptable or whether they will have a hero try and incorporate elements of these people back into society by saying something along the lines of "these views are valid but you shouldn't resort to violence.  

Again we need the full context of the comic.
Long story short the Red Skull has changed tactics and is playing the long game.

Basically instead of trying to wipe away the old political order he is trying to salami slice his way towards the same end state. He is still the same evil dude though, just settling on getting the world there in stages. He will say more or less a reasonable things with a hint of being too far then once everything is fine he will say a new slightly more out there idea.

In the same issue was a side story of a down on his luck kid who enjoyed going to these talks. Then is brought into the real club, joins HYDRA and is used to suicide bomb an Amtrak train. 

While there is also evidence he has been messing with Captain America's memories and inserting a positive memory of a previous version of Hydra.
So which is this page the reasonable club thing or the less than reasonable?
Oh come on now, the 'bad guy gets reformed, is now a good guy' trope is a popular one in comics!

More seriously, this is typical. I got into comics late with the Civil war arc, but got out of it just a bit after. Stuff like this didn't help.
Red Skull did nothing wrong hail hydra
By default it's the more mainstream one, as this pattern has only really come up since January or so. But at one point we go from Skull helping with a giant super villain prisonbreak to a bar and gathering showing it is all part of his strategy to show he was right and Captain America is wrong and that Hydra has won in his own paraphrased words.

For the kids story it goes from him being at a meeting felling a bit better about his lot in life. Then he gets "tested" and forced to help beat up a homeless dude, then he has to get inked up with a giant octopus logo, then it's time for him to sacrifice.

So it's basically him using as reasonable mostly mainstream rhetoric as a recruiting tool, to then cause more chaos and make his message all the more attractive than it might otherwise.
Is it ham fisted in parts? Yeah, but it also is a new direction that we haven't really seen.

Bad guys and goons are usually nameless, it is interesting and beneficial on a level to examine where they come from, how some get drawn to putting on a suit and fighting the damn Avengers.

Is it money, true believers, just crazy, did they know what they were getting into? 
That is not unlike how suicide bombers are recruited for terrorists.  Not sure if this is art reflecting life intentionally or by accident either way it's an interesting storyline.  Still it would be interesting to see what aspects the "heroes" endorse and thereby the writers say to the readers this is where the line is.
I think it is very intentional if less than nuanced way. Like "the American taliban" line on news room. 

And it is interesting, we have always traditionally lauded hero's for striking out for disenfranchised or down trodden or oppressed  groups and such. 

But are there limits, is there a balance if a hero identifies as a citizen but is also confronted with global issues. How does that interplay.

For a while Sam Wilson, Captain America's black friend as falcon took over and it was at times a charged experience. Lots of asking "do I do it like Steve would, or like I believe it should, is there an expected perspective for captain America". Which o think speak in general to each successive generation questioning the legitimacy of their experience and perspective.
Guess the wall should have been built earlier to prevent YOU from crawling in like a vermin. 
Well, he's not wrong. Did you expect Obama's son to look like Marty McFly?
Yeah... I'd vote for that guy, tbh.
Maybe Republicans needs to just start having pseudo-Hitler characters repeat stuff that liberals say?

Fun Fact: There are more isis in Lybia than Syria now.
Its funny how often people do that.

So, did any of the 'conservative' cucks who had a Zuckerberg meet-up speak out against this yet? My guess is 'total silence or full support'.

I'm sure they will. If they do attack they will be in for a surprise. Many more Americans are ready to defend themselves from an attack than nearly all other countries.

Short answer: everything.
The best one yet.   Fantastic job.
I concur.
"Clinton’s push to hold gun manufacturers liable when their guns are used in crimes would essentially end gun manufacturing in the U.S., as the liability risks would be much too high." Bull shit. The day that arms dealing because non-profitable will be the day the world economy collapses. 
Faggot cucks, even together, cannot become a tough bundle of sticks
We are worried about the terrorist in office 
The people have spoken. They go against Trump they can kiss their sorry asses goodbye. 
Cannot WAIT to see these guys losing their seats en masse.  Who do they think will support them in great enough numbers when they shit on the people with such wet, explosive force?

career ending move or he'll switch to **D** which actually he is
God the republican party has gone to shit.  All started with Newt Gingrich.  


CUCK ALERT
Good, easier when these RINOs come out and declare themselves instead of just relying on deception and shadows.
Ryan is an embarassment. Trump was saying that the judge should recuse himself; not that the judge can't do his job. 
Its actually the judges job to recuse himself if he is biased...

NO ONE was suggesting the judge can't do his job because of his mexican heritage. Eddie Monster didn't even know what is at issue. 
Protect? On whose behalf? The effing Bushes?
This poll is idiotic. They are grouping 4 separate qualities into just the first question.

* Collaborates with others
* makes fair decisions
* takes responsibility for his/her actions
* is open to criticism

These are all in one question you are supposed to rate. Who thought this was a good way to make a survey? You would need to rank these separately since they are completely different things. Trump is not open to criticism and directly attacks the record of anyone who criticizes him but he is an amazing collaborator. He makes the greatest deals and works with a lot of people around the world. He take responsibility for his actions but rarely apologizes for them. You cannot group two polar opposites into one question and then ask for an overall response. This is poorly made.

Trump doesn't allow people to criticize him without looking at their record and intentions first. This is a good thing because you need to look at people's motives to find out if their criticism is valid or just a political move.
The Clintons.
Protect the GOP brand for who? The Dems have been running it since 2006.
Lol. The most I operant question that was never asked was whether or not Trump was correct. Everyone enjoyed on the racist card before even considering the legitimacy of his statement. 
Look, disagree on policy all you want but no one wants a dumpster fire of a government.  We are above all citizens of the same country.  Having an opposition with whom you can have rational dialog is healthy.  The current situation, on both sides, is in no one's best interests.
Ryan is an idiot, though. Trump has a legitimate case against the judge. He was hand-picked as a Hillary supporter and somebody of Mexican heritage so that he would be biased against Trump and convict Trump of bullshit charges.
the subject is saving America.  Hillbag or Trump?  ultra simple
True, the only possible answer is neither. 
Okay, so you are of the opinion that SCOTUS appointees should be liberal?

You types are the worst conservatives we have around.  So blind in your hate that you cannot even see what the future will hold if we have a 5-4 or even 6-3 or worse SCOTUS in favor of anti-second amendment and other crap.

Think about the future for a moment.
First, did I label myself a conservative?  Perhaps I have nuanced positions on complicated issues, or maybe I'm more conservative on some issues than others?  We used to have a political system that was not binary.  It's the binary system has led us to the current mess.  Regardless, who says that a candidate that I would support would appoint liberal justices?

Secondly, why do you assume Trump will appoint conservative justices, if that's your most important issue?  He is not conservative.  He has shown absolutely no indication that he will follow convention or do what party leaders expect of him.  He has no consistency of principles whatsoever.  It's quite a leap of faith to expect him to act any differently when it comes to nominations.


He has a list of possible conservative appointees.

You are basically saying you trust Hillary over Trump on this point.  That is just madness.

It doesn't matter who you support at this moment if it isn't one of the presumptive nominees - nobody else has a chance.

All that matters is SCOTUS imo because that lasts FAR longer than a single president will.

Perhaps when it gets closer to election time, this simple fact will begin to become more apropos to those like yourself.  If not, you will be personally responsible for the eventual assaults on the bill of rights.
brand?  you mean smoke and mirrors claims?  yea, we know all the lines about what **R** stands for (brand)...and we also know they lie
Which he may or may not stick to.  After all, anything he says is, according to him, just a suggestion.  And he has shown absolutely no predilection to be bound by or have any respect for the constitution.

I actually support a candidate who wants to defend the Bill of Rights.  You might want to check him out.  I refute the assertion that no one but the two authoritarian candidates has a chance, as that is true only if we make the choice to vote for them.  In spite of just beginning to build name recognition, he's actually polling in double digits already and leading HRC among independents.  He's quite likely to be in the debates.  If you do the math, by pulling 1/5 of the support of the other candidates he will be running neck and neck.  I know well more than 1/5 support their candidate only because they are afraid of the perceived opponent.  Wouldn't it be refreshing if they didn't vote out of fear and instead embraced an alternative who stands for our rights and liberties?

Ryan has to go.  It's really just time to clean house of these milquetoasts that have spent more energy opposing Trump than they ever did against the Dems/Obama.
Is that really your only defense:  I'm not sure he will do what he says.

If another candidate had a chance in hell I would welcome that discussion, but I prefer to live in reality.

Are you talking about Gary Johnson?  The guy that laughs about smoking pot and driving?  This guy?
He contradicts himself constantly, so it's impossible to have any idea what he will do.  He's demonstrated himself to be nothing but narcissistic and self-serving and to have no respect for other people or the law.  He's fundamentally unfit to be president and represents all that is wrong with America.  But feel free to ignore all that in the name of the possibility of who he might nominate for the supreme court.  It's your choice and you have the right to express your opinion.
And how do you feel about Hillary Clinton?

You cannot talk about your fears of Trump without contrasting them with your beliefs/feelings about the alternative.
She is also unacceptable.  I won't support either one.

And before you come back with the ridiculous argument that a vote for Johnson is a vote for Hillary, just stop.  It's not.  It's a vote for Johnson.  Hillary people would say it's a vote for Trump.  It can't be all three.

I don't owe my vote to Trump or the party.  The party owes the country a qualified and suitable candidate.  The candidate has the opportunity to earn my vote.  He's flat out stated he has no interest in or need for the support of those who take issue with him.  So he gets his wish, he does not have my support.  If Hillary is elected, it is not my fault, it is his fault and the fault of those who chose him.

Alexander Hamilton:  "If we must have an enemy at the head of the Government, let it be one whom we can oppose &amp; for whom we are not responsible, who will not involve our party in the disgrace of his foolish and bad measures. ... The party in the hands of whose chief it shall sink will sink with it and the advantage will all be on the side of his adversaries."
Sorry, but simple math would say that a vote that would normally go to the Republican ticket that doesn't is in fact a vote for Clinton.

A vote that would normally go for one party that switches to the other party is a 2 vote swing.

So you can deny reality all you want, what you are doing is supporting Clinton by your actions.

GO ahead and protest vote, that's your free choice.  But don't lie about it.
That's rich. Considering who you're supporting, you have an interesting definition of a lie. 

You've assumed my vote belonged to Trump in the first place. It didn't. If I wanted to elect Trump, I'd vote for Trump. I want to elect Johnson. So voting for Trump would hardly help to achieve that. If I voted for Trump then, I'd be wasting my vote. 

Since I'm not voting for Clinton, at most it would be a one vote swing over supporting a GOP candidate anyway. If the election comes down to that one vote in my state, I can live with that, not because I support him but because I refuse to vote for either. Neither is better than the other. 

If the Republicans wanted my vote, they should have nominated a candidate suited for the job. 


Why are you posting in /r/republicans then? 
Because I believe in what the Republican party is supposed to stand for, but not its candidate or its leadership.

That does not mean I have an obligation to vote for the Republican candidate.  In fact, I have a moral obligation to stand up to the party when it is wrong and hold its leadership to a higher standard.
So a protest vote in hopes they get the message.  Admirable, but to them you are just a useful tool to keep their grip on power in whatever way they can.

I understand your frustration, I just think there is a lot of fear re: Trump that is blown out of proportion and certainly isn't held in contrast to what Clinton and the establishment are holding onto.

The republican establishment know very well their jobs are on the line when Trump is inaugurated and they fear losing everything that has given them power.  If that wasn't the case, they wouldn't be giving their tacit support for Hillary (who will allow their power to continue as has been the case for however long).  Trump is an unknown and if I still believed the tripe that the establishment has been shoveling into our mugs for my entire life, I would be right there with you.

I'm tired of a government that doesn't enforce the rule of law.
Not exactly a protest vote. I'm not saying I wouldn't cast a protest vote if it came to that, because really under absolutely no circumstances will I vote for either of these two, and I will be counted in dissent. But in this case I don't think it's a protest vote. He actually has a good chance to earn some electoral votes. Whether he can win outright or not, only time will tell (both candidates would have to implode, but that is not impossible), but I believe regardless he will emerge as a viable alternative and not just a footnote. If I'm proven wrong it won't be the only time in my life. But I'd be surprised if I'm casting the deciding vote. We learned in 2000 that individual votes aren't actually counted and that if it's close then the courts will decide anyway. 

If anyone is a useful tool, it is those who will blindly accept what is foisted upon us when we don't agree. If we don't object, we deserve what we get. 

I understand the desire for an anti-establishment candidate. The problem is that Trump is the exact definition of the establishment, without any redeeming leadership qualities that would enable him to serve for the greater good. 
I agree anyone who does so blindly is a useful tool - we need more people that are critical thinkers and willing to talk about things that are often easily clouded by emotion.

Why do you think Trump is establishment?

What leadership qualities do you wish he had?
Why is Trump establishment?  By definition, the establishment are those holding power.  He comes from money and privilege, and has lived his life as if he is not governed by the rules that apply to others who lack the benefit of his position.  He has used his money to quite openly buy influence, and has used that influence to make himself more money and to gain more power.  He runs in the circles of others who are wealthy and powerful.  He absolutely is the establishment.

What are qualities of a leader?  The list is long and in many ways the best example would be to hold up a negative of Donald Trump.  A few:  

A real leader has integrity, is honest in word and his dealings, has unassailable character, and is accountable.  A real leader admits when his is wrong and works to improve.  A real leader respects other people and is inclusive.  A real leader knows what he doesn't know and takes the advice of competent advisors.  A real leader is a positive inspiration to others and makes them want to be better than they knew they could be.  A real leader is capable of understanding opposing viewpoints and is able to cooperate with those who may disagree with him to achieve results.  A real leader makes those around him better in character and ability such that they become more successful.  A real leader is above all a humble servant who puts those for whom he is responsible ahead of himself.
So you think Trump is a real leader.  I agree.
Hillary getting elected will be Hillary-supporters fault. No one else's. This ridiculous "it's your fault if you vote for a third party" argument is irritating. I am only responsible for MY vote, not what anyone else does.
Oh, yeah, that describes him to a T.
That's just denying reality because it makes you feel bad.

I understand the argument, but it's a false narrative because there are only two REALISTIC winners to the contest.  If you are choosing to abstain from that choice, the reality is that the lesser of the two evils in your mind is losing your vote.

It's a choice that you are making to feel good about yourself, nothing else.
No, it's a false narrative that my abstinence from voting for a candidate I don't like makes any other candidate's election my fault. If the RNC really wanted to win this election, Trump would not be the nominee, end of story. I will not take responsibility for other people's choices, just like I don't expect them to take responsibility for mine.

Advancing the "it's your fault!" argument is just to give you someone to blame, when we have a shitty candidate principled people don't want to vote for.
The RNC doesn't choose their candidate, the people do, so your premise isn't even correct.
Who’s Paul Ryan Kidding With His Poverty Program? – The Big Picture 

(via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJEfGsJsXfw)

Jun 10, 2016

Paul Ryan introduced his new “anti-poverty” program today – and while it has a fancy new title (“A Better Way”) – it’s more or less the same austerity plan Republicans like him put forward when they say they’re trying to fight poverty. 

It would cut Social Security – impose onerous new work requirements on a number of different welfare programs – slash funding for Head Start – and even do away with a new law that requires financial advisors to act in their clients best interest. 

Who’s Paul Ryan kidding? 

When are Republicans going to admit that the best anti-poverty plan is a strong labor movement coupled with a protectionist trade policy, high taxes on the rich and a regulated financial industry? 

Charles Sauer, Rodell Mollineau, &amp; Neil McCabe all join Thom Hartmann to discuss this.

Eric Brown [https://www.youtube.com/user/ebrown0071] Commented:

Paul Ryan Makes America Greedy Again. 

Paul Ryan is a puppet for the Koch brothers and Wall Street Corporatists. 

Ryan supports corporate welfare and bailouts for the rich, but wants austerity for the poor! 

He is not a conservative or even a libertarian, but is a corporatist puppet for the rich. 

He endorsed the loser Flip Romney in 2012. 

Paul Ryan is currently being primaried. 

He will go down like Eric Cantor.﻿ 
Fuck that principled argument bullshit. The left forgot about that when they pushed identity politics at the expense of their allies. 
I'm not sure all are 'refugees' some may be union workers, anarchists or 2nd or 3rd generation Moroccans or Arabs
that video won't be used in any Paris police recruiting films
This is riots over the labor law reforms... it has nothing to do with refugees.
&gt; Paul Ryan is currently being primaried

and I certainly support whomever can dump this ass out of D.C.

The people in this video, protesting labor law reform, act a bit different.
&gt;  The party owes the country a qualified and suitable candidate. 

And so they gave us

* Ted Cruz
* John Kasich
* Marco Rubio
* Jeb Bush
* Carly Fiorina
* Rick Santorum
* Rand Paul
* Mike Huckabee
* Chris Christie
* Jim Gilmore
* Ben Carson

All of whom were soundly rejected by the Republican base as being unworthy of representing them. The GOP has problems, and they're not Trump.
Trump is in some ways a symptom. I agree they have some problems and because a plurality of heir primary voters showed poor judgment and their leadership failed to help coalesce around a more reasonable candidate, they will probably lose this election, and possobly more to come. 
&gt;  and because a plurality of their primary voters showed poor judgment 

I want to hit pause for a moment so I can talk about something that's been eating at me, which your words have dragged out: Namely, why is it that when the GOP has opted for neo-liberals, religious conservatives, and warhawks, did so many seem to think that the voters were showing "good judgement"? These factions have been disastrous for the country, outsourcing citizens jobs, losing the American culture war, and involving the US in costly and useless military conflicts all over the Middle East and North Africa. 

The GOP has been in trouble for a very long time, and Trump is the voters throwing a hand-grenade stenciled with "Fuck you!" into Washington.
Funny. One of my friends is in paris with her children right now, and she hasn't mentioned it. I guess maybe crazy right wing conspiracies on facebook aren't the most reliable news source, eh? What's next? Japan at war with giant, radioactive lizard?
there are football hooligans riots for the Soccer games and workers union strikes all over France these past 48 hrs, while the town of Calais in French press is described as an Islamist 'jungle' ...maybe your friend spends a lot of time indoors with the kids?
Or maybe those other things are happening, because they are getting repoted in the news and the '"islamist uprising" is just a maturbatory fantasy of the non oppressed right? And my friend posts pics, everyday, of their trip walkimg all over Paris. Try again.
&gt; He contradicts himself constantly,

&gt; He's fundamentally unfit to be president

&gt; He's demonstrated himself to be nothing but narcissistic and self-serving

Examples then? **LOL**

Great article; here are just a few of the salient points:

&gt; ... Mateen was later removed from a terror watchlist after it was determined that he had broken no laws. The rest is history.
&gt; 
&gt; It joins abundant precedent. 
&gt; 
&gt; * The father of the so-called **underwear bomber** warned the U.S. authorities of his son's intentions to attack America, but they fell through the cracks.  
&gt; 
&gt; * The Russian government warned U.S. authorities the **Boston Marathon bombers** were radical Islamists more than a year and a half before they killed many and maimed more. As with Mateen, the feds found that no laws were violated. The brothers were sent on their way until they reappeared with a blast.  
&gt; 
&gt; * The Pentagon failed to recognize numerous signs that **Fort Hood shooter** Nidal Malik Hasan was up to no good and communicating with terrorists.  
&gt; 
&gt; * The extensive arsenal, recent Middle East travel, and correspondence with Islamist extremists of Syed Rizwan Farook did nothing to alarm the FBI before he and his wife massacred 14 people at a Christmas party in **San Bernardino**.  
&gt; 
&gt; * The famous complaint of Admiral David Beatty at Jutland -- "something is wrong with our bloody ships today" -- surely must apply to the State Department after **600 requests for security upgrades from the Benghazi consulate** failed to rouse Secretary Clinton to action.  
&gt; 
&gt; When asked how she could fail to see a telegraphed punch, Clinton could only say: "What difference, at this point, does it make?"

----------

&gt; The most disturbing aspect of recent terror attacks is that the authorities were taken by surprise each time despite advance warning. This serial failure undercuts the administration's claim to competence. 
&gt; 
&gt; The administration's demand for more gun control crucially rests on the claim of competence ... But if the administration fails to push back against hostile ideologies and screen refugees, opens the borders, and refuses to heed obvious warnings, the administration has effectively disabled the regulars and you are left with the militia.

----------

&gt; The administration has a security model that is not working. The FBI is looking for ordinary criminals and "hatemongers." Armed with these descriptions, they keep letting the usual suspects go because they don't fit the bill. Yet time and again they come back as a surprise.
&gt; 
&gt; **Maybe the greatest trick Islamic terrorism ever pulled was convincing Obama it didn't exist.**

hmmm. my theory/guess

now that Obama has suddenly jumped into the campaign to support Hiilbag and trash Trump...Putin is extra annoyed/pissed at the Wimp n Chief

I think Putin may not like Trump, but certainly respects Trump.  hence, Putin approves media missile strikes at the Hillbag which simultaneously destroy Barry (as if there was anything left of his credibility)

Twitter ...is it taking in stray mods from Reddit?  sure sounds like another cleansing over there

my solution has worked fine.  I never check my Twit but I do see Twit shit that gets repeated on some news shows, some links etc.  life is far more bearable like that
Yep where have the Republicans been the last 6 years?
Basically anything against the Democrat agenda means you are a nazi. You can't even take it seriously anymore. 
Fuck the UN I say we stop funding these assholes.
I did one of those isidewith.com questionnaires...  I had Ted Cruz at the top, then Austin Peterson (libertarian), and then Trump in third.  Hillary was way at the bottom.   I consider myself pretty conservative... why would Trump be less conservative than Killary?  or is that website just a load of BS?
geez, $500?  didn't know they were that cheap

but I still need a shotgun first so I'll wait before I spring for my **ASSAULT WEAPON**

yea, but all the sites I have read for personal protection (my goal) say 1. shotgun, then 2. hand gub
Once you accept that DHS is infiltrated by Jihadists and controlled by globalists, this makes perfect sense.

I have a feeling that Rand Paul would bring over some libertarians and never trumpers.
Rand needs to stay as far away from the Trump Shit Show as possible. Work hard in the Senate for another four years instead.
Looks like I was right to stop watching him. What a tool.
A radical Muslim kills 49 and injures more and Republicans come out and decry........Trump? Meanwhile Obama can't even pronounce the phrase "radical Islam" and although I hear conservative talk show hosts calling him out, Republicans are amazingly silent.

No wonder all the "top Republicans" where shellacked in the primaries. They're almost as out of touch as Democrats. They have only themselves to blame if Hillary wins.
Gotta hand it to the left, they've got great propaganda.
1.  Its a civil case, so there can be no "conviction," only a damages award;
2.  Curiel was appointed by Republican Governor Schwarzenegger to the state bench, and elevated to the federal bench by Obama;
3.  Federal judicial assignments are random, and this case was going on long before this election;
4.  The means to deal with judicial bias is to file a motion to recuse, which Trump has not done because he cannot meet his burden to prove bias.

note the part where it say adapting and surviving the environment. simplifying something like that down to "disease" is stupidity.  your environment is constantly changing and also includes other organisms of the same species. which means we are in constant competition for survival. "adapting" in our situation  would be arming ourselves in a way as to defend ourselves from the harm of other organisms.  unless you have a way to make your skin bulletproof. by all means tell us. but till then this meme will make perfect sense.

Ok, so voice of reason time. I'm not defending radical Islam, first of all.

The most dangerous people in this country are, according to the data, us. Natural-born citizens of the greatest country in the world. Religion doesn't dictate anything, any more than all Christians act like the Westboro Baptist church. 

If we exclude people based on religion, in a country that was founded to escape religious persecution, who the fuck are we, even?

Mitt Romney can't stand us.   lol.
He's come on board supporting Trump.  He bowed out when he lost Florida.

I don't love the guy, but the people of Florida could do worse.  They also could do better, but that's up to them.
He had potential, but he's been such a mess and hasn't played his hand very well.  He seems to have a habit of putting personal ambition and political expediency above principle.  He came on the scene as a tea partier and went straight to the Gang of Eight.  Since then he has been disillusioned with the Senate and has not been doing his job.  He sold out Jeb Bush to run for president this cycle when he obviously was not ready, contributing to the current mess.  Then he acted like a fool over Trump.  Once he was defeated, he said he wasn't running for Senator or Governor.  He seemed as if he was going to hold out against Trump but gave in and has offered lukewarm support, showing little backbone.  Now it appears he will be running for Senate again, which he didn't like, wasn't very good at, and had already essentially quit on.  He's the incumbent and the Republicans' best candidate, coming off a national campaign, and yet is struggling in polls against lesser known opponents.  If he had just stuck to the Senate for a couple of terms and gotten some experience he would have been much better off and the country may have been as well, but he was too impatient.  He might be their only chance to hold the seat, but he could lose, further damaging his brand, and even if he wins he will not be content and unless he changes his attitude will not be a very good Senator.
heard Hannity yesterday who mentioned he's for Rubio to throw in.  major reason:  he can win the seat for **R** which likely is true

punchline:  Hannity throws in "...and he's apologized over 100 times for his amnesty mistake."

LOL.  mistake?  shit, amnesty is core in Rubio's heart.  he'll vote the same as a **D** on that and all related subjects.

my bottom line IS NO HYPOCRITES ALLOWED, even "cute" young ones with **R** labels

btw, did you know he has a Cuban ancestry?

A little off topic but I get Rush notifications on my Android phone I guess because I listen to his shows. Linked me to a Huffington post article the other day after Rush started calling out Obama on blaming the Florida club shooter being radicalized by the internet, and that we need to do something about it. 

Rush made the comment this is the first attempt to gain control of the internet. Logical argument, especially since that's kind of how it sounded.

This Huffington Post article proceeded to shit on him about his views and how he had finally gone crazy......

How is a writers opinion on a radio hosts views news? I was shocked and really amazed that they couldn't even see a bit of a connection
I heard it, twice.  Limbaugh and Hannity were raving, but since I'd heard the data before, didn't seem that big to me.  what I did hear said was Trump will need to repeat the whole content DAILY, relentlessly, until the lame stream media are forced to cover the content.  right now, they're reporting "Trump is Clinton bashing" avoiding the details.  we'll see

I'm worried here in Florida as the radio ads from Hillbag are rolling and they're good.  she'll REPEAT them forever/daily.  we'll see
when we look under the hood versus look at lame stream media agenda headlines, America sees Trump under the hood

**OF COURSE** banning Muslims is correct...**OF COURSE**

that'll leave a stable number of maybe 5-10,000 terrorists already here to apprehend.  that's plenty / too much
What if the terrorist were white Anglo-Saxon Europeans? Would you want to ban all of Europe as well? Banning doesn't stop people from getting here. They'll just find other ways in. For example, illegal immigrants, human trafficking, drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, etc.
Umm He is 998M short. He is going to need a billion to get his ads on TV. 
&gt;what if terrorists were

There you go. Logical fallacy 
You can't call a hypothetical question a logical fallacy. 
What if spoons made people fat? Would you ban guns?

Nope... You are obviously correct... 

/s
good thing he's worth 10 billion 
He doesn't need many adds, the mainstream media is already shitting their pants over him.
Yes, in your hypothetical we should ban European immigrants until the regional immigrants could be properly vetted or the region stabilizes
He will have no trouble raising money when he needs it.  His potential donors haven't been bled dry like Bernie's and Hillary's have.
His face is all over the news in the primaries he got 2 billion of coverage for free. 
I thought he was self-funding his campaign. Guess you've been lied to again, suckers. 
It's pretty scary that the left hates us more than they hate terrorists. 
According to them, we cause terrorism.  
The 1040 ez is postcard simple... This isn't where the problem lies
For most people this is already true.  We need to take a multi-vector approach.  Reduced spending on non-discretionary items and lowering the tax rate for companies and individuals.  Don't even get me started on the removal of red tape. 
I'm calling for a postcard-simple tax return. I'm calling for a balanced budget, I'm calling for an end to war, an end to cancer, and ice cream after dinner every night.

It is really easy to call for things.
Both parties in congress would move to limit the power of the executive branch.  

I'm actually okay with that aspect.
Congress dislikes Trump. Collude to keep him from exposing them as not only dishonest but terrible liars.
**"Make sure he loses. Grit their teeth for four years and win the White House,”** Will said during an interview after his speech at a Federalist Society luncheon."

I believe that anyone who is a Conservative and/or Republican that isn't pushing for a Trump win is an idiot.  

Considering a Clinton win would guarantee a liberal Justice who couldn't care less about the Constitution, how could anyone who says they are a Conservative sit idly by just because they believe Trump isn't "Conservative enough".

I bet Will voted for Romney and he wasn't a Conservative.  These NeverTrump dipshits must be in an echo chamber of idiocy.



No opposition? Strongly disagree. By how much Congressional Republicans have already tried to throw Trump under the bus, I imagine a Republican-led Congress would be almost as much of a limiting factor to a Trump administration as a Democrat-led Congress.
He said he was self-funding his primary campaign. He did that. I certainly didn't expect him to self-fund the general. That's insane.
Good answer. Don't even buy into their race-baiting. 10/10
What's the selective pressure? The one in a few million that decides to kill innocent people? That's not normal selectivity and is an testament to our diversity. Moreover those people who kill others have no chance of survival usually, or even more so regarding procreation, fail to have children to carry on their genes. That is the definition of natural selection. 

Darwinism is inferred from natural selection. If you can understand Darwinism then you should understand natural selection. In that there will ALWAYS be aberrations from normal that may or may not provide an evolutionary advantage in certain niches. In that sense lone-wolf shooters will always be there but having guns kills many more innocent people than saving their lives. That's proven by statistics.

Also the amazing mind-gymnastics to accept that innocent gun deaths are like car accidents but accepting Middle-Eastern refugees somehow predisposes us to more danger. How many people have been killed by terrorism in the past 20 years? 3k in 9/11 and how many more since? How many gun deaths a year? 10k to 15k. Which one should you be more afraid of?

Stop being a fucking sheeple to the goal of terrorism; to incite fear in the general populace and turn people against one another. You think we're going to move off this planet and conquer space through division or though a unified global society that has addressed and minimized potential biological predisposition? If we in fact can treat mental illness; suicidal ideations, homicidal ideations, paranoia, etc it would be a huge leap for mankind. It's a fucking statistic in a 3rd world country and it should be a fucking statistic in the first world. Who the fuck cares in 10 years save for the minority of people who hold those tragic histories. 
When did he ever say he was only funding the primary before now? And since he's taking special interest money for the general that means he's bought and paid for. Pathetic!

Also, did you know that Trump's contributions to his campaigns are in the form of loans? Sad!
Well that's what they get for piggybacking planned parenthood funding restrictions. They new it would fail and now they can point the finger and it's clearly working. Democrats of course play the same game. It's bull shit really but no way will it ever change.
Zika is spread my mosquitos and traveling people. How is this related to immigration at all? 
Stop with the dump trump rhetoric.  It u s an unhelpful distraction
Seriously this - these guys just want Hillary to be president apparently and have no shits given about SCOTUS.
big big Trump fan here in Florida.  I'm a little worried because the Hillbag TV ads I'm seeing (heavy doses) are very good

not attacking Trump but glorifying Hillbag as a champion **of the children** and all things good.  scared because they're very good ads.  what say you?
issue after issue, Dems stomp **R** like roaches.  frankly, it's far from equal matching

**R** = clueless, Dems = professional manipulators

on the other side, it's mostly show, right?  a billion dollars with no urgency, no mandate.  Hillary is what's important
well, for me, Kasich can stay home either way

Cruz should come kiss the ring.  Cruz moralized to the stratosphere in his final weeks and needs to smooth things over and do as he claimed was critical, **UNITE**
Remember when Trump said he may not support the winner if he wasn't nominated and he was blasted because they all sign a document stating that exact promise? 




yup, all fact
Cruz and Kasich on a beach somewhere sipping margaritas -.  "Fine".
Isn't it an event run by the RNC?  Trump hasn't been nominated for anything yet and isn't the chairman, it shouldn't be his decision.  It's a party convention, not a Trump coronation.  There isn't room for dissenting voices?
all I think I know is Rush and Hannity say Trump is in charge of content
Only if the party committee lets him; it's not a God-given right.
Yes, it's technically ran by the RNC and they have the final say in a lot of stuff *but* the entire convention's purpose is to nominate Trump as the party candidate. So it has been generally understood that the candidate's campaign gets a great deal of control over what happens. 

You think the Republican party is in chaos now imagine if they told Trump he had no say in who spoke at the convention. He could very well not bother to show up and it would be a complete disaster. Send a gold covered letter thanking them for nominating him and then give a speech somewhere else.

&gt;There isn't room for dissenting voices?

There's a time and place for that. The party convention, once the nomination is secured which it is, is not the place for dissenting voices. At some point you have to either accept the democratically decided nominee, change parties, or take a break from politics. 
There seem to be quite a few delegates not quite ready to throw in the towel. They may be just a noisy minority but they will be there. I realize that conventions have turned into what you describe, but technically they are a business meeting to determine the nominee and perform other functions such as writing the platform. Reasonable people can disagree. It seems healthy to welcome all, have your debates and discussion, vote, and emerge united. Instead they are shutting out a lot of people - candidates, office holders, party elders - plus their supporters, who instead are either leaving the party permanently or sitting out this cycle because the party doesn't even want to acknowledge them or their viewpoints. 

I understand they are trying to achieve party unity. Unfortunately they are attempting to accomplish that by demanding blind obedience rather than through building consensus and tolerating difference of opinion. 
&gt;... but technically they are a business meeting to determine the nominee 

But in this case the nominee is already determined. Delegates are bound to vote for a certain candidate and there are enough delegates bound to Trump that he will be elected. The voting part of the convention is simply going through the motions of a decision that's already been made.

&gt;Reasonable people can disagree. It seems healthy to welcome all, have your debates and discussion, vote, and emerge united. Instead they are shutting out a lot of people - candidates, office holders, party elders - plus their supporters, who instead are either leaving the party permanently or sitting out this cycle because the party doesn't even want to acknowledge them or their viewpoints.

*Reasonable people* should recognize that the debates and discussions have happened. If they don't like Trump then they lost. It's over. There is no reason to debate. Frankly, if they can't accept a Trump nomination then they should not be there. Good or bad the party had a vote and Trump was elected. Nothing can change that. You may not be a fan of Trump, I'm certainly not, but until it becomes the Restore_Democracy party it isn't up to you.

And I find your username quite ironic in that you seem to not be in favor of democracy. Democracy means having a vote and then accepting the decision of the people. Those who wish to make noise at the convention are not accepting the decision of the people. Without that acceptance we cannot have a good democracy. It doesn't mean you have to be happy about it or that you can't work hard to get a different outcome at the next election but it means accepting the decision of this election.

&gt;Unfortunately they are attempting to accomplish that by demanding blind obedience rather than through building consensus and tolerating difference of opinion.

Not blind obedience. Acceptance of a decision that was made. No one is saying you can't have a different opinion. They're saying if you want to be party of what is effectively Trump's kick-off party then you should be on board with a Trump nomination. If you're not then why are you there? Go start your own dictatorship where the will of the people isn't respected.
Well, it seems to be in question still whether the delegates are legally bound or not, but not my concern. They can do what they like, it's a private organization. If they want to make it smaller and less inclusive, they can do so whether I and others believe that to be in their long-term best interests or not. 

The only way to get Clinton elected was to nominate her old pal Trump, and you've probably managed to do it with the support of a minority of the party. Why Republican primary voters want to hand her the election I don't understand, but that's their prerogative. The people will have their say, Clinton will be elected by a plurality, and the majority who didn't support her will have to live with it including the impact on the Supreme Court for the next generation. I know you'll be ok with that. I won't like it but I'll accept it of course, and I'll exercise my right to dissent, one of the benefits of our constitutional democracy. 
Seems fair. Someone that breaks their promise and then effectively tries to help Hillary by not endorsing their party's candidate has no place at the convention. Maybe they'd feel more at home in Philadelphia?
You know Kasich is somewhere engulfing a huge plate of pasta.
&gt; Maybe they'd feel more at home in Philadelphia?

yea, I'm thinking Romney and Kasich would
On a beach somewhere far from Cleveland...
Why were provisions added to the bill regarding the Confederate Flag, Planned Parenthood, pesticides, etc?!? These riders were added by the GOP. It should have been a clean bill with an up or down vote. This was an attempt to force the Democrats to allow Republican talking points through, or to make them deny a bill ostensibly marked purely as one helping deal with the Zika situation in order to shame them and draw dishonest support. It's pretty embarrassing.
I feel he's right to censure them. They signed a pledge saying they'd do something and now they're not keeping their word. At the beginning of the primaries, I liked Kasich and was sad he was losing. Now my appreciation of him is starting to wear a little thin.

Also, when can we start to ignore arguments based on polls? They've been wrong before with regards to Trump and seem to be a tool for promoting a narrative rather than predicting results. (Ex: the hundredth time polls told us Trump was *right on the cusp of losing support* during the primary.)
Everybody hates Donald Trump. He's a thin-skinned asshole with a big mouth.
&gt; the hundredth time polls told us Trump was right on the cusp of losing support during the primary.

I'm not sure if you follow the news or read this article, but Trump is losing support everywhere. 

Record number of Republican voters turned out for him so not everyone hates him. He's our nominee like it or not it's the will of the demos. 
Big Mouth Asshole Trump
Kek RIP nevertrump
That's why he's winning in the last poll that was released right 
This is such a tired narrative.
The same politicians have a proven record of lying to get elected then sucking Obama's cock. No surprise they lied with their pledge. 
That pledge was a blatant case of a bunch of idiots thinking 'Heh heh, there is no way Trump's going to win, so this is just a good PR thing to hit him with when he loses and one of us becomes the candidate.'
Has had every position on abortion possible to name one of a hundred. 

He has recommended committing not one, but two war crimes as part of his campaign (even one would be disqualifying) 

He literally puts his brand name on everything and even admitted that he didn't expect to do this well, but that the campaign would have been a great way to get a TV show and help his brand/business.   

Pretty easy to answer. 
Did you see that crowd?
No intent?! What a crock of shit. "I didn't intend to speed, officer!"

I guess I can't say I'm surprised. 
entitled executive syndrome

as i said in another thread

&gt; as a security researcher i can assure you that virtually anyone else who set up their own unsecured email server and began transmitting classified material over it would be rotting in a cell - especially if said email server had literally been hacked by foreign hackers
I keep waiting to hear a legal expert weigh in on this. It seems like some things need to be clarified.

For instance, Comey's lack of recommendation to indict seems to be unconnected to Clinton's guilt in the matter.

According to Comey, "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case" because all previous cases prosecuted involved, among other things, "clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information."

So while "there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information," it wouldn't normally be prosecuted because Clinton didn't intentionally mishandle the info.

However, this runs against something Comey said in the beginning of his speech, where he referenced a federal statue "making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally **or in a grossly negligent way**"

Per this statement, it shouldn't matter whether Clinton intended to mishandle info or did it by accident. It's a felony either way. Yet "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case."

It's an interesting contradiction.

All the quotes I used are from a [transcript of Comey's statement](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b.-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clintons-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system).
You should be scared. Hillary has basically secured Florida. You can thank Donald Trump's horrible response to the Orlando shootings for that.
LOL someone ought to tell him that there is no more food to be had

"If you don't vote for Hillary, you're voting for Trump!"

-Democrats

Seriously, can we stop this nonsense?  This false dichotomy is a big factor in why our politics have gotten so f*cked in the first place, let's not throw gas on the fire.
How is it false? First-past-the-post voting systems devolve into 2 party systems.
I figured Walker would follow the [Buckley rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley_Jr.#Buckley_Rule) eventually.
Walker is and has been the most sane of the original 17 and amongst the most prominent Republicans.  I **GO NUTS** reading the **INSANE** Trump bashing from the likes of Red State, Romney, George Will and the rest of the asylum write-ins. Let's not leave out McCain, Lindsey Graham, and maybe Cruz...who is still pouting/crying

in stark contrast, Democrats **ALWAYS ALWAYS** come together for the greater cause:  defeating Republcians (which usually works)
I don't think this is nonsense. 

The theory is that there is a pool of hypothetical votes. And there are only two meaningful possibilities.

So if you have 100 voters, let's say that 50 vote Dem, 49 vote GOP, and 1 votes 3rd Party. Even though that 1 vote was not a vote FOR Dem, it created a +1 result for Dem. 

The theory only holds if you're someone who would, if forced, vote for GOP over Dem. If the same person who would, if forced, vote for GOP over Dem DOESN'T vote it still creates a +1 result for Dem.

Another theory I've heard is that voting is your right and you should just vote for whoever you want to be president. Whether the person has a chance or not, your vote is your voice and you should just follow your conscience. I don't think this theory is inherently wrong or immoral.

Personally I am interested in arresting the Liberal agenda and policies, so I vote strategically.

It isn't. The only viable argument for voting 3rd party is that it influences the other parties platforms. It's the same reasoning that Sanders (who was 3rd party before this election) uses for staying in the race. 

I don't really know that it holds up and the way Trump, Sanders and even Cruz did it has been more effective. The Tea Party and Trump have changed the Republican party more in a few years than voting 3rd party has in...well ever, same for Sanders on the other side.
Sanders was hoping for an indictment. Because he needs the Democratic ticket to have a chance at winning. 
I don't think he expected or was hoping for an indictment. He's never had anything like the exposure for his ideas or opportunity to spread his political philosophy before. He's capitalizing on it and hoping to push the Democratic party further left. 
Except everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that this year we have:

1. Two candidates who are at record-breaking unfavorability measures
2. The largest 3rd party in terms of polling since Ross Perot
3. A great deal of complaint from all sides regarding our two-party system
4. The 3rd party ticket in question has a phenomenal track record of popularity in the blue states where each candidate governed.
5. When polls include the Johnson/Weld option, it brings HILLARY down to about 37%.

And with #5 I'll go back to my original point that the left is lamenting the Libertarian ticket as much or more than the right.  I think the Bernie supporters and the collective NeverHillary movement is every bit as strong or stronger than the NeverTrump.

So I'll ask again...why are we spreading this nonsense?  Why is the Libertarian ticket, comprised of two former Republican governors, just automatically written off by so many people here, rather than considered as a very valid option when compared to the two alternatives?
Because Democrats get the Statist voters. Bernie supporters are Statists. 

Libertarians get the Small Government voters. 

Ergo, Libertarian ticket hurts GOP more than Dem.
This is useful for character assassination but against Trump I'm not so sure that it will be a super effective attack. Trump himself has flipped on most issues (abortion, healthcare, etc.).
Are you sure that Democrats always unite? I keep seeing polls that show roughly half of Bernie supporters vowing that they would rather vote Trump than Hillary.
whatever glitches sometimes appear are a pittance compared with their usual cohesiveness 
Newspaper from a liberal city- Check

Cucks want to see Hillary in the White House.
The Democrat politicians are good at goose-stepping but the voters themselves aren't like that. I guess that's why I still have a tiny bit of hope for America. Remember the Reagan Democrats.
Everybody opposes violence. Or more precisely, everybody opposes *some* violence, such as violence against people they identify with or care about. Even the extremely violent do that. Thinking BLM is against violence in general doesn't really square with the continual results.
She always points to her "record" but never actually any specifics. It's pretty funny, actually.
&gt; She always points to her "record" but never actually any specifics

it works with the low information crowd.  what lately has me concerned here in Florida, the TV ads are **sensational**.  no mention of of politics, just "the children", "the oppressed", "the poor" blah blah blah.  the production quality is HUGE.  makes you think **this MUST be a great lady**
Right. People want to hate hillary and blame Democratic leaders but the true issue is the ignorance and lack of caring that a large part of our population has. They allow themselves to be exploited.
The only way that absolutely guarantees that Clinton or Trump is elected is to vote for either one of them.

Before I respond, know that I didn't read either the op article, or yours. And I don't plan on reading either because neither really interest me. 

Setting aside any bias from either source (yours is Washington post), the biggest thing about your article that makes it "irrelevant" is that it was written in September of last year. So much has changed between then and now, especially with polls and political variances, that even posting something from a few months ago might not hold wieght. 
&gt; Before I respond, know that I didn't read either the op article, or yours. And I don't plan on reading either because neither really interest me.

Yeah, maybe you should read them before commenting.
After skimming your article, it criticises polling numbers of presidential candidates from almost a year ago, before anyone was considered the nominee, whereas OP's article, written in June of this year, is about a poll that just *recently* came out. My point still stands. You post criticisms about last year's polling numbers, op posts about a poll recently done. Like I said, so much has changed, and there will probably be more change, that ops article will probably be outdated after the first nominee debate. But as of right now, your source of rebuttal is pretty much irrelevant.

Kendal Unrah is a complete piece of shit. My wife and I know her through the Colorado Springs Christian community my wife grew up in. 


Unrah legitimately believes dinosaurs are a mythical test of faith whose fossils were planted by God, her history curriculum completely cuts out the influence of the pagan Greek city states and Roman Republic/Empire on American government and Western history, she presents every "good" founding father as sharing theology with modern evangelicals, she's anti-vaccine, and presents the moon landing as a sin because humanity wasn't meant to leave the planet God made for us.


She also believes that America's PRIMARY geopolitical role should be protecting Israel and helping accelerate Christ's return.


She's a VERY COMMON breed of loon in Colorado Springs. Understand the people fighting Trump's nomination when they say they must vote "ethically" or whatever.



EDIT: oh, and she's hinted on Facebook that she's REALLY after the fame and attention of being the one to stop Trump. Though her language was far more self-righteous

Tim Scott is a good guy. If he says that blacks are unfairly profiled then I believe it.
Its a head fake.  I wouldnt be upset if its Pence but Trump is playing 4D chess with the media.
He cancelled his announcement tomorrow. He said it was because of the attack in Nice, but I'll bet that it was because of the backlash against Nice. Attack or no, this "leak" was probably him testing the waters. I'll bet that the anonymous "source" was either Trump himself or his staff. 
Seems like a safe choice. Christie is too unpopular in his home state and Newt has a ton of baggage. Pence is generally well liked without any scandals I'm aware of, while having a lot of conservative bona fides.
Arent tax returns public record? 
that would never happen pfffft what are you, a racist? Sexist pig.
no, private, but release is traditional for presidential candidates.  however, Trump has balked because he is under audit right now

To bad Gary Johnson's not even near conservative.

He's libertarian, which at times can be much worse.
The Bush loves the Johnson
It's not settled? Did I miss something?

Unbelievable that this piece of crap is helping to run a political party. Only the Democrats!!!!!!

Honest Democrat.

Lol.
don't ya just LOVE how clueless Donahue is?  he's up against a genius but thinks he's just an economist who can't possibly TOTALLY DESTROY his gooey greasy liberal notions of truth and reality in about 2 minutes.  a lifetime of liberalism...poof...up in smoke

So?
If you walk down the libertarian party platform it mirrors Trump's.  Their long term goals are nowhere near conservative, but the actual platform of less government is the same. Trump is states' rights for example (federal legalization of drugs, no department of ed, etc).  

Johnson is way further to the left of Trump on foreign issues.  Is Trump a social moderate like most libertarians?...yes he is.  But Johnson goes even further than most conservatives would be willing to go. which is why im surprised to see people say their conservative values will not let them vote Trump, and then talk about voting Johnson.  
*Johnson is for the complete withdraw of membership in the UN.  
*Johnson is pro isolationism.   
*Johnson is pro legalization of ALL drugs.  
*Johnson is for the removal of ALL foreign aid to our our allies, including Israel.  

These views should be very upsetting to conservatives.  and IMHO alot more than Trumps stances on social issues.
If hillary killed those americans, then are ISIS terrorists scot free?

Um stupid you do understand that Actor A and Actor B can both be responsible for their part in action C, correct? 
And therefore you're saying military commanders should take be tried the same way as enemy combatants?
Those are just people who backed Cruz and are stilled pissed he lost so they're throwing tantrums.
Try again stupid ... Also the Military is NOT above the law ... They just are NOT.  There is NOTHING about 'should' stated by me ... Maybe your DUMB ass needs to get some more IQ points? Save the 'liberal' insult ... since coming from you is simply means 'well read and intelligent'.
You're not making sense here friend. Maybe take a deep breath and try again?
Of course she's worse than Obama. The last president 'better than Obama' was Teddy Roosevelt.

Former Republican here. The party left me years ago with the start of the "Tea Party" within the GOP. This is no longer the, "Party of Lincoln". It's become the party of racism, segregation and exclusion.

Like porn? What a fucking joke this party has become. This primary will be my last GOP vote by choice. It's Libertarian or Independent THEN GOP. Only thing good about them now is there actually a few hold outs who still believe in small government. 

The rest is fucked. Johnson/Weld 2016.

The path of liberalism will always lead to big government.  I'm afraid there are no candidates running this year anti big government.
Liberalism or liberalism? Gary wants to cut the federal government by 1/5th. That's a far cry better than the GOP nominee. 
In one topic.  We could line up every candidate, and probably find something from each we like.  But Johnson on the whole is for more liberal than people are letting on.
Once again, liberal or Liberal? Liberalism is the philosophy on which we were founded, liberalism is for the idea of big government, and big spending. 
Liberal in the first definement:1.
open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional values.  
The very values our founders rallied around set us up for National as well as personal success.  The altering of the process to make things more "fair" is the very definition of liberalism.  
In Johnson's case his stances on things such as drugs, goes completely against what our knowledge and common sense tells us about them.  to adopt a more open policy, while getting gov. out, is still what alot of conservatives would view as a liberal policy.
platform seems not to matter.  Trump has actual proposals to go with, but is behind in all the polls.  America is voting progressive.  America is over
Whats wrong with removing criminal penalties for drugs? Treating addiction as a social and medical condition is not a liberal POV. Its the correct thing to do after years of drug policy failure. I have never understood why to be conservative you have to be blind to the fact that addiction is a disease that doesn't get fixed by putting people in jail.
They want to legalize it all.  You will never convince me that is the "right" thing to do.  You can already put more  emphasis on drug rehab instead of actual jail time served.  If you want to argue that, then I'm with you.  But, the drugs still need to be illegal, and the major  distributors of those drugs still need to go to jail.
No one is arguing that distributors shouldn't be jailed. If you have a source on Johnson stating such I would love to see a source. Unfortunately you can't keep it illegal and focus on treating it as a medical issue. If its illegal people have to be taken through the criminal justice system. Keeping it illegal and focusing on rehab is the same bullshit of states having legal weed which is against federal law, and the federal government looking the other way.  If its legal we can pursue other ways to deal with it. The WOD has been a colossal failure and if we keep trying to deal with these issue in that way and failing we aren't doing the "right" thing.
That's why I would argue people convicted should be sentenced to rehab instead of jail time.  And as far as what Gary Johnson has said, just look up the Libertarian debates that fox business hosted. He said in the debates that the only punishment to drug offenders should be the pain of being a drug user.  
  
     You will possibly run into problems if you legalize drugs and then try to convict people for distributing a "legal" substance.  That's why I'd be more in favor of keeping drugs illegal, but severely limiting the sentencing for first or second time drug users.
It doesn't work like that. If you keep it illegal and just force rehab you are still burdening the addict with a criminal record, public records, newspaper reports etc. What happens when you force someone to rehab for their illegal drug use, they recover. They are now trying to come back into the workforce and be a productive tax paying citizen. Unfortunately there criminal record follows them and they can't. There fast food job pays them minimum wage, they live below the poverty line and our taxes go towards there welfare, there medical insurance, etc. The hardest part of a addict is after jail. Its so easy to slip back into that life style when the world has stacked the chips against you.

This is why I don't understand the conservative viewpoint. You are essentially burdening society by making these addicts criminals. Even if they never serve jail time there burden on society is high when the world is against them.

Yes Johnson said "only punishment to drug offenders should be the pain of being a drug user." I don't believe that states there shouldn't be trafficking and distributor punishments. Lets face it the big guys in the cartels are not using like the addicts are.
That's why we push for reform like: completion of drug rehab drops criminal record.  
We are technically in agreement.  I understand everything you are saying. I just think we can accomplish everything that needs to be done with more common sense reform (without the need of legalization).
It is extremely hard to drop a criminal record. Even if a judge drops it the original arrest record exists and will be found by employers. We would have to change the way the judicial systems handles arrest records and court records. We also already do similar things with addicts in drug court and with minors with diversion. To me it just seems silly to make it illegal and then add all these band aids to try to help people since it is illegal. I think we both have the same end goal but have different thoughts on how to approach it.
Exactly, and that's what makes politics so heated.

You're the only sane one here... 
Trump just doesn't have the mental capacities to be president.
if you think so.
I do. I'm Republican, but I'm not for this nut job anymore. We've drifted right into crazy town. I've watched him speak numerous times, tried to force myself to enjoy him but... he's just so fucking dumb and egotistical.

I'm all about that Johnson now! 
if you like him, ok just remember what he stands for.  I really dont know why every conversation has to go to Trump, or why people have to continue to repeat to everone thats in ear shot, that they hate him.
Because he'd be the one leading the country. Unfortunately I think he's an embarrassment. That's why it keeps coming back to it. I'd rather split the vote, go Johnson, and watch the party take a hard look at itself with a phenomenal flop.  
well i personally like Trump over the rest of the field, so i will be pulling for him.
Right on, all the power to you
to you as well.
There are really are only two options which are effective.

* Hang all drugs dealers
* Legalize and control all drugs with severe penalties to those who thwart the system

The US is in between, where drugs are consumed and sometimes socially acceptable while all the while still illegal and can get you a very long prison term.  The so called "War on drugs" has been a complete failure.  Choose one of the options.
Nope, I refuse that those are the only two options.  I'd say cut some red tape and mandate that drug users serve rehab instead of jail time. There are simply some drugs that needs to remain illegal, and I'm not talking marijuana.  That's one drug where I don't think it's necessarily a killer drug.  
The very idea of getting government out of the way is that the individual can think for themselves and they don't need Uncle Sam holding their hands, but with drugs like Desomorphine the individual on the drug loses their abilities to think about normal drug free life. The dependence is extremely high and on top of that it destroys body tissue.  To bad they no longer have the ability to say no.  
I don't know about you, but I'm extremely happy that we don't have drugs like I've mentioned readily available on our streets, but if you legalize all the drugs there's no telling.

Yes. It's really kinda the fiscally responsible thing to do.

Everyone has drawn lines in the sand about what's left and what's right, when really we need to take a hard look at what would benefit conservatives and focus less on apeasing evangelicals.

If we'd stop guilting abortions, we'd have a lot less children born into families without the means to take care of them. As cruel as it sounds, it's the truth.

The current party has lost me,  a moderate conservative with trump, unfortunately. And they're going to keep losing voters like me if they keep pursuing the religious right. Have you heard Mike Pences built bullshit? It's clear what direction they want to go and I can't support that.
Criminal record = no jobs unfortunately. And a huge majority of crime is pushing drugs, and doing anything for the next fix.
That's why we change the sentencing for drug users, to serving drug rehab, to maintain a clean arrest record.  That way it's still a crime to push these drugs, but you're also doing something to help them, and taking care of the jail overcrowding at the same time.
And the next time they fuck up? 
I don't think there would be any difference in cost to send someone to rehab rather than jail.  So I'd say keep trying to help them.  But we really need to keep it illegal so we can still try to eliminate the pushers and cooks. 
Two week rehab vs how long in jail? 

Honestly,  decriminalize using it. Addicts are victims. There is no net gain here for them. Make it easy for them to get help. 

Keep distribution illegal. Take away the pushers and you'll have a lot of people begging for rehab with a chance at bettering themselves after. Can't do shit with a criminal record.
We are practically in agreement, as not affecting the criminal record would mean the use of drugs would be decriminalized.
Everyone on this sub is a degenerate, republicans are the bane of the united states.
This is horrifying
Establishment cucks supporting libcucks. I'm surprised.

And how exactly is Obama bad? What paranoid delusions and fantasies do you hold that make you think that Obama has been a bad President?

Did he try to take your gun away? Did he try to convert you to Islam? Did he make you have an abortion? Did he raise your taxes? Did he invade any countries and get your son killed?

And most sane people would agree that George W. Bush is the worst President ever. And now you have come up with Donald Trump???

I see you're one of those "libertarians" who defines "free trade" as heavily regulated by huge government...

Now run back to /r/libertarian and let everyone know what a good faux-libertarian you are.
the TPP will give foreign 3rd world countries the ability to create US Internet law. now move along  CTR employee. 
It's not our fault they are only paying you minimum wage to spread lies online.
To be honest while I support Trump this guy was quite appealing, he believed in free trade, upholding the constitution and smaller governments although there was some insane policies as well like open door immigration. Since his nomination he has become unbearable to watch, his negligence to one of the most criticised trade deals is astounding.
Also why does he always talk about climbing and hiking, no climbing a mountain does not make you more qualified.
[deleted]
TPP really isn't free trade.  It's 5500 pages of protectionism.  
But my morals, I must protect my morality and vote Johnson. /s
[deleted]
a simple tariff would be 100x better.  and since it was used before the income tax as basically the only major federal income, it kept government small and the incidence of taxation was on foreign corporations.  
[deleted]
And I am in agreement with you, I'm just saying I have just lost the last shred of faith in Johnson.
I have several guns and I absolutely think handguns are more dangerous than rifles. You have to know how to shoot a rifle. Any idiot can watch tv and think they'll know what to do when they pick up a handgun, which is incredibly dangerous in and of itself. I have a concealed carry as well so I know how easy it is for a criminal to sneak that thing around. It's a lot harder to hide a whole damn rifle.

I wish there were better crime statistics on what weapons were used in homicides and assaults, because I sure as hell bet that it's more handguns. Then maybe the media could get off of their silly "assault weapons" nonsense.
But then he goes on to say we should prevent people on no fly list form buying guns.
Me too
It's either your morals or your guns
 
Trump seems to be the strongest on it. Also I acknowledge that I probably walked into a debate trap. 
[Hillary Clinton is a great and qualified presidential candidate!](http://i.imgur.com/6OtZ0fo.jpg)
#SPICY
If that's the only choice you give,  I'll take my guns.
Handguns are absolutely used in more crime. 
I don't know much about the politics for this issue? Isn't the no fly list difficult to get on? I definitely don't want suspected terrorists able to buy guns.
The liberty party is now anti-gun and open borders...
You're not big on due process are you.
That isn't my point though. There isn't due process for Guantanamo either. I admitted I am not fully educated on the topic but unless the no fly list is something that people get added to without reason frequently I don't understand why it isn't a good list of suspected terrorists. 
'Liberty'
People can be put on it without due process and there is no process for getting off of it. There have been reports already of people getting on the list without good reason. The idea that the government can just take away someones rights without a court conviction is a pretty big issue to me.
And you are a big meanyhead who only sees their side of the coin.

Two faces on the same coin, and we are all screwed because of it.
That was beautiful.

Maybe there is hope. Fuck the polls.

This just in: Joe Biden revealed information that isn't a secret! More at 11 on Breitbart. 

Seriously, this isn't some top secret thing. There are movies about the football. There's a Wikipedia page about the football. There's all kinds of official documentation about the football. Everyone knows there are codes in briefcases at all times.
/u/Kevin_Milner posts several shitposts/reposts from garbage websites a minute. This is one of half a dozen from a single MINUTE.
There's nothing secret about the guy following the President and Vice President carrying a jacket with a bag under it, nor what's in his bag.  In fact awareness of this person ensures Americans are aware that their leaders are capable of nuclear attack or defense, if necessary.  That promotes a sense of national security.  What Biden did is not hypocritical...in fact he makes a great point.  The codes are never far, and Trump gets all worked up from tweets and throws a tantrum.  Should he have nuclear codes within arms reach?

Bullshit. Yes, we know our leaders can launch a nuclear attack. I don't think anyone's forgotten. We don't need to literally know every detail about it, nor the identify of the guy carrying an important piece of that infrastructure. You really hate Trump that much that you're now defending idiotic Democrats that can't keep anything secret?

&gt; The codes are never far, and Trump gets all worked up from tweets and throws a tantrum. Should he have nuclear codes within arms reach?

You also forgot to mention that Trump kicks babies and is literally being paid by Putin to assassinate Mexicans. What is CTR paying you for if you're going to screw up their talking points? No wonder you have more karma in /r/SandersForPresident than here...
&gt;You really hate Trump that much that you're now defending idiotic Democrats that can't keep anything secret?

I call 'em as I see 'em.  The man throws tantrums from tweets.  Are you saying he doesn't?  I'll repeat it again, there is nothing secret about the guy following the President and Vice President carrying a jacket with a bag under it.  Don't like it, make it a secret I guess?

Wow, medication time!  Everyone's not out to get you and everyone who doesn't support you 100% isn't paid by someone to oppose you.   And CTR?  What is that?  Click through rate?  Center for Transportation Research?  Google isn't helpful but maybe you're referring to Close Target Reconnaissance...that sounds cool. 

I don't care wherever I get karma on Reddit.  Karma comes and karma goes.  So is the universe.  Beautiful, really.  Like one big symphony.

Lol you must be in some strong denial if you think this is true. 
That Democrats have failed black Americans?








That's a fact.
He's right.
Poor people have been voting for democrats for 50 years - still poor. 
And the Republicans haven't because it's not an issue worth dealing with. Although it's easy pointing fingers at others for not doing well when you haven't even attempted the challenge. 
Removing the liberal policies that have destroyed black neighborhoods and other neighborhoods (but blacks neighborhoods are more affected) is definitely worth the effort because the result will be more employed individuals and a better economy in the cities and country, lower violent crime rates in cities, fewer drugs on the streets and generally a happier population.











Milwaukee hasn't had a Republican mayor in over 150 years, and in all that time, not only are they worse off, but they had a riot last week where they burned down their own neighborhoods and then blamed white Republicans for all their problems...
It's true. But so have republicans. 
If Paul Ryan and 'War Hero' McCain can stop sabotage President Trump's campaign, he will have more time to tell his message to the black voters. 
He better comes to the meeting with the cash we need to build the wall! Better still, take some Mexicans criminals back on his way home!
Just citing some sources:
~ people employed directly by coal: http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Coal_and_jobs_in_the_United_States ~Blockbuster video: http://www.ibtimes.com/sad-end-blockbuster-video-onetime-5-billion-company-being-liquidated-competition-1496962
And remember, this is blockbuster alone. This does not include hollywood video or any other video rental store.

Damn those government restrictions on movies and games, taking away thousands of families livelyhoods!
I don't think being a coal worker can be compared to an entry level retail position.

And it's not like the government started regulating the distribution of DVDs.

Also, between Netflix and Redbox there is no reason for Blockbuster to exist. It's a straight upgrade to the old system with no disadvantages. Energy is complicated, and there is no easy and clear straight upgrade. 

In the town I grew up we had a little clean coal plant that produced the energy for our city, but now it's being shut down, and they've had to build a massive system of large power lines from a nearby major city, and they've had to demolish 90 miles of trees and wildlife habitat to put in these lines. 

Just regulating away coal sounds great on paper, but on the ground it's more complicated. 
Does that take into account the votes bought by Hillary? 
I can really agree with you. Ideal versus actuality are most often radically different from each other. but if we ask/demand/other action words more as citizens that replacement industry and new power be a bigger conversation early on, we can better plan for the future.

"So-called" .... ?
I guess their son was just on vacation in Iraq.
What garbage. Trump screwed up attacking them, and now that Breitbart's Exec is on Trump's campaign, they're doubling down on his mistake rather than backing away from it. How the hell could running with something like this benefit anything?
These are people who can snatch catastrophe from the jaws of defeat.

Trump screwed up on this one. Let it go Breitbart, this ones not worth fighting.
Khizr Khan seems to be involved with bringing potential terrorists into the country. Trump hasn't said anything racist. Looks like Breitbart has taken Stephanopoulos off his high chair and Mr Trump has plenty of very good red meat to throw to us during the debates when the Mods bring it up.

I definitely think she and her husband are behind Vince Foster's death. Editing to add that I believe it was not suicide.
A little misleading. The data in the article shows that the percentage of registered Republicans in the states mentioned is flat to down, but that the percentage of registered Democrats is falling even faster. So what is really happening is a shift to independent and third-party registration. Republicans may have less of a registration gap, but to take advantage of that they need to appeal to those independents. 
This guy needs to be fired.

I was disappointed that he pretended that the 11 million non-criminal illegal immigrants are "not a priority". His campaign of no amnesty, go home and get in line, but then to say we'll only accept people with degrees does nothing to solve the underlying immigration issue. That policy is exactly why people come here illegally - because a legal path is too difficult or impossible. Why go home if you know you won't be let back in? 
A legal path is too difficult or impossible because there is no need for the labor and too much potential social cost. The best answer is to make it difficult for these people to enter and to encourage them to leave. 

Why allow these people in except through a diversity lottery system?
&gt;Why go home if you know you won't be let back in?

'Because you've got more to lose by staying than leaving' will work just fine.
it is just a tactic to shut the liberal hippies up. I think he can use executive order to deport every single Mexican in our country. He can also promise a blanket pardon to all militia so they can go out and hunt down the Mexicans. If a Mexican resists, he should be shot on sight.  In 10 days we will solve the whole illegal immigrant situation.

How is that? 
Like Obama's executive order to clear Guantanimo on his first day in office? Your second suggestion would be ground for impeachment and possibly a trip to the Hague.
You seem to treat 'solving the underlying immigration issue' as a matter of getting rid of illegal immigrants. Your view then seems to come down to 'The only way to get rid of them is to make it so they can all become legal citizens - then they won't immigrate here illegally!'

There's an alternative: 'Make it so staying here as an illegal is worse than just staying home.' Most illegals are economic migrants. Just make it a losing proposition and we're in shape. Granted, easier said than done, but all we need is the will to go after employers and start seizing assets.

The problem will in large part be solved.
It is just these type of traditional attacks on republicans that left real republicans unable to articulate to one another what is wrong with Trump. When the serious people tried to tell trumpkins that he was an unelectable candidate due to his comments they could say "Romney was called racist and almost won." When they tried to say trump was seen as out of touch they could say "Romney hated poor people." When they tried to say trump lacks policy specifics they could say, "the Dems always say republicans are just the party of No." When the real conservatives said trump was really a liberal trump's goons could parrot Sean Hannity and say, "Romney and McCain are RINOs, Mitch and Boehner capitulated..." 

Basically the media (both sides) has made all legitimate criticism of republicans as ineffective with many republicans because they're used to hearing republicans take crap from both sides constantly. 
Like requiring e-verify and upping the budget for workplace enforcement line the comprehensive immigration reform currently dead in the house would have provided. 

Trump went from deport everyone to look these guys have never been the issue, and I'm just shocked more of his supporters aren't upset about it. 
Bingo. When they call everyone a racist...no one is.
Yea but I still worry because sooooooooo many hear racist racist racist  10,000 times and they say YEA! RACIST (CNN told me so)

&gt; First, he’s completely exposing the utter hypocrisy of the corporate sports industry.

no that's **not FIRST**.  what is first is his dumbness, then Dwayne Wade's stupidity, then Cam Newton's imbecility...etc is that either they don't know or refuse to speak the whole truth

partial truth:  yes, black people get killed by police force

but these punks act like that's "the problem".  never never ever do they discuss the baseline of violent black deaths:  **BLACKS**

never mind and never mention that **93%** of black homicides are [via black perpetrators](http://www.dailywire.com/news/7441/7-statistics-you-need-know-about-black-black-crime-aaron-bandler)

"Blacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do."

what speech can they make now?  if facts are included, the sit-on-the-bench idiots have no case, no case whatsoever
But thats when the Democratic party was conservative.

Trump's saying enough of the right things, and having enough success. Building the wall will be a modern political triumph. Just standing up to the media onslaught was a triumph. The right is intellectually indebted to Trump just like they're indebted to Milo.

Funny how it took those two to show the conservatives what it looks like to have guts.

I went from thinking of Romney has an upstanding guy who I disagreed with but who seemed nice, to someone I pretty much despise. The Israel shit is so typical.
What a cuck.
Only white people can be criticized -- any other race can do no wrong.  He is the definition of a cuckold -- laughing while another man fucks his wife.
Yep.  Sick of these traitors.
I really don't like people who present facts, because a lot of times, reality isn't real and the truth is a lie and if you think about it, what you feel is just as relevant as what you think. I mean, come on, people. 
If you look at history, an awful lot of Republicans supported Jim Crow and racist policies. But this is why you have to listen to Trump. History is often wrong. 
I DON'T LIKE NONVIOLENT, PEACEFUL PROTESTERS!!! 
who needs facts when you can get welfare and be a lazy piece of human garbage and have other people work like your mother taught you to do.
most people don't have the right to protest while doing their job. certainly not when their job is watched by millions of people. he can do as he wants, and so can we.
an awful lot more democrats supported jim crow laws and actually handled the legislation. But this is why you listen to democrats, you like being told what to think because you are incapable of independent thought. your comment history is hilarious proof of that. so sad :(
I agree entirely. HE shouldn't protest!!!11 I think he should do something about the problem instead of hiding in his safe space. Has he considered shooting unarmed civilians while doing his job!!?? That's what REAL AMERICAN HEROES DO EVERY DAY. 

Can I get an AMEN!?
no, no you cannot. real american heroes work for a living and use their free personal time to protest. you would know that if you worked for a living. 

cops that have been forced to shoot people do so because some human garbage don't know how to conduct themselves around the police. you would know that if you had an iq over 70 and didn't live on your knees like a dog.
When you have so many contradicting opinions so close together, on some many issues, you are bound to say something someone likes, at least some of the time. That is true. Time will tell what his actual opinions are on issues. 
MY DOG DOESN"T HAVE KNEES!!! A black person stole them. :(
i'm sure you find your racist humor amusing, folks on the left usually do.
Once again, the final line from House of Cards proves to be true.

He has a pretty good track record there. And here's the important part: when the media turned against him monstrously, early into his campaign, and cries came up from all sides to denounce him and demand that he apologize, he stood firm.

And that's why he's won, and why he drives so many people nuts.
*sigh*
Still waiting for a lib to explain to me how this is OK.
I prefer the Hoppe approach to such individuals. 
Is there really a good way to end that? Try it for anyone, you get much the same.

Which is it?
seriously? it's both. the proof is hilarious, and that is sad. 
Clinton use to not rent to black people, or put them all together. On applications from black people she would have her workers write a big "C" for "colored." Wait no, that was Trump.  
Yeah, but also, Trump's racist history doesn't help. Why do people need to talk about that? He has black friends and a black guy almost won his TV show. Some people have small minds. 
Isn't it kind of sad that you went looking through it? 
no, i don't think so. when i find i disagree with someone, i check out their history to try to understand the person's perspective before commenting and adjust my tone accordingly.
Well it seems like you set your tone on dick mode before, so I guess his history must really be "so sad."
that was my intent, so success!
What a poor attempt at an attack on Trumps character.
The woman telling other women to stay home by being outside the home. Irony and hypocrisy at it's finest.
Oh, I must be mistaken he didn;t apply for and receive a $150,000  for Small businesses to recover from 9/11.  Ooops..no wait..yes he did and he is a POS abusing money for really damaged people..

Day 2 of non-stop coverage of Hillary stumbling. WHY IS THE MEDIA SO TERRIBLE AT CENSORING THIS STORY?
90% of people may believe shocking headlines.  Adding "may" may reduce your accountability.  You may agree or disagree with me.  Someone may be jerking someone else's chain.

I hear you, but Clinton's actually putting a lot of effort into this.  The Washington Post just reported it on A3 -- for whatever it's worth.
Curious.  We are coming to a state where people think "if it works, it's okay", politically and financially.  Even if the consequences later are more corruption, distrust and degradation of the system.  

I think the sensationalist headlining trend we have is both muddying the waters excessively, and promoting extreme, rather than measured, opposition.  Why take the time to solve a problem properly when you can nuke it fast and hard?  Which leads to someone reacting to that over-reaction, again with an over-reaction.

Let's try to solve things better, not faster and easier.

Edited for clarity.

"Especially when Clinton is rumored to be..." Good journalism. Thanks OP.
It may just be a slow-motion collapse.  Trump just keeps gaining gradually.

Hell no! Not only what you said. But as a Trump guy and Republican i feel like we got her dialed in. Trump has started to make real effective and calculated attacks and is gaining serious ground. My worst fear is the Dems finding an excuse to replace her with someone competent.

 Boehner said said Biden was going to parachute in to the rescue months ago
I looked further into the polls.  Johnson does especially well with soldiers in the Navy and Marines.  He and Weld support global power projection with aircraft carriers and air strikes - just not invasions and occupations with ground forces.
Unfortunately, Johnson doesn't know where any of our enemies are.
&gt;Overall, then, Trump still has the advantage.  But how much of one compared to past elections remains unknown.

I think this could describe this whole election. With African Americans you can replace "Trump" with "Clinton" and the statement would be also true.

We won't know until November EXACTLY what is different about this election.
One term wonder who shat on Reagan's legacy not endorsing Trump? I'll bet that'll actually help Trump's poll numbers.
Bush camp is silent on the issue. This is only something a Kennedy claims he said. After what Trump did to his son clearly Bush is no fan of Trump  but this is just a silly story.
If this dont scream "salty" what does
A globalist wants another globalist in office.  shocking.  
Clinton has to fulfill Bush's dreams of a "New World Order".
I don't like Clinton, but I can't blame him for this.

This isn't helping or proving anything. It's a cherry picked statistic. Cops shouldn't be using lethal force in any situation unless shots have been fired or there is a clear and present danger in which disabling or non-lethal force will clearly not remove the danger.

You could say "7 [JEWISH] People Who The Nazis Didn't Put in Concentration Camps" and it wouldn't change the facts of the matter that it's happening.
That is the point of the article, it's mocking what the left has done to show how stupid it is to use these methods to push their agenda.

The article they are sharing around “Here Are 7 White People Who Pointed Guns at Cops and Didn’t Get Killed” aims prove that there is this huge problem of racist white cops going around killing black people, statistically this is not true and this article is pointless propaganda that proves nothing and only to creates racial divide.
Yes, yes you was compromised. Come down from the ledge lefty.
Bingo. Shootings occur often because of the intent of the suspect not just their behavior. The one instance in the article of an officer being shot at and not killing the suspect is very very rare.

Also firefox seems to render the word just fine, but if you type (or copy paste) it shows the squares of missing stuff
It's amazing that if you disagree with something in any conservative/republican subreddit that you're immediately labeled a liberal or lefty. This is why we can't get anything done in this country. No one is allowed to disagree.
It's one thing to disagree, it's another to disagree in an illogical and emotional manner. Do you understand?
Clinton upset that she's been beaten at this game.  She shouldn't had tried to shake him up by inviting Cuban.
You would think after all this, they would not try to out shitpost Donald Trump.

Say what you will about the guy, he is the master of this kind of stuff.
And then it comes out that they haven't invited her at all, and have gotten the media to report and remind everyone of who she is.  He just knows how to play them all.  It's his ace, and I'd like to think he has a chance the more it's successful.
How the fuck am I only now learning about [Gennifer Flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennifer_Flowers)? The POTUS has a 12-year long extramarital affair with a woman while he's married to Hillary, admits to it under oath, and the media barely mentions it? Meanwhile they call Trump a grand wizard of the KKK because of something someone said a friend told them Trump did 40 years ago? Da fuk?

&gt;Certain that there were plenty of people in the world who’d be interested in such a service — and willing to pay for it — Azad Chaiwala, a 33-year-old British entrepreneur of Pakistani origin, created what he said were the world’s first matchmaking sites for aspiring polygamists.

&gt;He started SecondWife.com, aimed specifically at Muslims, in late 2014, followed by Polygamy.com, which is open to anyone, this year.

She also did porn. Not saying there's necessarily anything wrong with that but people should know she's not the disadvantaged put-upon woman the way Hildog described her.
I feel that would be a huge mistake. 1st: Does anybody think Hillary's not prepared &amp; numb to events that are 25 years old. Plus, it opens the door for her to say, "We've had rocky times in our marriage, but we've always found a way to work it out and here we are, many years later, still married and stronger than ever. How many wives did you throw away when they showed signs of aging again, Mr. Trump?".

I don't know why Lester Holt grilled Trump on issues that were literally over 40 years old in 15 exclusive questions while the only exclusive question he asked Hillary was a softball sitting lightly on the tee.  That happened too.

What porn?

There is nothing except a clip from a reality TV show that showed grainy night-vision of two people in a bed. Trump should be able to tell you that reality TV is almost never real.

Find me a link to a real porn. Otherwise, stop peddling Trump's late-night ramblings as proof of anything.
Im fairly certain you get banned and the comment gets removed if you link porn to this sub. Look up Alicia machado poen. I know xviddo returns a decent number of hits

Edit: it appears the xvideo link is a hoax taken from another primo. So she never did hardcore porn, she just was in playboy and was in a shady reality tv show naked. So it depends what you consider porn
Wow! Seems like she really understands millenials and their goals. 

Heck as a millenial i just want to live the "American Dream". Own my own home (d, raise my family (my wife and daughter), and have a successful job (currently working for a major software company). 

Now as a millenial i did not want to do internships for free since I needed money to pay rent and other bills in order to support myself during college. I think that is the biggest reason why she doesnt understand us. 

Sorry for ranting.
&gt; That’s why it was easy to goad Trump into counter-attacking the Khans. That’s why it was easy to goad him into counter-attacking Miss Universe. But you know what no foreign leader will ever do to Trump? That sort of bullshit. That stuff only happens in campaigns and in our internal politics.

I have an honest question: How do people supporting traditional family values feel with the current state of the GOP.

Being a republican used to mean something. Values such as hard work, family, conservatism, responsibility, being a contributing member of society.

What the h*ll happened? 

And how do we get back to sanity?

I see it as a clear choice between words and deeds. Trump is a jerk who says things that offend people. He is also someone who has shown in his deeds a commitment to many, if not all, of the principles you mention.
He said something nasty about a woman in a private conversation. Um, yeah, him and literally every human being I have ever met has said something about someone else that they shouldn't have. His ended up on tape.
The funniest part about this is the entertainers like Miley Cyrus criticizing him. Are you kidding me? Look in a mirror, ladies.
He has worked hard AND contributed all his adult life. The bull hockey about taxes is an old liberal line of logic that conservatives should stamp out. Paying taxes is NOT how one "contributes" to the community. He has paid every penny of the taxes he has been required to pay by the tax code, and tried to avoid paying one penny more, which is EXACTLY what we all do.
In the mean time, his projects have undoubtedly contributed jobs (for workers who all pay taxes), he has consistently supported non-profit groups, and he has grown his personal wealth, which, again, is what we are all trying to do.
He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink or use drugs, and he has always acknowledged and supported his family. The worst we can say about his values by his actions is that he has been divorced several times. I have been divorced myself once, and don't feel like that made me a bad person. I wish my marriage had lasted the rest of my life, as we all believe on our wedding days. If I marry again it will be with the same hope, but it could work out badly again. People are complex and relationships are doubly so.
Trump has treated his children honorably, as you can see by their support of him. Deeds over words.

Let's contrast this with his opponent, Hillary Clinton. As Barack Obama correctly pointed out, she "will say anything" to get elected. She will always stick to the politically correct script in public and promise to look out for the oppressed. She will pander to any group that might help her win power. Then she -- as her past deeds show -- will do whatever it takes to gain more power and more money.
She says she wants to support women but she has attacked women whose only crimes were to be assaulted by her husband.
She said she wants peace but she deliberately destabilized sovereign nations so she and her cronies could profit.
She says she values hard work but she hasn't produced anything in her adult life. If you value conservative principles you MUST defeat Hillary because she sees those of us who know that wealth comes from production as evil. She wants to punish success with a 65% inheritance tax. But she says she loves the American way of life.
Clinton's deeds show a single-minded pursuit of power at any cost.

Trump's deeds show he is risking all the power he has to try to stop the decline of this country. All he had to do was be quiet and stay on the sidelines and he wouldn't be facing any of this shitstorm. He could almost certainly have made some private deals with Clinton to reap extraordinary benefits from her administration. But he is fighting.
He is fighting because someone has to.
Because Republicans haven't been.
Because we have put up McCain and Romney who would eat the liberal shit sandwich and smile and ask for more.
Maybe Ted Cruz would have fought better. It doesn't matter now. Trump is the candidate we have. He is the candidate who showed the guts to fight. Guys who have the guts to fight aren't always nice guys. More often they have flaws. But someone has to fight for what is right. And we all better hope and pray that he wins, because every time we help those bastards defeat our own fighters, we push ourselves closer to oblivion. 

Tl;dr: Don't buy the bullshit about what he has said; look at what he has done and is doing.
&gt; Don't buy the bullshit about what he has said; look at what he has done and is doing.

I'm seeing he is so far away from true Family Values he couldn't reach it by walking for a month.

He cheated on his wives (plural), committed sexual assault (by his own admission), refers to his daughter in sexualized language (which I rather not repeat). He is sometimes [pro-abortion](http://www.refinery29.com/2016/08/120694/is-donald-trump-pro-life-abortion-stance) and [pro gay rights](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/trump-gay-rights-immigration-test-speech).

What else do you need to show this is not a real republican.

I get the dislike for Hillary - I really do. But that does not make Trump a reasonable candidate.

It may be the case that one votes only for House/Senate, and vote for a 3rd party candidate for president.

And what amazes me is that the Republican leadership seems to prefer a non-republican under the republican flag, rather than admit the truth - we messed up with the choice of candidate. We messed up badly.
Imagine, if you will, the reaction from the Heartland of America if a Democratic politician of color had come onto a stage with his five children from three different wives and who was secretive about his finances and ties to Russia and was caught on camera talking about grabbing women’s crotches while boasting of his draft-dodging and tax avoidance.
I think our hatred of the Clintons has driven us mad. 

Sure - they are not my favorite kind of people, but to end up with President Trump ?! That's not completely sane.
This is exactly what I am talking about. He didn't sexually assault anyone. He said something crass. You don't think if he had actually done that that the victim would have been found and paraded out by the left?
I personally don't care about his stance on abortion or gay marriage because those are both settled law. I am far more concerned about having a president who will at least have the guts to tell the truth about Clinton and all of the DC shills.

But it doesn't make any difference whether you like Trump or not. He IS the nominee. If you care about any of the principles you mention you MUST support him. He is the only candidate who will do anything to stem the tide of liberal strength and conservative weakness. A vote for Gary Johnson or a write-in for Ted Cruz is a vote for Hillary.

I no longer go to church, but was raised in it. I remember very clearly those people who Jesus Christ called out and chastised most strongly: hypocrites!
Let him among you who is without sin cast the first stone.
I never heard Joe Paterno say a single crass thing in decades of coaching. If Jerry Sandusky hadn't been on his staff, he could have been nominated for sainthood in Pa. Behind closed doors that man helped a child molester abuse children for years. I wouldn't spit on Joe Paterno if he were still alive and on fire. I have had enough of people who, like the Pharisees, publicly demonstrate their goodness, and secretly commit every evil under the sun. 
&gt; He didn't sexually assault anyone

He said he did/does. Didn't you hear him?

&gt; If you care about any of the principles you mention you MUST support him

No I don't. I can (and should) vote my conscience - 3rd party, or not vote for president at all. I am certainly not convinced Trump is any better than Clinton. Sure she lies - she is a politician. But Trump is unstable, impulsive, doesn't do his homework on the issues. I don't want to give that much power to a person I don't consider a responsible adult. Clinton will be more-of-the-same-crap. Trump can me much much worse crap.

&gt; I remember very clearly those people who Jesus Christ called out

Mathew 19:24 "Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

It seems the current Republican party loves money and billionaires so much it forgot to read the Bible. Really really sad.

Lt. Ian McConnaughey, a Navy spokesman, said Monday it's unclear if the Mason was specifically targeted, though the missiles were fired in its direction."

Monumental disaster.
Interesting article. I wonder whether the scope of these deductions would include a re-fi. If that were the case, it's arguable for someone with vast resources to claim a deduction of large sums, which is likely to undermine the original intent of this case. That said, I'm incredibly intrigued and do concede that this method would behoove many homeowners across the US. 
But then Republican leaders immediately regretted overriding it.  The immediate and long-term implications of this bill are disastrous. 
So, what are the odds Trump starts a new political party the day after the election, win or lose?
If there's a way for him to raise Other People's Money, he'll do it.
There are 10s of people there!
The Republican party was on the verge of a Trump victory, and gaining the ability to reverse many of the Democrat favoring, engineered demographic shifts. Over just 4 years of Trump, Republicans could have shifted the power dynamic so much that the GOP would have been essentially the only party. 


Trump still has a great chance at victory and the Republican party still has a chance to take a solid grasp on the coming decades of electoral politics. I'm surprised these loser cuck Republicans don't want to be apart of that bright future.

Fox could run with new bias and corruption every day. They are in the MSM.
Who in the fuck do you think you are? Democrats just got outed as corrupt on the highest levels and you're worrying about how someone looks?
Takes one to know one
But voter ID is racist. Give me a fucking break.
OK, we knew that, or at least HIGHLY suspected...but, like Comey @ FBI and x IRS chief and Hillbag &gt;&gt;&gt; lies, fraud, maybe murder...all go unpunished...all go uninvestigated. now what honest Americans?  what do do?
I've been following the leaked emails for a while and its very surprising of how much people do not really know about them. Major news outlets do not run stories on them. I think if more people knew about them then this election would be even more interesting with all the crazy scandals. 
You know, an upside to this whole Trump thing is he's really revealed how totally insane Giuliani is. 
Yes, that moment when he threw the American democratic system in the trash was yuge.
Member when Gore said the same thing...I member.
Precisely where it belongs until there's strict photo ID requirements across the board.
Thank you for revealing the views of a true Trump supporter.
You do? When, weeks before the election, Al Gore said that he might or might not accept the result? Or, again, before the election, that it was rigged? No, I don't. Could you share it with us? Thanks.
Not at all.  This is like asking a football coach before a game if they are going to challenge any calls using their Instant Replay flag.  I viewed this as simply him saying he couldn't rule out any challenges to the results until the actual election and finding out if any fraud was reported/documented.
nope, glad he told us he won't give up just like that if they try to steal it
What on earth are you talking about, who try to steal what, and why would Democrats even try to that, since Clinton is clearly winning?
Actually no, it's like announcing in advance that if the other team wins the game, you won't accept that victory. Because elections don't have an instant replay flag.
I guess you forgot the multiple suits Gore took to the supreme court in 2000? Or are you actually just 12?
No, not familiar with that. I only know about *Bush v. Gore,* which obviously was filed by BUSH, and the automatic recount due to the election being a tie, despite Gore having won the popular vote. Al Gore, being a Democrat and a patriot, of course accepted the Supreme Court's ruling, despite its controversial position, even, in his role as president of the Senate, ruling any challenge  out of order. What are you referring to?
How big of a task is it to identify yourself?
I love this revisionist history.  Democrats have perfected the art of voter fraud and have been using it for 100 years to steal elections.  Go back and look at some of the great "political machines" of the past.  In my home (Kansas City MO), in the 1930’s, the Democrats would have the police department round up homeless people on election day.  They would then drive them to different polling places and after they voted "Democrat", they would pay them with beer.

You got videos that just came out of Democrat operatives talking on camera about bussing illegals to swing states to vote.  Do liberals ever actually read anything for themselves, or only repeat what they have been told they are allow to think.

Yes, when the vote is so close the outcome is in doubt--to continue our analogy, that would be like overtime. So again, not at all the same thing.
So I take it you have absolutely no evidence of any substantial voter fraud within say, this century? YOu have a video of Democratic operatives talking about helping undocumented immigrants vote?! Wow, where is it?
Depends on the individual, and how hard it is in that state. I work for a program that helps people get state IDs. Sometimes it's not too hard and just costs a few dollars, and sometimes it's very hard. But I'm fine with where you're at in this conversation. Your view is that our current democratic system belongs in the trash. I get it. Do you think a lot of Republicans ~~are anti-American, like you~~ feel this way?
[deleted]
You don't, nor do you need to. If the vote is too close, then by law there is a recount, only after which is there an outcome to the election. And any decent citizen needs to accept that outcome, whether before or after a recount, if any. To do otherwise is to reveal a lack of support for the democratic process.

btw, has Trump said anything about close votes, or recounts?

Yeah, I'm sure if a journalist uncovered evidence of [GOP operatives bragging about how to commit voter fraud](http://www.npr.org/2016/10/19/498587397/sting-video-purports-to-show-democrats-describing-how-to-commit-voter-fraud), you'd just ignore it and accept the results?

There's a reason why the dead tend to vote Democrat.
If Clinton is clearly winning, then why are you so concerned about accusations of voter fraud?

I know it can't be because you're worried about violence. Whenever BLM starts riots after shootings, no one on the left complains when they burn down buildings or shoot cops. So it must be something else...perhaps it's guilt for a woman you know is terribly corrupt and dishonest?
Bush brought suit against Gore to stop him from illegally requesting manual recounts in counties that Gore had won, while ingoring counties that Bush had won. SCOTUS agreed. Gore didn't care about a fair election. He was just trying to squeeze out more votes from solid Democrat counties.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore#Background
I thought you were claiming that Al Gore brought multiple suits to the Supreme Court in 2000. Are you withdrawing that claim, now that you realize it's false, before you go on to make other false accusations? 
&gt; If Clinton is clearly winning, then why are you so concerned about accusations of voter fraud?

Maybe if you think really hard you can understand why I might be concerned about a Republican candidate who undermines faith in our democracy itself?

Are you now trying to claim that Hillary Clinton is not clearly ahead in the polls lol?

Excellent!
literally **ALL** the lame stream media are packing the polls pro Criminal Hillbag so we really can't trust anybody.  here on the ground, the vibes are all Trump with **almost zero** Hillbag lawn signs, T-shirts etc.

my theory is this:  if the lame stream media says it's close...that means Trump is ahead.  in my heart, I see a Trump landslide :-)
I'm hoping for change
2. An MSNBC producer called Hillary an "amazing, intelligent woman."

Talk about a smoking gun! 
Al Gore appealed to the Supreme Court? That's shocking. Oh wait that was George Bush. Hence the name of the case, *Bush v Gore.*
[deleted]
A lot of people are following Trump because he says what a lot of people would consider common sense talking points.  If The GOP wants to become relevant again they should take some of the things Trump is saying is wrong, and put a conservative solution to it.  At the moment all people are seeing from the GOP are some of the same old politicians, preaching the same thing that got us where we are right now.
of course she was.  she's legally impregnable.  you know, **Democrat !!!**

lie to Congress?  no problem?  kill innocent government workers?  no problem?  ruin lives with lies?  no problem.  recklessly expose secret national data?  no problem.  stuff her bank account with illegal donations?  no problem
So Trump surrogate Brietbart hires some and Clinton hires some. It's all super sketchy and questionable. 
&gt; To save their party from Trumpism, Republicans need to...

absurd.  party needs to be saved from hypocrisy and establishment voting

I got an email this morning from Hypocrite-in-Chief Paul Ryan talking about being a conservative...that's the kind of trash lie I'm talking about
My favorite part is how Rubio warned the GOP to be careful or Wikileaks's may expose them next.  If the GOP gets exposed, good. I'm more upset now than ever before that I voted Rubio in the primary.
I did mail voting last week and voted for every race except Senate.  I could not bring myself to vote for Rubio or the Dem.  Rubio is a traitor/liar like all the rest.  let the other people of Florida decide

If there's one thing that I've learned this election cycle, it's that there are Republicans, and there are conservatives.

It's disgusting that so many people, supposedly Republican, put more faith in Hillary than Trump. Do you have no conviction? Do you not actually care for the future of this country? Get out and vote Trump. It's the only way to beat the establishment and return law and order.

And quit saying Hillary is going to win. You're just discouraging voters. The polls are rigged, we all know that. Get out and vote and we can easily put Hillary away.
Yeah, because we know that massive voter fraud is occurring. Dead people aren't voting for Trump.
What a bunch of unBASED pathetic beta cucktarded shitlibs 
Voter fraud is mostly committed by blacks and other coloreds the polls prove it study it before you talk next time please

there's no escape.  the libtards control local papers too.  the local free rag here even has climate change disaster "news".  academia is where they breed these progressives.  so-called elite academia is where they breed the media you commonly see nationwide

&gt; Today I put Trump’s odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%. Remember, I told you a few weeks ago that Trump couldn’t win unless “something changed.”

Kim Jong Il also shot 11 hole-in-ones on his first golf outing.
Hannity makes me nervous when he runs down the scenarios and almost all end up +Hillary
Click bait title and no real content other than people agreeing with him. There I saved you a click.
Seems pretty rigged to always pick Hillary. Not that I'm surprised, but still.
What a shitty website. Trump should shut these rags when he's president
Typical buzzfeed trash. 
Just like all the other times these get posted. Usually placeholders or they already have both articles written and accidentally published one. This isn't a thing that needs to be an issue for anyone. 
Lets simply see how many people will sue for electoral fraud once the numbers of votes start matching actual votes. 

And how likely an accusation of electoral fraud will be taken. 
It was an AP system test to make sure the check mark would appear next to the bigger number... I'd be very shocked if these numbers match on Tuesday. 
seems to me like someone was testing/debugging their website and missed resetting a few test variables or something 
Whenever I try to consider the liberal side, this shit happens and I feel like I just need to vote against whoever they want me to vote for.
I'm not gonna tell you who to vote for but you're delusional if you don't think the Fox  News does this too
At this point, i don't care if fox does it.  CNN has turned into a shit show of "Trump has no chance guys!" And fox has been the only network to remotely report him honestly
there is zero excuse for all intelligent Americans to not completely disregard all things all media says

you must go through the effort of reviewing multiple sources for everything then making a personal decision as to truth
I watched both this morning.

CNN: Hillary will win.

Fox: Trump will win.

There was no balanced reporting from either side.
Wish there was someone I felt have both sides an honest platform. Only thing I found is the Rubin Report on YouTube.

Also Steven Crowder is conservative but honest.

[This came to mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmErRm-vApI)
Both parties had populist uprisings.  The GOP grudgingly accepted theirs and the DNC fought it every step of the way.  

I do hope the GOP learned something from this.  On Monday, all I heard from the party elites is that "he has no ground game" and "he didn't spend enough money on ads" and "he's going to hurt the down ticket republicans."


I doubt Trump personally cares for the little people, given his past business practices.
There was a similar reaction by Republicans when Obama won.
The next four years are going to be hilarious.
By "little guy", you surely cannot be referring to little Muslim, gay, black, or Latino guys, since Trump made it pretty clear how he feels about those little guys 
Give me a break. Trump *is* part of the ruling class elite. That is, part of the bourgeois donor class elite who help fund the campaigns of the bureaucratic elite who control state offices. The only difference this time is they've dropped all pretense of propriety, skipped right over the middle man and elected someone from the donor class to the head of state. Who needs expensive puppet politicians when you can have a capitalist CEO directly control the monopoly on violence?
I'm sure the coal miners Trump supported will be happy to hear when the Republican Congress and House vote to ensure every coal miner get's more work to do.  Joking here of course.  I don't think Republicans viewed the "little guy" ever more then someone who needs to be paid the lowest amount of wages so that the bosses can keep all the money.   This will be a rude awakening for the "little guys".
Can someone explain to me what happened? Seems like many Republicans don't like him so... who the hell voted for him?
I am highly disappointed by the content and tone of others replying herein today
how stupid.  regulation was on the list, but down down about 20th
Middle class America and the white woman.  Which I believe is was the target.  His whole message resonates with the middle class working family.

Or at least that's how I looked at it.


No, it really isn't. This is one of the things we need to know about BEFORE President Trump takes office, so we can take an objective measure of his performance.

But the swamp is full of Republicans now.  
  
Something tells me there won't be much draining going on.
Hah, just watch and see. 
my first thought is who exactly will be briefing?  

it's no secret Obama skips many briefings and what he wants to know/hear likely are radically different from what a real constitutional president needs/demands

you all agree?
Given his past behavior as a businessman, probably not what he promised during his campaign.  Seriously: Obama made a lot of rosy promises that he didn't keep, and Obama is a nice guy on a personal level.  He never got cheating on his wife like Clinton, for one.  Trump, by contrast, is a self-centered pathological liar.  We can't expect him to keep *any* of his promises.

Awesome evidence bro

Unsubstantiated claims do nothing for our cause but make us look like conspiracy theorists. Source your shit. 
 If conservatives do not fight for solutions to environmental issues, liberals will. The resulting policies will be both bad for both the environment and the economy. Instead, we should take the lead on environmental policy and show that the free market is a better solution than government regulation.
Polls are inherently flawed.  For instance, Internet polls aren't going to hit a lot of senior citizens (I hear Trump himself doesn't use a computer), so it will be skewed towards the young who tend to be more left-wing.
Obama should just step down now, the sooner the MAGA the better!
Cuck

Hmmm.  How good is Trump at keeping his contracts?
I don't know how the free market can deal with climate change.  If you are pursuing environmentally-friendly business practices but your competitor isn't, that puts you at a disadvantage, so why would you if the government doesn't force you to?
Yup. Let Obama follow ex-PM Cameron
His election had nothing to do with race or sex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkx4gGfmUVs
It definitely had some to do with all the racism towards white people lately, you're right.

What I meant to say is Trump didn't win because his voters all hate minorities.
maybe.  or was it the same cheatin' left wing lame stream media polls that showed Hillbag ahead, essentially 4-10 points?  why not also lie about Obama's approval?

Second paragraph: "But none of these positive reforms can be accomplished without Obamacare repeal. On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare."

Literally nothing wrong with him mildly changing his stance, it happens to nearly all Presidents. Just wish Breitbart wouldn't lie about it.
I think it's clearly to do with race on another level; say White people were 40% of the population (which is predicted to happen in a few decades) Trump would have lost.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but one of the reasons premium prices are spiking is due to the fact insurers can't deny you for preexisting conditions. And he wants to leave that in.
You're totally right. I'm just saying that he absolutely wanted to repeal Obamacare because it was a "total disaster." Now he's keeping the good parts. Liberals are making this a huge deal and it doesn't help when Breitbart misleads them
This article is a worthless. The writer presumes that Trump is going to listen to his think tank's ideas like Reagan didn and live up to the promises of his campaign.  Trump is a pathological liar.  Obama failed to keep many of his promises, but on a personal level he is a nice guy, so how can we expect better from Trump?
I know that part of his plan is to open state borders so that insurance companies have to compete with one another, driving costs down. Not sure how effective that would be, but that's his plan
If I'm not mistaken, another reason insurance was more costly for some was because of the elevated baseline insurance coverage. I think I remember people discussing how it was unnecessary for an elderly couple to have to get prenatal care and birth control coverage. 
I could see him technically a mending it but still having the same effect as repeal and replace.If done right In the end it's just a technicality and it could help win over Dems since it would be less destructive to the Obama legacy. 
&gt; is now faced with someone who they think is racist, sexist, and xenophobic

no they don't.  that slander is just Progressive Playbook Chapter 4 stuff

it works to distort minds and mislead, but the upper libtards don't believe that tripe
That makes no sense. The free market is geared towards profit, profit and environmental safety are not one and the same, they can be in some cases. But if it's cheaper to dump untreated water in to municipal waters then why would the free market adjust without government regulation? There is zero incentive, especially with public company CEOs worried about short term growth, again, because the free market forces them to.
Who knew that ignoring and being condescending to 40% of the country's population for decades would result in losing a presidential election?
The government would tax the dumping of untreated water because that creates a negative externality on the economy. Since there is no longer an economic incentive to pollute the market will begin to favor producers who can minimize or eliminate pollution. 
So the free market needs government regulation is what you're saying.
They still don't get it, they're saying Trump needs to make apologies for offending them and he needs to reach out to work with them.

No dumbasses, you just got the shit kicked out of you because of your ideology and condescending bullshit.  Kiss our ass you whiney blowhards.
He walked back on his notion that Obama was born in Kenya.  He pushed that conspiracy theory well beyond the point of political expedience, then he rejected the notion all of a sudden as if he was doing Obama a favor by shutting it down once and for all.

Trump says something one day and something else the other.  Even if he was sincere when he said those things, he obviously feels no sense of commitment to what he says.

That all you got?
This blog post appears to be out of date. The page it links to shows Hillary's ahead by about 700k votes.
Racism isn't a political ideology, and people on the left like to paint it as something synonymous only with conservative ideology
 Both sides certainly have skeletons in their closets when it comes to the past of their party. However, past affairs and current affairs are strikingly different. There are several very qualified people for this position, and it saddens me to hear he got the position, especially if the country is to move forward. 
But, he is an outsider and not a career politician like Robert Byrd. 
This isn't helpful.

Steve Bannon is alive and on his way to the White House. I don't know that he's a white supremacist but I do know that he's made a career out of falsehoods and bigotry.

Robert Byrd died in 2010 and was honored by the NAACP for reforming his racism before his death. He supported the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.

Maybe if Byrd were alive, or headed to the White House, or if Bannon had repeatedly repented for his sins - this would be comparable.

Get this shit out of here and let's stop being the post-fact party.
Heritage Foundation showing their concern that Trump won't listen to them.
He's not a white supremacist. This whole thing is more absurd leftist buzzword play. Instead of seeing that this backfired on them in the election, they doubled down on the strategy.

It didn't work then and it won't work now. 

Bannon is the man for the job at this time. That's all there is to it.  Honestly, I wish Trump would have passed on Reinse and taken Bannon for COS. 
&gt;This whole thing is more absurd leftist buzzword play.

This is why you people didn't see the trump victory. 
I'm really excited to see what Trump can do. 

That said, Stephen Bannon *might* not be a bad guy, but he's not balanced and impartial. We need leaders that can unite,  not attack dogs. 
Is it assassination if he does it to himself?
This still doesn't negate the argument about how stupid the Electoral Collage system is.
&gt; But that’s the wonderful thing about being a narcissist like Obama. If something wonderful happens, it’s solely due to you – just look at Obama’s self-glorifying announcement of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. If something terrible happens, it’s not your fault – it’s everybody else’s fault.

This is actually psychopathy.  Narcissists can experience remorse.
I've heard a lot of bad talk about this guy long before Trump picked him.
Republicans never stopped whining all throughout Obama's administration so Democrats are going to return the favor.
every president is 100% entitled to whatever/whomever staff he pleases...period
&gt; he's not balanced and impartial. 

YAHOO !!!  Great !!! Wonderful !!!

I want ZERO fair and balanced...**Z E R O**
Take your meds and calm down. We need people that can unite this country and drain the swamp... and Stephen Bannon won't. I'm very right leaning but feel dirty going to Breitbart for news. It's the same drivel as CNN just on the opposite end of the spectrum.

Bannon, and Trump, still have to deal with Congress on most issues. If Congress is united in stopping an extreme guy like Bannon, then watch those 4 years evaporate without getting anything done. If the GOP lose in the mid term elections, then Trump has 2 years to get anything done.
He doesn't need to pick these extreme guys in his cabinet. The GOP will be a road block, and naturally so will the Dems, and don't just laugh that off as trivial. Trump should be picking guys that can actually move policy forward, not cause divides.

If you block transports &amp; ruin the fay of regular people going about their own thing, you deserve punishment  

There are many legal ways to protest, but they choose to vandalize &amp; block roads.
I don't think protesters should be arrested for peaceful protest, however the meaning of "protest" seems to have recently overlapped with rioting, vandalism, and instigating (such as blocking traffic). So, I don't really blame people for wanting to stifle this sort of "protest", if they didn't essentially riot and disrupt roadways, then people wouldn't be so upset. 
These things sound like arrestable offenses. At the risk of asking a stupid question, is there a legal reason police couldn't just scoop up rioters, vandals, or instigators (blocking traffic)?

I live in Portland and I don't like the riots that have taken place, but I'm not in a hurry to sign away my right to protest (in a non-asshole way).
&gt;vandalize &amp; block roads.

Which are already unlawful. No new laws needed.
And yet very few arrests, and very few actual convictions from those arrests. When police feel like they're on a leash with dealing with this rioters because they're afraid they will been spun in a negative light, it's hard to even enforce current law.
How many of those "protestors" blocked roads that led to Trump rallies yet none have beem arrested. How many of the hundreds who rioted in the streets in front the GOP convention were arrested? 5? 16?  

We need a clearer, stricter law that will get at least half of those illegals &amp; little sissies in jail &amp; fined! 
It's a toss-up between *uneducated* and *racist*.

wonderful piece.  very well written / dead on point
This is insane.  I am so confused.  So I should not learn science, math, etc...?  I should only work at McDonald's to make sure everyone gets their breakfast?  This piece makes it sound like being ignorant is good.  Does the writer of this piece know that Donald Trump is 'educated'?  Is the writer 'educated'?  I'm pretty conservative with regards to government in my bedroom, in my money, in my life, liberties taken, etc.  but telling people not to get a decent education is bewildering to me.  What is going on here?  I am super glad I have an education and knowledge on how to not only use my hands but my head.  I don't need the architect to tell me how to build it.   I can do both.  That is something to strive for.  This piece is scary.  Who tells people not to get educated?  I learn everyday.  I work everyday and there is always a learning curve.  I don't think I like the opinion article guy.  He makes it sound like my children would be better off in the coal mine than running the business.  Someone explain.  I must be missing something.  Education is not liberal nor conservative, it's just smart to learn and grow.

Yeah, I didn't understand this. The scientists I could understand, but giving medals to actors and athletes? I like entertainment as much as the next guy, but these people aren't exactly changing the world.
From 63-93, there were only 9 individuals to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom for 'sports.' Then GWB came along and handed out 8 during his tenure, half to baseball players. Obama has now awarded 11 in the category, 5 to basketball players.

It's best not to think too hard about this medal.
also sad is that an uber FAR FAR left progressive like Hanks actually believes he deserves / has rightfully won the award...  geez, what a jerkwad.  look at that face...geez
More and more scientists and cops agree that law enforcement cannot stop drug abuse.  It should be treated as a medical issue.
Kennedy changed the original presidential order to include the following "cultural or other significant public or private endeavors." I think we can consider movie actors as cultural. I might not agree with TH political views, but he definitely is an outstanding actor 
It now also includes showing up to a worksite, armed, and destroying the place and stealing cars.

And the massive number of baby boomers reaching old age

The leaked reddit admin slack chat confirming he did indeed modify posts and the admins want to shutdown the_donald http://archive.is/ZmULb
[removed]
No, he shouldn't.

He edited comments. He compromised the integrity of his entire website. Reddit will never be the same. If he can do this anonymously without notifying anyone, how many has he done it with before? It's also illegal as he changed someone's words without permission
I appreciate you straightforwardness. After using this website for a little over four years, I've come to the conclusion that I do not take this site seriously, I use it to vent sometimes, congratulate sometimes, post an opinion for what it's worth to whomever will listen and then log off and go start life. My integrity in life is so much more important than anything that could ever happen on this comedic site. Always remember, if a mod can ban you for what you say, and I have been banned a few times, what's the difference? Someone changes your words, or someone stifles you altogether for posing a different opinion that doesn't agree with theirs? It's Reddit, meh. Peace to you and yours.
Reddit owns the posts, unsure about  intellectual property but they can ABSOLUTELY modify whatever they see fit legally. Don't make bullshit up. Is it a terrible terrible move and telling of the future and suspicious of the past? Yes. Illegal? Fuck no.
If they own the posts it's fine. Kind of a Reddit noob so I didn't know they owned the posts
Illegal or not the man should step down.  Especially if Reddit intends to maintain a popular belief that they are a collection of free thinking users collaborating on topics.  Your initial response of "Shuuuut Uppppp" is very Wizard of Oz like "don't pay any attention to the man behind the curtain".  People always tell the few conservatives on this site to shut up about the site being biased against them, and now they have it from the horses mouth, and your first response is to tell everyone to shut up and ignore what was said and done.
Reddit is a toxic pit.  The few "actual" free thinkers, and conservatives on here have been saying it for years.  Now they have admitted the things they've been accused of, and the majority are instead of seeing the seriousness of what happened, telling you to shut up and get over yourself.
I think James is right. Everyone needs to calm down and remember a few things, namely that reddit is a business and not a democracy and that free speech only prevents government censorship. 
And as an aside I find how much this controversy is being editorializing, especially consider how much certain parts of railed against media bias for the past year. "Reddit CEO censors  Trump supporters critical of him" sounds way worse than "Reddit CEO reacts when Washington Post article links to comment section of reddit wherein users make baseless accusations of pedophilia by editing said comments: does this in order to protect the public perception, and therefore shareholder investments, of company he is charged with managing."
No doubt it was done in the "best interests" of Reddit, and I'm sure they only were poking back at some of these crazy users.  Unfortunately it is a very fine line they are trying to walk along, and these actions, regardless of how innocent they're really were, does not set a very good precedent going forward.  I really do feel the best move going forward may be to better define the rules regarding "baseless accusations" in order to better protect the integrity of the site and its users, and then for him to step down into a slightly smaller position.

If they gave him access to change user messages then it likely means he has access to user data which is a big no no.

Acknowledge me, Donald-San. 
I feel the same. A university education can be whatever you make it. However most of all it exposes you to a way of thinking that encourages lifelong learning and an appreciation for the process. It is humbling. While I have no statistics, I would believe that more people regret not going to college than regret doing so. There has been alot of knowledge compiled in the last few hundred years and universities help to sort it all out. I do wish that self-study could get you further in life and that credentials for expertise didn't cost hundreds of thousands. 
Learning can only occur through experience. If one does not go experience, whether it's reading a book or talking to someone with a different viewpoint, then they won't ever learn anything new. University is just one way of organizing experiences to gain important knowledge. There are others but the work:societal gain is not worth it.
I find that the most intelligent people I know are the most comfortable admitting their ignorance. 
Is there any evidence to support the claim that rape is more prevalent in areas that support higher populations of illegal immigrants? Or that potential rapists could be found through a vetting process? I support impeding the drug cartels, but I doubt that people cross the border specifically to go do rape in a new place. So we need to evaluate if the rapists are the problem, or if incidentally the drug movers have poor morals and happen to also sometimes be rapists.

except he didn't really tweet this... it's a fake picture... would be a good gesture though
He can pay the government for the costs. Just send a check to the IRS.
Yup...not a legit tweet.  Thanks for the heads up.
This is fake. I wish people invested 30 seconds to check Twitter if it was real or not before taking an image - not a link to a *recent Tweet* - as gospel.

Ahh Trump being the Internet troll he is.    By stating that the popular vote is "rigged" because of the "millions of votes from illegitimate voters" completely disqualifies you from saying the recount is a scam.  Recounts are good, they essentially audit the process post-mortem.  

It is good to audit a system - to test it.  Whether or not the results change, it is good to have confidence in the system.

It's funded at no cost to the tax payer.

It most likely will not change the results.

However, it establishes credibility in the system and process.  Jill Stein is a patriot for doing so.  Having a credible system is that important.


I partially agree.  Having an education either formal (university educated) or via life experience is necessary to keep moving along.  Being a rust belt worker that has been looking for a government program to pull them up by their bootstraps is NOT what we need.  No one pulls you up - you pull yourself up.

Having a formal university education is absolutely needed for many occupation: medicine, legal, engineering, finance/economics, and so on.  Can you imagine Intel hiring people without a EE degree?   What.. they learn on the job.  Give me a f'ing break.

If the author is saying there are diploma mills like ITT - I agree.  If you are the type that want to get a degree just for the money and a job, but don't have the passion - I personally will detect that during an interview and not hire you anyways.   This is especially true in the engineering field - why would you pay $100K+ for a EE degree and not be passionate and a geek on technology?


I kind of thought it was a basic value that customers could choose where they want to shop for any or no reason at all? The free market decided that his actions caused a downturn in business. Does he want us to prop up his establishment with some kind of subsidy just because he happens to be in the minority in that city? If someone could help me understand what's going on, I would appreciate it :) thanks!
This is true.  A lot of people had really bad insurance with high deductibles and low caps.  They basically took a page out of car insurance and stated what the baseline is, like you said.
That is the most popular provision of Obamacare, but also the most expensive.  It'll be interesting to see how he works around it.  No excuses now, it's the Republican's show.

China's excesses in the South China Sea are going to lead to a giant war if we don't curtail them soon. We needs to repair our relationships with all the archipelago nations in the area, and Taiwan to insure friendly ports of call for supplies and repairs.

some sort of "you can't do that" backlash complaint to once again undo a liberal policy/posture...undo by simply taking a phone call?   geez, they're (media, liberals, both sides of the political establishment) TERRIFIED and Trump hasn't even been sworn in yet.  these are going to be a sensational 4 yaers

I don't remember any of my democrat friends asking me to cut ties or give up belongings. And what leader do democrats follow? The party is totally lacking leadership. If anything, these characteristics are more closely tied with conservatives, especially Christian conservatives.

Oh.  I know quite a few and have never seen nor heard them act this way.  Must be the Reddit hive mind at work.  I know t_D is a lot like this.  I guess it's both sides when they are in the extreme.  I know I am independent but that subreddit over any other is full blown cult worship in action.  I haven't really been to any dem subreddits so that's the only one I have to compare with.  And Satanism?  Really.  I mean Really?  That makes me feel all giggly inside.  Most of the dems I know are Christians.  Have yet to meet one that worships Satan but I will come back and update the minute I do.  All parties and people want money.  That is not dem nor republican.  Donald is not poor if you haven't noticed.  Neither are any of his staff choices.  Hillary isn't poor either but not in the same class of wealth that Donald has.  Anyways not arguing just pointing out the inaccuracies of that blanket statement and you using DEM's.  Big accusations you are using for a party I have never seen do any of these things and I follow both parties pretty closely.  Independent allows me the freedom to fully evaluate with out being one sided and having a me vs. them mentality so I must look at it differently than someone caught in the cult mind.  You singled out Dem's, meaning you are in the republican cult.  You vs. them.  How nice not have that mind set.  Anyways, I got to rambling on pointing out that you are acting quite cultish yourself with that blanket statement.  us vs. them.  I'm American and I have am so glad I have never felt that way towards my fellow Americans.  Free of the cult. 
I don't think you know what anarchy is. And the article says that the cultists are blindly devoted to a leader. How can people be blindly devoted to a leader they don't believe in or know exists?

People seriously need to get their heads out of their asses and start understanding that we are all just people with differing opinions and ways of life. I swear to god you are fed this bullshit and you eat it up so much that it becomes your religion. 
They have daddy issues. 
My brother works for the oil industry.

One time, he explained Saudi Arabia to me this way.

Imagine aliens landed on earth and said, "Hey, you guys have stuff under your feet that we'd like to have. Here's some warp-capable spacecraft and some other stuff that we don't really need. We'll give it to you if you let us take it from you. You won't even know we're here since we'll be out in the middle of nowhere."

Saudi Arabia is not what you think it is. Do you think Americans care who owns the oil field? Do you think Americans are writing a big huge fat check to the Saudis? Most of the money coming out of the ground in Saudi Arabia ends up in America. The oil is worked by Americans for Americans. If there are Saudis in the business, they are either there as manual labor or as a token leader.

China is like Saudi Arabia but they have people, not oil. Us sending our money over there to put Chinese people to work building iPhones and junk for us makes us a bunch of money. The Chinese are not in control. What are they going to do, tell us to build those iPhones in Oklahoma? We've poured a lot of money into their economy, for sure, but it pales in comparison to what we have been getting out of it. After all, investors are not stupid. They do not throw good money after bad.

If the Chinese have fancy buildings and German cars and drink expensive wine and wear nice clothing, who cares? Those are the trappings of wealth, but not wealth itself. Or do you think there are Chinese billionaires who know how to take billions of dollars and turn it into trillions?

The bottom line with trade is this: The country with the free-er trade wins all the time. We used to think mercantilism was the way to go, but Americans discovered long before the revolution that there was a lot more money to be made doing the exact opposite.

If you're one of those that are concerned with how money flows in the world, let me assuage your doubts and fears with this.

China sends us the product of their labor.

We send them little bits of paper with green ink.

That should help you sleep better at night. After all, we have their junk, but all they have is paper. When they get sick of this arrangement, we'll have to find some other country willing to send us junk for little bits of paper. But we have a lot of trees and a lot of ink and the willingness to use them to make people send us more junk.

What should scare you is if the Chinese try to balance trade by importing stuff from the US. That would mean they don't believe the bits of paper are valuable anymore. It would mean they're calling our bluff.
That's obviously untrue.

Since 1985 when America began trading with China, America's economy has grown by a multiple of 4.  China's by 64.

China's economy is now bigger than America's.

There's a difference between extracting raw materials (from Arabia), and offshoring advanced industries with increasing returns (to China).  Arabia depends upon America.  China doesn't.

That's because we've created China in our image, with a (relatively) modern, diversified economy.

They're now our competition, and it will only get worse.

China manufactures 25 million cars a year.  We make 12 million.  They don't buy from us.  They make it themselves.

And no, free trade is a failure and a sham if you have the high ground.  

It always fails.

It failed Britain in the late Victorian period, and it's failing us now.

Read this, you'll understand.

http://www.nationaleconomicseditorial.com/america-betrayed/
gotta sell those rags

but, yes, he is !!!
&gt; It failed Britain in the late Victorian period,

IIRC, Britain was doing just fine as the sole world superpower until after WWII, when the USA eclipsed them. The decline hardly began in the late Victorian era.

Serious question: Cut off China from America. What does China lose and what does America lose? Like it or not, China does not and will not ever have an engineering economy like the USA. Japan and Korea and India have all tried to replicate the talent we have here in the US, unsuccessfully. What is it about Chinese culture that suggests they will finally surpass the US in engineering? As far as I can tell, engineering seems to be something on Western Europeans are good at, Americans in particular. What good are factories without engineers to design them and the products they make?

Another serious question: Why can't both America and China succeed together? Why does our success depend on China's failure, and China's success depend on our failure? Or do you think a long-term trading alliance with China is bad for America because there are more Chinese out there than Americans? Why do you think Britain was so forceful in demanding the trade barriers come down with China if trade with China is such a bad thing?

You can go through history and try and find one instance where the free market was surpassed by a planned or controlled economy. All we need is one example.
You don't recall correctly.  British investment in both America and Germany helped them to industrialize much more rapidly than they otherwise could have.

British money is what fueled Germany's industrialization under Bismarck, which turned them into the larger economy before WWI.  The decline began in the 1870s, and accelerated rapidly in the 1890s (when Europeans adopted stronger protectionist measures).

You make my point for me—we should reduce our trade before we become completely dependent.  Right now, America doesn't even make laptops, mobile phones, or even spoons and forks.  It's import dependency, plain and simple.  Why would you want us to depend upon China for our quality of life?

We have an engineering and design edge, but let's not pretend that it's not eroding.  The number of patents filed in America relative to the rest of the world has been dropping precipitously.

We can succeed together, but the point is to maintain our advantage.  We've already lost our production advantage, we shouldn't surrender our technology advantage as well.

America, and the world, is safer when America is the hegemon.  Right now, by empowering China, we're moving again into a bi-polar world.  Soon it'll be a great powers type setup, as we funnel more and more wealth into other large economies.  That's much more dangerous.  Increased friction and competition leads to increased conflict.

Britain opened China for trade because the Canon System made trade a one-way street (British silver for Chinese tea/silk/porcelain).  Britain wanted to correct their balance of trade because they ran out of silver, and they couldn't afford Chinese imports any more.

Their crippling trade deficit brought them to war with China.

And no, there's never been a nation that's long remained rich when they let their wealth flow away.  Rich countries protect their advantage by ensuring economic activity remains within the country. 
It's official now. Before was just speculation, now he's announced.
Let us never forget.
I think I can put my finger on why you are having a problem with free trade.

First, you think free trade is imbalanced trade. This simply isn't the case. Whenever two people trade with each other, it benefits both of them as long as they have enough information and as long as they aren't coerced. The logical foundation of free trade is sound and perfect.

Second, you have a problem with Chinese people getting rich. I don't understand this mindset, really, I don't. In the ten commandments, we are commanded not to covet each other's property. When you think about it, there's a good reason for this. Whether or not someone else is rich really doesn't affect you. In fact, it's much better to be surrounded by people richer than you than poorer than you, because it means you have more opportunities to get rich.

I am not a globalist in that I don't think it's smart to have one world government. (There is a form of government I wouldn't mind, but I don't think it will work so I am against any kind of world government at this point.)

I am a globalist in that I don't see why people get hung up on what cultures or heritages people come from. If Chinese people get rich, so what? If Arabs get rich, so what? If they threaten us, let's kill them. If they want to buy and sell, let's trade.

I am also a globalist because I would like all the best of the best from the world over to come to America and become American.

Remember the 80s, when we were trading with Japan and they were taking off like a rocket and we made movies about how the Japanese were going to rule the world? What happened?

What happened was the wealthiest Japanese moved to America and became Americans. The best companies moved to America and became American. (Toyota, for instance.) The sad truth is that even though Japan was doing well and catching up to America, they didn't have the right culture and right government policies to make it like America or surpass America, and so people that wanted to be like America just moved to America and became American.

We're seeing a similar exodus from China. Rich and smart Chinese people are moving to America, learning to speak English, and taking upon themselves the things that make us American. They like freedom. They like being able to talk about how bad the government is. They like the fact that Americans don't really care who you are, we just want your money and to leave us alone.

Let's say China decides they want to build America 2.0. They reform their government, they reform their policies, they even reform their culture so that China is even more American than America. You know what? You and I would probably be some of the first people to jump on a boat and sail to China if that were the case. So if China wants to do that, I am all for it. If China ends up being better than America, then I'm going to learn how to speak Chinese and I'm going to move to China.

America isn't a place or a culture or a heritage or a skin color, it's an idea of how people can live together in peace and prosperity. If the rest of the world wants to be like us, then I'm all for it. If that means we trade with them and they get rich too, so be it!
1) Free trade between asymmetrical partners will necessarily be unbalanced.  Money (like water) flows to the lowest point until both are equal.  If you have the advantage, you better protect it, or you'll slowly lose it.

2) Listen, enriching China is bad because it:

a) Endangers America by creating a rival power.  This will lead to tensions.  For example, if China's GDP was 1/4 of what it is now, do you think they'd be aggressive in the South China Sea?  Strong rivals increases the risk of war.

You never see war started by countries with a severe economic or power disadvantage—it's either between equals or caused by the larger entity.

A larger China means more conflict, and trouble for America and her allies.

b) We shouldn't be trading with and enriching China (relative to America or absolutely).  They're a vile authoritarian dictatorship that slaughters Christians and destroys churches.  They kill their own people.  They have imperialistic ambitions on the Philippines and in Africa.

A powerful China is bad for the world.  So is a powerful Saudi Arabia.

3) There's not fair or free trade with China: it's a 1 way street.  It's American companies vs the Chinese government.  Of course our boys will lose.

Disruptor in Chief!
I don't understand why, there is this negative reaction to kellogg's all they did was stop advertising on breitbart.
That's interesting to read about different ways to measure the unemployment, but I'm a bit confused. He didn't include a chart of the U-6 rates, so is this the right one? Not sure if this link works...

http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS13327709

Anyway, it looks like in 2008 it went up by 9 percentage points, and since then it's come down fairly consostently to within about a point and a half. That seems like pretty good progress, no? I mean, it was a couple points better in 2001, but that's the lowest point in the past 20 years (all the data on the chart). The article sounded a little pessimistic, but it seems like significant positive progress has been made and is still taking place. Am I misreading it?

Edit: fixed link, but you'll have to add more history in the graph by clicking the drop down yourself - I guess I can't include that in the link.
Stop whining Hilary it's over.

To be fair, Newsweek has been not a real news source for much longer than some of the others.
Your point (1) is obviously wrong. Why would a poor man trade with Donald Trump if they knew they are better off not trading at all? *The only trades that happen in free market benefit both people.* While it may be true that Donald Trump would benefit more than the poor person, the poor person still gets a benefit (unless they are stupid or compelled to trade with Donald Trump).

Regarding (2), if *we as a peaceful trading partner* enriches China, then by definition, *China cannot be belligerent with the US.* Because to do so would spoil the source of their wealth and defund their military. In order for China to become a rival power and not a trade partner, they would have to develop that wealth without trading with the US. The Soviets understood this and that's why they didn't trade with the West. You can't exactly use the money you get from trade to kill your trade partner and expect the money to keep flowing. (There's a fable about this called the Golden Goose.)

Regarding 2 (b), the way you stop vile dictators is you empower the people to rise up against them. The people in the British colonies in America rose up against their masters *because* they were wealthy and free to do so. If they were poor, they wouldn't have the free time or resources to raise an army that could successfully stand against the British. SO if you want to overthrow tyrants, you make the people they oppress rich, and they will overthrow the tyrants themselves. Or the tyrants will figure out you can't cross rich people and get away with it for very long.

Regarding (3), let's suppose you have a state actor trading with a free actor. Under what conditions would trade occur? Can the state actor compel the free actor to trade? It may work for a time, but eventually, the free actors find a way to severe their ties to the state actor. For instance, companies like Apple have offshore manufacturing facilities and build and sell iPhones that never pass across any of the borders of the US. Or perhaps the free actors find all the lucrative benefits and side deals to be too tasty to ignore. What is happening then? Why, the state actor is using its power to destroy to pillage their own people and then giving that money to the free actors. In such a case, why wouldn't you want to be the free actor?

If China is foolish enough to bankrupt their own country and impoverish them just to get the temporary attention of American businesses, I say, LET THEM! We carry home the profits of them pillaging their own people. What's the bad side of that? You say you want China to be weak --- well, that's a sure road to weakness. You say you want to overthrow their tyranny --- well, that's what will eventually happen when they run out of other people's money.

From a logical and reasonable standpoint, in no case does free trade not make the most sense. Let people choose, and then let them suffer the consequences or reap the rewards from those choices.
prolly not

The DNC are idiots.  But anyone who isn't outraged when election rigging occurs is also an idiot.  Unfortunately, two huge hits to the Nation's confidence do not make for a stronger Nation.

Find out if there was rigging, find out how to fix things, prevent future rigging, and increase transparency of those in power when it comes to how they treat our own nation.

Alternative headline: "Democrats outraged at Russia for their own incompetence"
Sorry, any publication with an article like "Libertarians And The Alt-Right: Brothers In Arms Toward Leftist Destruction" is not one I'm going to even read.
BASED Russia 
Russia and America used to do this sort of thing all the time during the Cold War.  Sometimes they even invaded countries to ensure that they would align with their interests (eg Korea, Vietnam, Granada, Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia).  Russia has also proved capable of influencing American public thought (see Operation INFEKTION).  So this story is believable.  But to what extent did Putin's regime influence the election, and where is the evidence?
Correct.
She won the state, so id hope they vote for her.  Same with all other states.  Vote the way the people tell you to, thats your job.
No.  

The job of the Electoral College voters is to make sure that someone with the will/ignorance to harm the Republic, doesn't get a hold of the office of President of the United States.  Their job is to literally vote for what's best for the country, regardless of the popular vote or party affiliation.

* Objective view: [Rehosted FEC commentary](http://uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php)

The intent of the Colorado Electoral College voters taking the issue to court isn't about their vote, but to get SCOTUS to weigh in on the matter of states requiring an Electoral College voter to vote a certain way.

The North Carolina counterpart was struck down by the courts because the lawmakers literally looked up voter demographic data by race while writing the bill.
Ugh.  That read like someone who wants to know what they are talking about, and has a byline to sell.

It hinges on the single idea that the CIA ONLY checked that the computer it originated from was in Russia.

How poor of an investigative team does he think the CIA is?!  It's like telling a politician that they don't know anything about politics, because of some scene the reporter watched on West Wing.

I've been listening to the Thrawn series, and was amazed at how this sounded exactly like the Bothan Politician Freylia.  He asks a question with only his logic to back it up, and miraculously, everyone thought he must be right. 

Are we so shallow that we only need someone telling us, "I don't believe them.", to throw away all knowledge, logic, wisdom, experience, and recorded evidence so we can fall in line behind the nay-sayer?

Take a look at the evidence before you side with fast-talking, non-technical, conspiracy theorists like this.  Find the real truth, not this swill.
I dont get why republicans are willing to disparage our intelligence community, seven different intelligence agencies came to the same conclusion and they still feel like this is a fight they want to have. Its like they think democrats are a bigger enemy than russia. This hack should outrage all Americans instead republicans become defensive like they think they did something wrong.
Ah yes, do exactly what Russia actually wanted: Undermining the trust in democracy. 
very well written

gotta admit it, Romney had me fooled for 2012.  I was sure he was a plenty good Republican and would defeat Obama.  boy was I whacked.  it took Trump to pound Romney into pesto

Thanks Donald
Don't assume that because DJT was elected, he will become president. It's up to us to PEACEFULLY make sure he is. Please share this with all the Trump supporters you know. Thank you

"The only thing evil men need to triumph is for good men to do nothing "-Edmond Burke
the libtards will go crazy, but I think the access to vote should be via property tax records.  if you pay/paid your property taxes, you can vote
What do you do when you rent?  You are effectively paying for the property tax but have no own-able land but still contribute to the tax via paying rent.  So only the owners of the property can vote but not the ones actually paying the taxes?  Very weird solution you have.  It only takes account of who owns it but not who is actually paying it.
voting ONLY if you own property goes back to considerations disscused by the Founding Fathers.  owners, yes, all else, no.  Federalist Papers have coverage

&gt; but not who is actually paying it

that's never the case, e.g. do you ever hear taxpayers put a man on the moon?  no, government wants the credit

however, if people were who see/agree that corporations pay no taxes, we'd all be better off.  the whole debate about corporate profits tax is looney because business simply tacks on taxes to the final price of goods = you and me (consumers) pay every penny every day..but all that is another subject "-)
Very fair point.  Was confused for a minute.    I see what you're implying now though.
Very scary stuff indeed. 
The CIA, whose official job is to detect foreign threats to the United States, reported the source of the hack.  We should be mad if the President *doesn't* go after Russia.  The CIA did not make this up to undermine Trump; it has nothing to gain and a lot to lose by doing so.  The CIA might be incompetent, but it's hilarious how conspiracy theorists think the CIA is either a bunch of idiots who couldn't spot a terrorist if all of al-Qaeda sat on their heads, or so brilliantly cunning that they are secretly responsible for every calamity in modern history.
I understand wanting to stick it to the other side, but this is clearly a matter of cutting off the nose to spite the face. It's undermining faith in the democratic process to a worrisome degree. 
He is a plenty good Republican. 
I am a liberal and ok with that if we get rid of all other taxes. Taxation without representation and all.
Considering that the lower levels are full of millenials now and that Brennan has politicized it... even Assange says it wasn't Russia.
I know. Did they hack it or was it not them as Assange admitted. So did Russia influence the election? Perhaps but not by hacking.
Needs auto tune 
Lol peace prospects.  The only time we will have a successful peace treaty between Israel and her surrounding enemies it will be right before the Apocalypse. 
"Peace prospects will be dead" says the country who wants to eradicate Israel from the surface of the earth
We're still not looking at what was investigated, only what people are claiming.  This is a ridiculous way of handling things, especially because people are acting so volatile right now.

LOL....says Palestinian aide.  LOL  those jerkwads have never wanted peace
That's about Brexit far more than Trump.
Romney is probably a decent guy... But Obama was just really overall cooler and more popular.  Wonder how Trump would have done VS Obama?
He likely would have lost.  Obama ran two really good campaigns and was able to connect with the voters.  Obama and Trump, if you look past the partisan grandstanding, also shared quite a few voters.  Given how many people voted for Hillary just because they hated Trump, imagine if they had a candidate people actually liked.
You know putting funny in the title doesn't make it true right. We can see the video
Lol, those people who were forced out of their own homes by jewish refugees fleeing europe after the second world war, have never wanted peace. Is that that what you meant?
I am a democrat, and I support Trump ascending to the presidency even though I disagree with his politics. I can't stand Alex Jones though. He says some pretty stupid stuff. For example when he claimed hurricanes were controlled by the president or something stupid along those lines. 
He looks like a cross between Glenn beck and Mitt Romney.

What made America great, when did it stop being great, and how did we lose that thing that made America great?

I'm saying this because it feels like just another vapid slogan.  Didn't Obama promise "change we can believe in"?
Didn't you read the article? There has been a war on Christmas, so we elected Donald Trump president, where he proceeded to invent a time machine to travel back to 2013, where he joined a Texas school board, and voted to pass a law renaming "Winter Break" to "Christmas Break."   
  
And that is the story of how Trump saved Christmas and made America great again. Pay attention!
Why is there a fluff piece written by a leftist ideologue getting upvotes on a subreddit for Republicans?

It's total bullshit, Obama's foreign policy has been a disaster.  "Obama and Clinton are responsible for warming our relations with Russia?  WTF!  Putin has done nothing but walk all over both of them and routinely talks negatively about them.

Get this nonsense out of here.
I wish I thought of this idea before, especially for the last 8 years :( Hoping to do this for every 4 year term going forward.

Fake story aside, are we pro-Russian now?
One can call out fake news while not pledging allegiance to another country.
Come on the title is loaded with "anti-Russian".  
Twitter isn't a conversation. 
He sure as hell has never sent me a DM. I call shenanigans.
I'm more freaked out by him not having press conferences, like what he criticized Hillary Clinton for. 
My question is, why? The only ones he's accountable to are Middle America. Whenever he has an announcement, he can go straight to the various platforms and undercut the lying, dishonest hacks who tried to destroy Trump -- personally. Most media are scum. Fuck them.
It makes it harder to be held accountable for the validity of what he says or his actions.  Press conferences allow the press to question the statements and actions of anyone in power on both sides of the aisle. Without it those in power dont have to answer the questions that could benefit americans.

He's actually accountable to all Americans now. 
He's accountable to all Americans. And that includes journalists and those who didn't vote for him.

No, this is not hypocrisy because in most cases A COUNTRY CANNOT BE HYPOCRITICAL.  A person can be a hypocrite.  A very large group of human beings cannot be a hypocrite because it's impossible for a very large group of people to form an informed consensus on any matter.  Americans are not the Borg.  Every time the US government interfered in the elections of a foreign state, it was a decision made by the White House and often with little to no input from Congress.  Often this was because of the need for secrecy if nothing else.  There is no law in the US law books that condones meddling in foreign elections, and no President has ever gone on TV to argue why sending in the CIA to slander an inconvenient head of state is a good idea.

The general American public had no input in the decision to mess with Iranian democracy and most Americans didn't even know Iran existed until Iran took some Americans hostage for some unfathomable reason.

Even the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the subsequent regime change is mostly still something the Bush administration decided on.  The American people just went along with it.  After 9/11, the American public felt a great emotional need to punch *somebody* for what happened in New York, but they didn't necessarily want to go to Iraq specifically.  Bush and his neoconservative buddies decided that, and it was easy to sell that to the American public: Iraq was full of Muslims just like al-Qaeda and Saddam was an evil dictator whom the US already went to war with back in the 90s.  Anyone who pointed that Iraq was peripheral at best to the War on Terror was met with the sheep bleating SUPPORT OUR TROOPS OR YOU HATE AMERICA!!

Now Putin ordered his hackers to mess with the US election process.  The American people should respond to this.  Compromising the American democratic process does not punish the American officials who made the decision to meddle with the democracies of Iran or Iraq or Guatemala or whatever.  Most of those guys are retired or dead, and those still in office will not suffer one bit.  The Putin regime is doing this to serve its geopolitical ambitions, not teach America a lesson in humility and empathy.  Compromising American democracy will hurt America, and also affect other democratic states such as in Europe or Japan because these countries have too many close ties to America to not be affected somehow.  It's not even really good for the average Russian.  The average Russian has not benefited from Putin's corruption or his unconstructive wag-the-dog sabre-rattling with the US.

To this end, if the American government retaliates, it must make clear that it is retaliating AGAINST THE PUTIN REGIME, not all Russia.  They must not make all Russians feel like targets, nor encourage irrational russophobia in the American public.  Putin wants this.  Pitting America and Russia against each other is bad for Russia but good for Putin because it rallies the people behind him and distracts them from his corruption.
Shocker
Why are Republicans suddenly defending this guy? Sweden had a child molestation charge and a rape charge against him. Maybe that could be it?
Lets see if the main stream media can defend itself against fake news, or if it just says, sorry, secret sources. 
Unless I'm mistaken, he has been "charged" but not taken to court and convicted, right? So if he hasn't been convicted of a crime, then he shouldn't be referred to as if he had already been convicted of it. I'm not saying whether he did commit the crimes in actuality or not, but either way that isn't relevant, as only his court case would be. CNN should know to be more precise in their language if they can't point at an official document declaring him guilty of rape or molestation or whatever else they put beside his name.
Tough to convict a man hiding in an embassy...
Why are democrats selling him out? 
If you had told me 2 years ago that the left would be lambasting Assange and the right defending him I'd consider you completely insane. 

Intellectual consistency is rarer than I've seen in all my life.
IMO, there was no investigation.  FBI corruption and partisanship must be rooted out, drain the FBI swamp.  prima facie, what's to conclude except Clinton malfeasance and corruption?  FBI investigation should have been FBI confirmation of those facts.  Hillary should be in jail
The article compared several individuals who deliberately gave away state secrets to someone who mis-handled declassified documents where someone missed removing a "c" buried in the text of the document.

Regardless it's hard to imagine spending over $100 million investigating for every American over three decades despite never finding anything illegal. That's an awful lot of witch hunting.
While I would agree we need stronger whistle blower protections, and less surveillance of citizens, bulk or otherwise, the outrage the article referred to was more centered on Comey's letter to Congress. An FBI director playing an activist role in an election is outrageous.
&gt;So if he hasn't been convicted of a crime, then he shouldn't be referred to as if he had already been convicted of it.

So two years ago, you'd have been against referring to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as a terrorist?
I don't know the timeline of Tsarnaev, but yes I am definitely against referring to someone as a terrorist without a court conviction. The news agency isnt responsible for determining or assigning guilt but only for reporting what others said about it. For the media to do otherwise would violate the accused's presumption of innocence until proven guilty. The more heinous the crime, the more important that precision of language is.

To be clear, that's not to say that the news shouldn't report on the incident. For example, before the trial concludes it is acceptable to say that "The US Attorney General has charged John Smith with fourteen counts of murder in the first degree." It may also be acceptable to present to the public a video or other information that will be presented as evidence in the case. It is not acceptable to say "Alleged murderer John Smith killed fourteen people" because it forms the presumption of guilt by placing his name next to "murderer" as well as by assuming his guilt by forming the sentence that way. We can trust that the police on scene reported fourteen deaths, and we can report that information, but it is not their responsibility to assign guilt.

After the trial it is acceptable to say that "John Smith in *US v John Smith* was found guilty of four counts of murder in the fourth degree and eight counts of murder in the second degree" or whatever other outcome took place.

I understand that in many cases the situation seems obvious given our availability of evidence, but it is still the responsibility of the courts to determine guilt and of the media to fairly disseminate information.

I am also not suggesting that language or evidence is perfectly clear in every circumstance, and it may sometimes be difficult to accurately portray information through the intracacies of language. Plus, people including reporters make mistakes, so I'm not suggesting any media outlet have a perfect record.

Here's an example of someone else discussing some intracacies of the word "allege".

http://www.cjr.org/language_corner/jumping_off_allege.php

Here's the current nytimes headline: " Florida Airport Assailant May Have Heard Voices Urging 
Violence, Officials Say". It's clear that this us what the officials said, not what the nytimes concluded. They want headlines to be as concise as possible, but the officials are important I'm that headline and so they are left in.

http://nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/fort-lauderdale-airport.html

Here's another example, in regards to the live video stream of four teenagers attacking a disabled teen. The video exists, but the guilt of the teenagers hasn't been decided by the court, and so the nytimes report the legal terms as precisely as they can.

&gt;The victim in the attack here, an 18-year-old white man, suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, prosecutors said in court papers filed on Friday. The four accused attackers, ranging in age from 18 to 24, are black. The four appeared on Friday in Cook County Circuit Court and Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered them held without bail.

So?
Yeah really. Who gives a shit?
Belgium has three official languages... French Dutch and German... it's not like England where everyone speaks English!  And he didn't move to a foreign country, he's a British Government official who has to live there.  By the time he learned a new language he would likely be back in Britain.  This like asking a Japanese tourist why they didn't learn English before visiting New York.  

This sounds like a morons argument on why no one who moves to a new country should learn the language.  
A president never truly retires, they almost always continue in one or more of their missions. From Jimmy Carter with his foundation aiding in peace negotiations in Africa to George W. Bush painting the portraits of wounded veterans and giving the profits to a Military Service Initiative that supports veterans and honors them. 
I'm not sure if his actions these last few weeks give me much hope for his future efforts. he seems to be causing problems intentionally. President Obama has disappointed me greatly in his undermining of President Elect Trump. he may have started out as a man of good intentions; but he is now, nothing more than a bitter jack-ass.

it took Reagan 30 months to turn the ship around after Jimmy Carter (improving government stats).  since Obama is leaving us with [an even worse mess](https://i.redditmedia.com/Pu3JZaE38h5Xt7MNcIMXimqlCms1jbbU55pMk3MFXr8.jpg?w=990&amp;s=01ab1299b36e9af3e2ef0ef396caabf1), it will take at least that long (I think)
What has he done, that makes you feel this way?
Allowing the UN resolution against Israel.

Sanctions against Russia.

Critical remarks about President Elect Trump's personality.

Intentional mishandling the Chinese theft of US remote control submersible.
Possibly. While I have fond thoughts of President Reagan, I don't believe he operated at the same level as President Elect Trump. I'm expecting a turn around in less than the first year. Of course; the media won't report it, and will try to convince people things aren't improving.
&gt; I'm expecting a turn around in less than the first year.

Congress.  I don't trust those republicans (establishment).  He'll have to tweet them into line :-)
There is plenty of common ground to start out on. Once they start thinking re-election; they will realize that they want to be on his nice list.
Allowing the UN resolution against Israel, is more easily repaired than you think, Trump has a good relationship with the Israeli leaders and will likely ruin our relationship with Palestine. Who in all reality is a more strategic ally. (If you want Muslims in the middle east to change their minds about america that is.) If you would like to know more about that I can expand. 

Sanctions against Russia Seem to with the exception of Trump himself to have been widely applauded by members of both parties in congress. So that aids well in the transition in all reality. 

I haven't heard him be critical of Trump since he won. If you could provide me a link to something showing this I would be happy to address it. 

What was the mishandling here by Obama? It seems from what I have read that Trumps tweets complicated matters, especially since his call with the Taiwanese president broke precedent for the US as it is according to China part of China. Which has been recognized as a fact by the US government since the 1970s.


First, it is not a relationship that needs repairing with Israel; it is the damage it does to the negotiating position of Israel and President Elect Trump in dealing with issues in the Middle East. Second, in the primary, then candidate Trump was criticized for saying that he wanted to be a 'neutral' negotiator of a final peace agreement. That is as far as I think he needs to go; as I have no interest in placating the muslims in the Middle East any further. For  over 10 years we have bent over backward to show our tolerance, it is now time to show our intolerance for terrorism against the West and those who support it.

The sanctions are only applauded by spineless career politicians who don't want to appear weak on national security. Republicans as a whole are not in favor of the sanctions and do not believe it is in the best interest of America to antagonize the globes only other superpower.

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-nuclear-barack-obama-concerns-233143

The call to the President of Taiwan was a brilliant strategic move by President Elect Trump. It put Taiwan back on the negotiating table, to be used by him as a future bargaining chip. Anyone who has negotiated professionally knows that before the negotiation begins, you want to expose your opponents weaknesses and increase their needs; so there will be additional leverage to achieve more of the mutually desired positions. The submersible should never have been in jeopardy in the first place. There was no need to have it being used in that theater at this time.
The idea of a "gun free zone" sounds as silly as the idea of a "drug free zone".  In some cities the drug-free zones are so ubiquitous that drug dealers and users are forced to ignore them.  Law of unintended consequences, eh?
So clearly I do need to expand. Israel was founded after world war 2 when Jewish holocaust survivors fled germany and nearby countries to their historical homeland in what was Palestine, a muslim nation. Now, Britain had control over the area and essentially funneled in the Jewish refugees slowly creating Jewish refugee camps. These refugee camps held tons of weapons scavenged or stolen on the way to Palestine. These Jewish people who had been radicalized as a result of systematic persecution decided they wanted to create their own safe haven nation so that they could be safe from this persecution. They then created plans of attack and began mortaring palestine the same day the british left the country of palestine, creating the current Israeli occupation of Palestine. Now it is fairly simple to see that there are some parallels between ISIS and Israel (just want to say now I don't condone either's actions in regards to their attempts at forming their nations.) Now let's skip to modern day Israel/Palestine we have two independent countries attempting to occupy the same land which is why Israel is an occupation force and therefore is not legally allowed to start building Israeli settlements in land that has been determined by their own treaties with Palestine to be Palestinian land. Now the US has for years been allies with Israel which is a large reason nearby muslim nations hate America, and funding is being given to ISIS, they see no difference between what ISIS is doing and what the Jewish people did after WW2. They see America's invasion of Iraq as having been groundless and an excuse to kill Muslims. If America and the EU sided more with Palestine the support for ISIS is actually more likely to dry up leaving them to disperse and fall apart as support falters, or unified efforts destroy the organization. 

I haven't seen many criticize the sanctions with the exception of far right career pundits. The people who are paid to feign anger at anything a democrat does (ex Alex Jones). Democrats have them too, though I don't think as many are paid, but (ex. Al Sharpton)

That's a staffer reiterating what Obama said during the election and saying that he is unlikely to have changed his opinion. He didn't openly say anything. 

It was a dumb move, and is the reason the submersible was in jeopardy. The submersible was for scientific purposes and they regularly launch these submersibles near the larger naval ships. But I will admit there is no need for our military to regularly be anywhere that deep into the pacific, we should give Japan full rights to having a military again and close our bases left over from WW2. Pack up and go home. 
Palestine was not, and never will be a full nation. If the Palestinian people do not learn to live in peace with their Jewish neighbors; they will need to be exterminated.
They aren't the aggressors Israel is. 
Israel isn't an aggressor yet. If the Palestinians persist in their attacks against Israel and America; they will be met with extermination.
Israel has always been the aggressor, when you willingly, knowingly and purposefully launch mortars at a civilians homes and murder civilians in the streets you are not only are the aggressor, you are guilty of war crimes. 

Israel is the one that is violating the agreements they made which is why they had sanctions placed against them. Palestine hasn't attacked America I don't know where you got that idea. 
And the importance of mental health care and VA services. 
Or maybe they're baiting Trump into giving them some deal.
Fuck.no. and he's already said as much in interviews.
Actually, 11.3 million jobs created will be Obama's legacy.

wonder if what I heard may be right?  Hillary for Mayor of NY
one thing I respect about democrats/liberals is they **NEVER** give up

they fight on and on for their agenda no matter what
&gt; Those rumors that Hillary Clinton might run for mayor of New York City? Don’t believe it, one longtime Clinton confidante said Sunday -- 2016 was Clinton’s last campaign ever.
I can't respect someone without a brain. 
If the D's were smart they'd start calling this the McConnell Rule.  As a counter to how the Rs called the obstruction of the Judiciary the Biden Rule. 
Why are these people always so goddamn emotional?
The mental gymnastics trumpettes need to do to justify Trump mocking a disabled reporter is astounding. Saying he's a bully and mocks everyone this way doesn't justify it, it makes it worse.
He waved his hands around mocking confusion on many occassions.  He did it to ted cruz and he did it to this reporter.  This reporter doesn't wave his hands.  The mental gymnastics required to link what he did to this reporters disability are what amaze me.  It's similar to the creative interpretation that "she was bleeding from her eyes.... bleeding from her whatever" really meant she was so mad that it made her menstruate. 
&gt; Just to clarify: I do NOT identify as Alt-Right, I merely am explaining them as I feel many of the other explanations/descriptions are flawed.﻿


LOL!
Fact checkers such as: Politifact. Truly, a prestigious site with no biased leanings what so ever, with a beautiful track record. Ignore the fact the Tampa Bay Times endorsed Hillary Clinton, and they own Politifact as well, that's irrelevant.
"Fact checkers."
"Trump said sky is blue"

Factcheckers: Mostly false the sky is sometimes gray depending on the weather and due to climate change which he denies it is mostly gray.

I guess we found who the real liars are with something to gain! Damned media. /s 
WRONG. There are always cops with guns everywhere there.  I need to take these crazy pills you guys are on to see what it's like 
Please know this is a terrible, terrible precedent. If the next Obama comes in and tries to shoehorn his appointees through like this...won't we be pissed? We won't have a leg to stand on when arguing against it.

If both sides keep up this tactic of cheating and then justifying it by calling out the other team for having done the same thing...then just what the fuck. When does it end?

My mother (I'm sure many of ours) taught me at an early age that's no way to conduct yourself and get ahead in life. But our presidents can act like this? 
He seems pissed...
He seems pissed...
You're admonished.
Given the amount of times Trump has promoted fake news himself, this just comes off as weak and sad. Truly a hypocrite.
Out out out
Why would he do so many interviews with them and send so many surrogates to work at a fake news organization?
Calls CNN fake news, takes a question from Breitbart. 
Well they are.
Trump will make people nostalgic for Obama just like Bush made people nostalgic for Clinton.
But it was certainly an influence, no? 

Most people have a problem with the influence. No one I talk to seems to see it as the election being hacked but rather influenced.
Yeah remember that time Breitbart gave the debate questions to Clinton before the debate? Or that time Breitbart said people aren't allowed to read WikiLeaks? Or that time Breitbart reported on a completely unverified 'memo' that was clearly a 12 year olds fanfiction? Or that time Breitbart cut people off the air when they went against the narrative and blamed technical issues? Or that time Breitbart said Trump had sexually assaulted dozens of women who all coincidentally stopped pursuing anything after it was proven to likely be bullshit?  
  
Oh wait... CNN did all those things. 
'Member when President's had dignity
Obama is a wonderfully dignified President.  I haven't heard any conservative critic bash him for lack of dignity - and remember, these are guys who had to come up with stupid bullshit like *he's really a Kenyan Muslim commie with a fake birth certificate* because they couldn't find any real dirt on him.
The sky is black
people will be to busy working at real jobs to worry about Obama, I can see people been nostalgic of Obama, when they are no longer on welfare and have to get a job!
Lol this article is made up of lies. 1. The buzzfeed leak was the 30+ page collection of memos showing Trumps alleged ties to Russia and other perversions. It was not the two page report the IC used to brief Obama and Trump. 2. CNN did report, and does not deny, that the IC briefed Obama and Trump about the unverified allegations and that they, the IC, while they being able to verify the allegations did consider the source reliable. They were the first to report not Buzzfeed as OPs link suggests and their report did not mention details of the memo. Buzzfeed used CNNs report as an excuse to leak the memos. 
But unemployment has gone down under Obama

One diner? Seriously? The wage increase will shut down most mom and pop shops. It was something Obama really wanted to do for the same reasons he ended the shuttle missions. Americans take pride in both. 
AP is fake news
I have eaten there, the minimum wage increasing wouldn't be what shuts down that restaurant.
Tl:Dr the left are thought police and they want to take our guns

The author is a nut job
Lewis was quite right, given the Russian meddling in the election campaigns. Add Comey's interference. 

Unfair election campaign process &gt;&gt;&gt; illegitimate result.  
&gt; While President-elect Trump has established himself and his new inner circle as the top of the Republican Party, Senator Paul took his stand with the support of his former rival. Instead of being attacked by constituents and being blacklisted in his own party, he is gaining favor.

This was clear for Trump supporters from the start. There's much to cooperate and Trump will need help, which is good for both sides.

The other day the libertarian party was agitating against Trump because of the repeal of Obamacare. The libertarian subreddit wasn't even aware the reform was being led by one of their own.
This article is written terribly.
This video is old and trash. Unemployment is not at 8.3%. It is 4.7%.

Steve Harvey is a huge pile of shit as a person, but to say that this is just a ploy by Donald Trump to win over black people is pretty disingenuous. They're specifically saying he hasn't spoke to any note worthy black leaders which is completely [untrue](http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Donald-Trump-Meeting-With-African-American-Leaders-in-Philly-Friday-392078491.html).


What is real news then? Please send links to articles from which you drew credence. 
Oh on Don "sour hour" Lemon's show, what a surprise.
The DNC leaks may have influenced the elections, but the Russians didn't actually rig the elections themselves. It would be hypocritical of me to condemn this leak when I celebrated the Manning leaks, the Snowden leaks, and the Panama Papers.  Should I condemn the DNC hack just because of the perpetrator's identity? The Russians are sitting on whatever they stole from the Trump team, but then again in every election the public gets incomplete information.
You can bet anything that the next time Democrats have the power to do this ... or sit on a supreme court nomination, etc., they will. Why should they play by one set of rules when the other party plays by another? 
who joined him during the last republican inauguration?
What do you mean? 
poorly written
pretty sure he boycotted W bush inauguration...nobody joined him then?
You overestimate voter memory. When the news goes on for weeks/months about taking away healthcare from 18+ million people, this won't even be a blip of a memory.
that was pretty much my point, no body, not even HE remembered he boycotted the last inauguration.
And the republicans after those democrats will do the same, and the democrats after them, and so on and so on.  Why do we even bother wasting our time and energy debating these things when we know that no matter what side we're on we're just gonna allow our officials to skirt their way around rules so that "at least we got what we wanted"

I would like our officials to act in this manner and set that precedent, that we're better than the Dems because we follow fair play. That way we can call them on their bullshit and actually have it mean a damn. This "but the bad guy did it too!" mentality makes me sick. My officials act like my 5 year old nephew.

Edit: second paragraph
LOL
"personal?" 
He wrote a lot of it himself is what they are talking about. Rather than have a writer do it. Seems like a poorly written article.
I think there may have been a few people but its been more publicized with Trump by the media.

It makes me wonder if the GOP ever boycotted an inauguration when a Democrat was elected?
This is a terribly written article. Anyway, on the subject of safe spaces, yes it is ridiculous for minorities in colleges to demand areas that only their race can enter. We had that once, it was called segregation, and Dr Martin Luther King Jr is probably rolling in his grave after hearing a black person suggest that. However, alot of the "safe spaces" that colleges are talking about are areas that students who are having trouble dealing with recent events can go for support. These are still kids we are talking about, the human brain doesn't fully mature until 25. They are allowed to ask for help. However, it blows my mind that Republicans can crticize liberal colleges for "safe spaces" yet the recently elected president is the biggest man child of them all, lashing out at anyone who criticizes him in the slightest. You were elected to be the head of the most powerful country on Earth, when your in public you don't get a "safe space" where you are free from criticism.
If you can't pay your employees a living wage for full time work then your business is being supported by Federal welfare; either on the front-end in the form of tax benefits, or on the back-end in the form of social programs to subsidize your employees lack of a living wage. The free market dictates that your business is no longer solvent and should die. Waving the banner of welfare, of any kind, in the name of small business is not something to be proud of, even if it is a strong feel-good motivation. Part of the American promise is fair pay for fair work. That is how we hold ourselves above nations that treat their workforce like slaves. Yes, we have the highest quality of life of any nation, even for our poorest (speaking relatively), but that does not mean we should not aim higher. Complacency is the midden heap that spawns apathy, and apathy is the greatest anathema to prosperity. 

*tl;dr: I'm piggybacking off [parent](https://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/5nuwvq/why_the_minimum_wage_increase_may_shut_down_dees/dcf34t5/) and expanding it with my thoughts on why we shouldn't defend small business for the the sake of defending small business.*
Nope.
lol not even close. You'd have to be extremely bias and lacking in any sort of historical knowledge to think so. 
But... but... my emotions tell me he is! My gut is more valid than history or valid media sources!
I dunno, I mean FDR probably did more lasting damage to our system of government. 
James Buchanan is the worst according to most people judging objectively
 
Easily the worst in my lifetime, going back to Carter.  Obama purposely tried to turn American citizens against each other, for that alone he will always be a huge pile of shit in my book; add in his idiotic ideals that he pushed for and passed and that pile of shit just gets bigger.

Reagan was easily the best.


Not even close?  

Under his leadership we added more debt than every president before him combined.  We never achieved even 3% GDP growth, an absolute failure and a first for any president.  Poverty increased, wage stagnation, more people on welfare and food stamps than ever in our history, making unconstitutional appointments, and on and on.

Really?  Not even close?
You do realize the debt increase had a lot to do with the previous administration right? Wars that he did not start largely contributed to that debt. Tax cuts he extended but did not implement contributed to that debt. GOP blocking his every move contributed to that debt. I stand by my claims. 
So the leader of the country bears no blame for the direction of the country?  

Every budget put forth by Obama increased spending, if it weren't for the GOP led House we would have added even more debt.  The majority of the war spending happened during the Bush Administration, and defense spending declined during the Obama Administration.

Does Obama bear no responsibility for extending tax cuts during his time as president?  

What specifically did the GOP do that caused the debt to increase?  

Your claims are idiotic and based on bullshit.  Let's see your specifics, back up your claims.
I'd say Obama is not as bad as Buchanan, but maybe in Hoover or Carter territory.
You can only lead those willing to follow. You know POTUS has limited power. If congress blocks his moves what is he to do? Executive action but you all love to hate on him for that as well. 

Specifically? Let's see invaded Iraq on a series of lies for starters. Not raising taxes to pay for that war compounded the debt.

Overall it declined during his administration but during the early years it did not. Is he not credited for that? 

I implied he had some responsibility for extending tax cuts. Don't think he would have got tax increases through congress though. 
What, you think Obama is the first president to face stiff opposition?  Mr. "elections have consequences" fuck Republicans Obama is just a poor weak president bullied by a minority party?

What debt reduction policies did Obama push for that the Republican congress kept from happening?  A specific Bill number would be nice.

Exactly how much do you think we spent on the wars during Obama's 8 years?  You seem to be under the impression that the large majority of spending was war spending.  Do yourself a favor and look at a federal budget.

[Here are all the tax increases passed during Obama's 8 years](http://www.atr.org/full-list-ACA-tax-hikes-a6996).  It's obvious you are talking out of your ass and are ignorant about this.
Oh so you admit that there was stiff opposition. That's a good start. 

Oh about $700 billion per year of the $3.5-$4 trillion being spent. Just a drop in the bucket really. Not a large majority but second only to social security in terms of percentage. 

Not really sure how that fits. I do not see an income tax hike there and everything appeared to be tied to the ACA. These tax hikes were necessary to pay for the increased cost in Medicare. Obama did try and raise taxes on the wealthiest 2% by not extending the Bush tax cuts for them. GOP filibustered that plan. Agree with it or not that would have helped reduce the deficit. 
Americans have been polarizing ever since the Civil Rights Act, if you ask me.  I remember political observers complaining of the bipartisan divide as far back as Bill Clinton.  It's not Obama's fault.
Yes.  I lived through Carter and the punishment was severe with gas lines, rationing, astronomical interest rates, malaise and a feckless international standing...to name a few

but Obama did all that and FAR FAR more.  e.g. the [WORST economic record](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/04/simply-worst-obama-first-president-ever-not-see-single-year-3-gdp/) of any president in American history

Obamacare and its endless lies is just the tip of the iceberg.  LIES into the face of all American is unforgivable (you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, you'll save $2,500 a year).  but there's [much much more](http://townhall.com/columnists/johnhawkins/2014/08/09/50-things-barack-obama-has-done-wrong-n1876744)
Acknowledging systemic racism is apparantly "turning the nation against one another."
LNN is poor writing
I mean to be fair I feel you have to judge presidents by both what they do during and after the presidency and Carter has done some amazing work both during and after his presidency. Seriously the guy not being reelected didn't end him working. He just started going around the world helping people. Both directly and indirectly with habitat for humanity which he has volunteered with for years, and through the carter center he has done lots of work with helping to keep the peace in poorer countries as well as funding research on diseases. Its why he rightfully won the nobel peace prize. I don't really agree with Obama's because I feel it was prematurely given. He hadn't done anything worthy of one at that point and I don't really feel he deserves one now. Maybe he will rectify that with post presidential work.
Are we all choosing to completely forget that he had inherited an economy that had just entered a deep recession? We're also facing a more global economy that is also moving toward automation. I think we might see similar or worse growth with our new president if we don't start trying to create a new market for America to take a lead in. Factory jobs and mining won't be what fixes our economy. 
This is why minorities are so angry. When Obama was elected, there were people who lynched puppets of Obama on their front lawns. Yet acknowledging that this behavior or sentiment might be present in the base has been seen as divisive language.This behavior hasn't gone away and if anything those voices have grown stronger.
its because of retards like these author that no one takes conservatives seriously. 
Those bible thumpers told me he is a kenyan muslim and the antichrist !!!
white americans hating black americans has been the staple of American history since atleast the civil war, so no, that oft repeated bullshit line is not true. 

It's the overreactive, uneducated Americans who chose to be racist who made America a hateful place, not Obama. Obama wasn't tweeting racist reactionary bullshit, that'd be the wonderkid of the republicans and right wingers who has now become the president.
&gt; he had inherited an economy that 

LOL.  **EIGHT YEARS** of stagnation.  that's plenty of time
That must be why the left is always faking racist attacks, because it's so commonplace they have to make false claims.

The only party that preys upon the nation with identity politics is the Democratic Party.  It's no bother to me though, I actually hope you all continue with this idiotic behavior.  

You've lost every majority in the nation and you have no power.  The nation has grown tired of your dumb shit.
Objectively speaking his predecessor was equally bad. He dramatically lowered all government revenue streams and subsequently spent like a maniac, he created an entire new govt bureaucracy (DHS), allowed for the government to collect information and spy on any American they wanted, spent trillions upon trillions in a war based on falsified information where he failed to create a working Iraqi state after Saddam, his administrations lax government regulation on the financial marketplace allowed the financial markets to run out of control leading to a systemic crash, his administration allowed people to buy homes IF THEY HAD NO JOB, and he bailed out banks before bailing out the American people with tax payer dollars.
I'm not saying Bush or Obama were the worst presidents, someone below says Buchanan but could also be president Taylor.

But man, with no ability to lower taxes (as Bush cut them to a point where they could not be cut further to create economic gains) without the deficit spending in 2008 we would have been pretty fucked. Anyone with an economics background could tell you that.
Systematic racism has to actually be proven first. It's a term used, but never proven.
No. As much as I dislike him, he's nowhere near the worst president.
Be sure to keep your eyes closed. What kind of evidence would you believe? None whatsoever is my guess.
And again no example given. Thanks for proving my point.
[deleted]
I asked you what type of evidence you'd accept. You replied that I supplied no evidence. Genius. Clearly, you are unwilling to view and weigh any evidence.
No you didn't.

I made a comment, you replied saying I wouldn't accept any evidence, and that I kept my eyes closed. Even in this comment you claim the something, so how did you offer to show me?

You're just some dense guy if you can't even understand what you wrote, but I guess  you have to be that type of person if you believe things like that which don't exist int he first place.



What kind of evidence would you accept?
Creation of the term, where the creator(s) came to the conclusion of it in a fair manner. Examples of modern government policies passed, or still in effect where it favors certain citizens over others based on skin color, though Affirmative Action doesn't seem to count for some reason.
Agreed, and the article alludes to that a lot. 
What about the article is "retarded"?
Did you try and read it?

Edit: Just realized you wrote it. Lol 
That's why I asked, lol. I'm curious for feedback. :)
&gt; President Donald Trump restored the bust of Winston Churchill to the Oval Office **immediately**

as I recall, sending the gift bust back to U.K. was Obama's first act in office...you know...that nasty global imperialism image he sought to punish throughout his term
rat tat tat.  OUR President Trump will kick ass and that's for sure

unwind all things Obama.  put that super punk in his place as the most damaging, most worthless, most anti American potus of all time = his legacy of futility

WHILE charging forward with illegal immigration, border control, tax relief, energy support, deregulation, school choice and aggressively attacking all criminals

oh, also important, putting uber punks like Schumer [and the media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxMUnnuqd4s&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m15s) in their place...know by Obama as the **back of the bus**
Obama never sent it back to the UK he took it out of the oval office and put it in another part of the white house outside the treaty room. https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/07/27/fact-check-bust-winston-churchill
i c your link info.  now I wonder why Obama would let 8 years pass without denying the send back rumor if it were not true?
You are almost as incoherent as he is. Have you considered running for office? 
Probably for the same reason that Glenn Beck never denied the rumor that he raped and murdered a woman in 1990.   Sometimes the right thing to do is ignore it, especially when the rumor is trade among circles that don't like you anyway.
I don't think it's fair to lump it all on Obama.  Remember, the President is not a dictator, especially on domestic policy.  Every economic reform the Democrats have tried to pass was challenged (fiercely) by the Republicans.  If the economy has been mismanaged, we should blame instead the fierce partisanship in Congress.  The two halves of America's federal government hate each other's guts and don't want to cooperate on anything, and the country suffers for it.  Every good idea on side has is shot down by the opposite side.  I have no idea how Trump thinks he's going to fix this political culture.
People said that Obama would be the end of America, but he was just a let-down, even to his own supporters.  *I wonder what Trump will be.*
It was a ridiculous rumor. Its beneath him
Facts no need for something so trivial
Just make them alternative!
Well, it certainly didn't reflect anything positive about free carry either.
Obama's legacy? Macy's has nothing to do with Obama and everything to do with people shopping more online you nitwit. They don't need big box stores full of crap when people can just go to Amazon.com or even Macy's.com and get what they need. This isn't something that is suddenly going to stop happening under Trump, either. You can sit there and deny it all you want and connect totally unrelated things together but that doesn't make them true.
You know that putting words on top of a picture does not represent factual data, right?
So how do you tell if things are true or not, if you refuse to listen to anything the media says? Do you seriously think that Trump wouldn't lie? He's already done so numerous times. "Drain the swamp, lock her up," etc. It's not healthy to refuse to listen to any group except the one you want to believe. That's just not even being anti-fact it's being anti-reality. 
How can any self-respecting Republican support this administration? This used to be a party of values. Now, I' not so sure.....

Pretty hard for the GoP to ever take the moral high ground again
You'd think that once Obama was out of office, conservative pundits would scale back their more extreme and embarrassing trash talk.
Yes.

Next question?
I mean the policies surrounding punishment for crack cocaine vs powdered cocaine is generally accepted as one of the most glaring examples of systemic racism.

With that being said - racial divide is kind of a staple in america. The key thing though is that it isn't just whites who are racist. Minorities are racist among each other. Look at how Hollywood treats Asian-Americans in media. Look at the NBA and how that community treated Jeremy Lin's rise to stardom.

Further evidence of even more divide that has been prevalent before that? Look at the sports community and how it views gays. Look at hip hop music and how misogynistic it can be. Race, religion, sexual orientation, politics, what color you like, what band you listen to, hell even what fucking console you game on and your favorite sports teams can cause people to come to blows and acts of violence.

Divisiveness has never been more or less. It just simply exists. The difference is how the internet has given everyone a platform to voice their opinions and differences. Prior to the internet speaking about politics at the dinner table were taboo. You don't speak about it among coworkers or family simply because of its divisive nature. Same thing for religion, but now with the internet and peoples desire to voice their opinion and be heard means they are heard by anyone and everyone.

Obama made this country more divisive? No - it simply has always been divisive.
Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Franklin D. Roosevelt are the three most popular presidents among historians.
Stagnation? We went from a sharp downward spiral to a steady climb (though not as quick as our spiral was).
I think it's less that he's being punished for being conservative and more so that he's being punished for being an asshole about his conservative views. I don't know how much press his antics get outside of New England, but the guy is a royal dick with a huge victim complex. 

On the one hand, he deserves to get in the HoF due to his career. In the other hand, I don't know how much you can expect that to happen when he's seemingly spent his entire post MLB career making vicious and downright juvenile comments about anyone he disagrees with. 
More so than anything, I think it's because he's not afraid to talk shit about the media and the voters are all media. 
No wonder this sub sucks, filled with RINOS and neocons.

You can't even upvote a Patriot who is getting shafted.
don't be a donkey.  Obama was clearly the worst.  and [here's more agreement](http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/479-obama-had-lower-average-approval-rating-nixon-or-bush) coming in just today
Rush Limbaugh claims the sports "media" are even farther left than the usual lame stream "media" types
They are. ESPN fired Schilling for his political views, but have recently come out in support of the Women's March.
&gt; come out in support of the Women's March

no no no, you mean the vagina "I bleed" tampon KILL TRUMP march
many years ago, I came up with I claim is the PERFECT foreign policy and trade policy stance for America.  it's very simple and states...

**Your Policy is Our Policy**

country by country, whatever their laws/policies prescribe, USA's is exactly the same back.  you have a 30% tariff?  OK, we do too.  you demand a 90-day wait for a particular license?  OK, we do too

nothing could be more "fair" and nothing could use less ink and paper to enact.  and NOTHING any country can say in protest would make sense
What about him makes him a patriot? You voted for the same guy?
Wrong. Not why he was fired. Do your fucking research.
"The voters are all media"? Dafuq?
No thanks.
Good for you. Way to be honest about what you see. God bless 
.... that is all...
You are so fucking backwards it must hurt...
Haha
Kind of early to make such a claim... it's looking like he might be though
Buuuullshiiiiit. 6 points in 100 days? No no no. He promised over 40 things for day 1 alone. Pull your collective head out of your collective ass.
Which he didnt...
For fucks sake, where do you come up with this shit. 
Yes. The Baseball Writers of America are the people that vote players into the hall of fame, they're all (or have been) members of the media. Curt Schilling is notorious for starting shit with reporters and other members of the media, so the butthurt voters aren't voting for him. 
You're confusing two different groups. The baseball media votes on the hall, not CNN or msnbc... seriously dude, wake up
&gt; These safe spaces don't help college students grow up but more threat them like a 5 year old who needs to be pampered and protected from the outside world.

I'm not sure what's the problem with safe spaces.  Isn't a church a safe space for Christians?  If I walked into a church and started ridiculing the faithful there, I'd be rightly tossed out and everyone would be enraged.  Isn't this subreddit sort of a safe space for Republican supporters?  At least you guys don't seem as bad as r/the_donald.  There I said a few critical things about Trump in the most diplomatic way I could and got banned pretty quickly.  Stormfront.org is a safe space for white supremacists.  The Internet is a huge swamp of safe spaces.  People who complain about "political correctness" culture are in a way complaining about the lack of safe spaces for their incorrect leanings.

I think the problem is the choice of wording.  "Safe" implies the people in there are wimps.
I'm not some conspiracy loon, I'm saying the members of the baseball media don't like Curt Schilling. He's like Marshawn Lynch. And it's not like the sports media and the mainstream media are two separate entities entirely, they all belong to the same conglomerates. 
Great contribution sport.
GTFO. I'll ignore your last sentence as it was so asinine it deserves no attention. But, you're still wrong. Lynch is disliked because he never speaks to the media. Schilling is disliked because he is a grade A ass hat...
Everything you said is just bullshit... you are extraordinarily ignorant to facts, or you are still so butt hurt about having a black president, you know of no other way to lash out irrationally. You pick, sport.
He is an asshat, but he's also a hall of fame talent player that deserves to make it. Nothing he's done has damaged the integrity of the game - he didn't do steroids, he didn't bet on baseball, he didn't have any cheating scandals. The voters that aren't voting him in don't like Curt the person, not Curt the player. 
Ok, but that's not what they vote on. They vote on the whole person... you can't just choose what you think those things should be. And he's not HOF quality 
His controversial opinions don't negate the fact he won the Roberto Clemente award, the Branch Rickey award, and the Lou Gehrig award, all of which are awarded based on character. 

And his playing career is also hall of fame worthy. He won 3 World Series, made 6 all-star games, was a World Series co-MVP, and was an NLCS MVP. Not enough to make first ballot, but certainly enough to make the hall. 
Not controversial opinions. Bigoted opinions. And he scammed millions of tax payers with his bunk ass company...
Very sad. 
Only one butthurt around here is you big guy.

Enjoy 8 years of Trump and Republican control of pretty much everything.  Your dipshit ideology has been defeated.

Hahaha
Lol if you believe that for one second.
Republicans have majorities in the House, the Senate, State House Chambers, Governorships, and the presidency.  Democrats have been beaten back so bad that they are at their lowest level of power in nearly 100 years.

History has shown that after a leftist president, we as a country move to the right and elect a Republican president for 3 terms.

Those are facts, now piss off junior.
3 terms huh? Remind me when, young buck.
Carter led to 2 terms for Reagan then 1 for Bush.  Wilson led Harding then Coolidge then Hoover.

There's two examples tinkerbell.
Two examples with 45 presidents.... nice
We don't elect a lot of liberal presidents.  You're not very good at critical and logical thinking.  

Hint:  Just because we've had 45 presidents doesn't mean they were either liberal or conservative, or even Democrat or Republican.

Go away now, you've embarrassed yourself enough.  
You couldn't be more incorrect if you tried
A campaign video released two months after the election?  It's now up to Trump to silence his critics by living up to his own promises.
isn't it an absolute BLAST to watch Trump roll?

&gt; The most the Russians did was hack information and leak it. There is no evidence of direct tampering with vote totals, counting machines, or otherwise infiltrating the election. Thus, the idea that the Russian government meddled with the presidential election is dishonest. They provided materials to the public, which once upon a time was called transparency. People still had the free will to judge the materials and cast their votes how they saw fit.

Very correct, important to emphasize.  It's hard for me to condemn this when I cheered the leaks by Darby, Manning, Snowden, and whoever leaked the Panama Papers.  But I am still uncomfortable because the Russians did not have noble intentions.  Putin knows that Trump will weaken the network of alliances that has allowed America to project its power across world.

I also have to agree that there wasn't enough fuss about Saudi meddling in US administration.  With friends like these, who need enemies like Putin?
The bipartisan divide in Congress is more to blame than the President.  Trump will have no easier a time fixing the education system than Obama did.  It's not a matter of him having the balls or the brains, it's a matter of Democrat and Republican congressmen being able to agree on a plan of action.
This is the same party that tore Bill Clinton to shreds over his adultery and the Whitewater affair.  Now they stand behind a man who has committed numerous sexual assaults and some very serious financial misconduct.  The "moral majority" is neither moral nor the majority.
Careful now.  Obama supporters seemed to think Obama was the next Jesus when he was elected, but that magical aura evaporated rather quickly after he took office and he became a just-OK President.
yea yea, but the pain is finally abating and I'm entitled to rejoice

it's such a pleasure every morning rather than hearing another and another horrible thing Obama did to America
Careful now.  Obama had a magical aura about him when he won the election but that evaporated rather fast after he actually took office.  Come back in a couple of months and tell me what you think then.
Perhaps you should not restrict your media consumption to right-wing American outlets.  Try broadening your sources, if only to empathize with the other side.
oh I try, but, e.g. 10-15 minutes of CNN or MSNBC = Puke City

also, I listen to tons of radio and clips, clips galore.  I miss nothing
[removed]
Oh yeah, those are terrible.  I recommend you watch the YouTube channels of Vox, The Economist, and Seeker Daily.  They are a little more thoughtful.
not The Economist.  left wing 80% of the time
Oh, that's funny.  By European standards they lean somewhat right of center.  Still, they are a good source in they are thoughtful and non-partisan.  They're not fanatical like Fox News or Salon.com.  That they are British also helps; you get a foreign perspective.
&gt; that hundreds of public schools that received as much as $2 million dollars in federal funding to boost their test scores and increase their educational attainment levels performed no better than schools that received no new funding

same old shit from liberals.  THROW (**our**) money at the problem then shrug when nothing good happens.  no accountability.  no one gets fired.  no one gets scolded.  they just get RAISES !!!
When 70% of it is made up of minorities just do the exit polling math
I thought Obama was a sack of shit from day one.  Trump has already exceeded expectations if you're comparing him to Obama.
He's gearing up for a 2020 challenge against Trump. I'm not really a Paul fan but I would welcome the challenge as I do think he's at least (1) reasonable and rational and (2) genuinely wants to do right for the country and not just himself.
Wtf are you talking about?
Absolutely.  It feels like we have a real leader again.
This is one thing I approve with Donald Trump.  The TPP negotiations were shrouded in secrecy, and from what I've told they awarded too much power to corporations.  I think the Left should be just as pleased with this as the Right.
maybe I should give Trevor Noah a second chance that was not a bad interview at all, very fair.
The demographics of the sports community in the United States indicate they would tend to be more liberal. I think 70% of the NFL are minorities with higher numbers than that in the NBA.
Wtf does that have to do with shit??? Are you honestly suggesting minorities are keeping him out of the hall? Also, 58% of MLB players are white, and 30% lower than that is the number in the NBA. Are you throwing alternative facts?
Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  What about Saudi Arabia?  Osama bin Laden and most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi.  Saudi is the homeland of wahhabism, the extreme form of Islam that inspired al-Qaeda, ISIS, and most of the other Sunni extremist movements that are responsible for all the Islamist terrorist attacks the West has suffered.

But this won't happen because Saudi Arabia is an important ally of the US.  The US military has a lot of bases there, and many US oil companies have business interests there.
No, I was agreeing with Rush's claim that suggest that the sports community may be more far left than most groups based on its makeup. I have zero clue what their opinion of Mr. Schilling might be. I also know there were a large number of rumors that Schilling was "on the juice" during MLB's steroid era and would guess that has more to do with it than his political opinions.

Great.  China can start taking their illegals and their drugs.  Great
I don't understand why we are cheering the fact that our president is shitting all over one of our closest allies.
Our "closest ally" is in the hands of murderous cartels. Is that who you want as an ally?

They're angry because Trump plans on getting in the way the Cartels.
Your understanding of the benefits of alliances is incredibly one dimensional.
I do understand the benefits of alliances plenty.

You just need sangfroid. Negotiations are not for the weak.
Trump isn't negotiating. He's acting like a child. Why are we asking Mexico for foreign aid to build a wall on US territory? It's amateur hour in the White House right now.
Its not going to stop illegals and drugs.... We have been trying to do that for 50 years and failed. All it does is force them to adapt and find new ways to do what they were doing before.
That's a tired meme already.

Yes.
You shouldn't be. Even if you agree with the spirit of the policy, the president isn't a king. He doesn't get to sidestep the constitution with executive orders, without consulting congress. This is a striking executive power grab.
While you are correct(I personally believe it is something that should have been handled in the legislature). Where the fuck was everyone when Obama did something similar back in 2011? Nothing but crickets from the media and all the SJW's and lawyers offering up pro bono assistance you see now.  Quite a few disgustingly overlooked a bunch of shit when Obama was stomping all over the Constitution, now Trump is going to try and do the same things if he can get away with it.
[deleted]
A lot of republicans complained about Obama abusing executive powers.

Democrats protest against the policies but i haven't heard many saying that it was an abuse of presidential powers.
It simply goes too far. People with green cards or visas should be allowed in.

I agree with the refugees ban though. Opening the borders to anyone who struggle in his home country is a disasters in Europe. I prefer to help them in their own country, why aren't refugees camp a thing anymore??

It's both but one's more glaringly egregious  

Edit for the downvoters: We don't do religious tests here (by his own words). I don't care what you think of muslims, someday we're going to inevitably have a non Christian president and we'll all be glad for the fact that we don't. We don't do religious tests.

What if I told you that what he's doing is entirely within the bounds of the law as passed by Congress?


8 U.S. Code § 1182 paragraph f) states:

"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be
 detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."
You shouldn't be OK if it was actually true. Even people in /r/The_Donald were gearing up to oppose it.

But it's all fake news. 

Green card holders will be allowed back in, no judicial order was disobeyed at any point, the constitution and existing laws weren't disrespected, etc.

Trump blocked refugees into the US, but at the same time found another place for them. Saud Arabia will create safe zones for them.

It's all fine.
I really can't stand when modern Republicans try to take credit for Lincoln. 
Seriously.  This is all over-hyped and over-sensationalized.  
I'm a Republican, seriously guys, but we have to ask ourselves if we're okay with stuff Republicans do. I mean, are we even okay with stuff Obama did which was totally cool, now that it's a Republican doing it? I'm a Republican, but clearly anything Trump does is literally fascist. We, as Republicans, really have no choice but to embrace the Left's mood of the moment. 
That wasn't fake news, there was just a lot of [confusion about how to implement the executive order.](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN15D07S) Green card holders weren't initially being affected, but then a Trump official said green card holders had to check with a US consulate to see if they could return because it would be a case-by-case basis.
The ones at the airport are being detained for verification, which is a normal thing to do.

The "abrupt" part I may see as a legitimate criticism, but it was made by recommendation of career immigration officers from the DHS. They say if it's not abrupt, people that want to hurt our country will just advance the date of their travel. 
i don't even like Trump and I think you are wrong. He has yet to do anything that sidesteps the Comstitution and he has yet to do anything on which he had any duty to consult Congress.  Can you p,ease gove specific examples and reasoning for your position? Exactly what power do you think he has grabbed?
Aaaaand what if I told you, about ten years later, it no longer was within the bounds of the law?

8 U.S. Code § 1152 states: "...no person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence."

There's a reason a federal judge decided to block the order for the time being, a reason lawyers are working pro bono from inside JFK Airport to fight the executive order. There exists enough evidence to further investigate the legality.
It wasn't fake news the Trump White House did a terrible job of implementing it. There was no grace period so it went into effect immediately yet there was no clarification on what exactly it meant. The lack of information allowed people to speculate and the speculation led to what you're calling fake news. 

It is not all fine. Whether you like his policies or not you should be concerned about the lack of clarification and planning in how this order went out. 
Experienced immigration officers in the DHS recommended against a grace period. They say anyone that wants to hurt the US would just advance their trip.

The "lack of information" came from the fact that it had to be done by surprise.
The abrupt part is only part of it. It's also the conflicting stories about what the order actually meant. Abrupt is understandable but when you do something abruptly you need to have the full information ready for those who have to enforce it.
Yes, but that was at the DHS end. Not Trump's fault.
Was it a surprise to Trump and the White House staff? They shouldn't have been surprised. They should have created information that they could have sent out right away to clear up the questions.

Not doing that was sloppy and it's embarrassing and there should be no defense for that. 
They did, they were talking to the press as soon as the order went out.

I don't understand what is that you're suggesting Trump should have done differently.
Trump controls the White House website. The website had very little information about the order. Nor was there any other place for people that may be affected to get factual information. That is absolutely Trump's fault. 
No, it's the press fault for spreading false information.


You're seriously going to defend not updating the White House website or putting out factual information? 
Like I said, at a minimum they could have updated the White House web page with clarifying information about the order. If you had a green card from one of those countries and had been away on vacation when the order passed how would you know whether you could get back or not? Or what new rules you had to follow? Don't you think that should be a priority?
The directions and decision to enforce it right now didn't come from the White House. There was press releases from the DHS.
[deleted]
I don't understand why the White House, though.
The team that adds content to the white House website isn't assembled yet.
Because the White House signed the order and should have made sure the people enforcing it knew what they were enforcing.

Also, the White House is in charge of DHS. If DHS messed up then the blame still lies with the White House.

Mistakes happen but you need to accept blame when they do. 
Yes I am incredibly okay with this.

Are you guys preemptively making PR campaign images, so once Trump passes deregulations and tax cuts, you can kick him out and pretend he had nothing to do with GOP?

It's sort of transparent when you think about it. All the big donors hated Trump because they know this would happen, he is a bull in  a china shop.  Kochs even talked about supporting Hillary, but they didn't. But why? Here is my tinfoil hat theory. Donors made a deal with Trump, that they will support him in exchange for Mike Pence being VP. A guy will very different views on foreign policy, guy who openly denounced Trump. Trump would never choose him on his own. Trump wanted to even back out [at the very last moment](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-vp-offer-mike-pence_us_57894258e4b0867123e146b1).

&gt;“around midnight last night, he asked aides if he could **get out of it.**”

Get out of the deal. Pence continued to not align himself with Trumps policies on Russia and others, why? Because he doesn't have to...

I am honestly jealous, democrats are so uncrafty and toothless compared to GOP leadership.

The judge didn't black the order. It granted a stay to those who already held visas.

That's literally the judge saying, "Uh...legal status of this specific group potentially affected unclear, so previous status quo in place for them pending further review."
Giving orders that your subordinates can't swiftly enforce properly *is* your problem as the boss. I can give him some credit as being brand new that he's still learning how to communicate with these people effectively, but if they aren't ready to do what he wants now, then he could have waited a couple weeks for them to get ready before he signed the order.
It was done fast at the request of senior DHS officers. 

Trump explains it briefly in this tweet: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/826060143825666051 but there is an interview with Priebus that says it was the DHS that asked for it.
I don't mind that, if that's how they think it needs to be done. What I meant was that it could still be done quickly and suprisingly just as well in February. If DHS says, "we need to put this in place immediately once it's announced," then Trump could say, "let's do it Feb 06 if you aren't ready yet. I won't tell anyone about it before then, so it will still be a surprise then."
&gt; I won't tell anyone

This would leak.
That's kind of alarming, but I suppose that could be the reason, with the idea being that it's best to do it immediately even though we know we aren't really ready. We'll annoy a lot of people who perfectly belong in this country, but we'll maintain the secrecy we think is necessary. That makes sense, thanks.
I really can't stand it when people of any nation try to take credit for things done four generations ago.

Oh vey! 
[deleted]
No, Trump's "Muslim Ban" is clearly demonstrating that the American media is wholly unreliable. You might even say that they are FAKE.
I just destroyed you with my entirely rational conversation.  Do you feel destroyed now?
Communist BS.

See, once a mouse gets elected, he turns into a cat. That's the fundamental truth communists cannot comprehend.

The correct solution is for the mice to get their own guns and to learn how to shoot them and talk to each other about God-given rights and say things like "God gave me these rights, and no government can take them away."

And then the mice elect other people who talk like that and who go to the government to fight the government, people like Donald Trump whose primary enemies are the mass media and the people already in power. And they get rid of the people who don't talk like that and who are friends of the government, people like John McCain. And when Trump gets corrupted we vote him out and put someone else in who will fight against the government.

The writer of this article, for one, does not seem to understand the difference between **voter fraud** and **election fraud**. 

**Voter fraud** refers to fraudulent activity *by a voter*. This could mean a number of things, but the examples that immediately come to mind would be someone who is not allowed to vote doing so, or someone voting more than once.

**Election fraud** refers to fraudulent activity by someone with power over the election process. Again, there are a number of things that could fall under this term, but an example would be a vote counter purposefully smudging the results or machine tampering.

The article seems to use the term **voter fraud** to mean both, so I figured I'd clear that up first. Now let's break down the individual claims of the article.

&gt;In Florida’s Broward County, one of the swing counties, election employees were allegedly caught filling out stacks of stolen absentee ballots. This was described in a Nov. 3, 2016, affidavit filed by Chelsey Marie Smith, a former employee of the Secretary of Elections Department.

Based on the linked affidavit, the description of the article is accurate. However, this is an example of **election fraud**, not voter fraud. The article does not mention any kind of follow up, nor whether the claim was found to be true for false.

&gt;In Philadelphia, state Attorney General Bruce Beemer said his office was investigating a “pattern of voter registration irregularities” across Pennsylvania. CBS Pittsburgh reported on Nov. 4, 2016, “agents say a company called FieldWorks was paying people to register voters,” and “that company may have required workers to meet a quota.” Some of the registrations had addresses from non-existent locations, according to Republican Rep. Pat Meehan.

This would be an example of **voter fraud**. However, the source of this claim clearly states: "there is no evidence of voter fraud."

&gt;Police raided the FieldWorks offices in early November looking for documents used to “construct fraudulent voter registration forms.” The Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office suspected “tampering with public records or information,” or violations of an act regulating military and overseas ballots.

It's worth noting that the second source provided for the FieldWorks claim is a link to the same website. All this link does is say that there is an investigation, not that any wrongdoing has been found. The second source links to a CBS article which doesn't provide any additional info.

&gt;Cybersecurity company Cylance exposed a vulnerability in a Sequoia voting machine on Nov. 4, 2016, just days before the election. On its official blog, Cylance showed “how easy it is” to hack the machines and “directly manipulate the voting tallies in memory.”

This actually isn't an example of fraud at all, simply the opportunity for tampering. If this was done by a voter to vote fraudulently, it would be voter fraud. If done by a worker to smudge results, it would be election fraud. The source that the article provides on this is actually a statement on how to help prevent fraud, and includes no examples of actual wrongdoing.

&gt;In Georgia, federal officials are investigating suspicions that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hacked the state’s government network, including its election system. DHS Inspector General John Roth issued a letter on Jan. 17 asking Georgia’s secretary of state for detailed web and network logs connected to 10 separate attempts to breach the systems between February 2016 and November 2016.

The source provided by the article, the letter mentioned above, states: "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) is investigating a series of ten alleged scanning events that may have originated from DHS-affiliated IP addresses." Doesn't say it did happened, but that it was alleged to have happened. Doesn't say the source was a DHS-affiliated IP address, says it may have been. There's no mention of follow up, or whether any wrongdoing was actually found to have occurred. 

&gt;In Detroit, voting machines in more than a third of its precincts registered more votes than there were voters. The Detroit News reported on Dec. 12, 2016, that “it’s unclear how many votes were added in Detroit,” since county officials had not tabulated how much the ballots were off. Michigan is now replacing all its voting machines—a process it expects to complete by August 2018.

Considering the scale of the allegation here, this would likely be an example of **election fraud**. The source provided by the article doesn't attempt to give a reasoning for the discrepancy, however, be it human error, machine error, or fraudulent activities.

&gt;According to James Scott, senior fellow of the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, the voting systems are vulnerable enough that surface-level voter fraud is no longer necessary for someone looking to alter an election.

&gt;Considering “how vulnerable the election system is at every layer,” all you have to do is hire an insider, Scott said. “There are no background checks on election polling managers, and lots of them are hired as contractors by the actual [voting machine] manufacturers.”

&gt;“All you need to do is say, ‘I’ll give you $500, and you give me this memory card at the end of the night,'” he said. Then the insider could add simple code to alter the outcome of votes in a handful of swing counties.

&gt;Video investigations from Project Veritas have shown the willingness of many polling site workers to commit crimes, such as advising people how to perpetrate various forms of voter fraud. 

This portion doesn't actually contain an allegation of fraud, simply comments on the ease of it. The last bit about Project Veritas video isn't sourced.

&gt;Clinton could have received over 800,000 votes from non-U.S. citizens on Nov. 8, 2016, according to research from political scientist Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. Based on voting statistics, he calculated that “6.4 percent of non-citizens voted, and that of the non-citizens who voted, 81.8 percent voted for Clinton and 17.5 percent voted for Trump.” The numbers were extrapolated from a study he co-authored about the 2008 campaign.

This is an example of [b]voter fraud[/b]. However, there are two things wrong here. First, as the article claims, the numbers were extrapolated from data about the 2008 election. **It does not directly reference any numbers, statistics, facts, or data of any kind gathered from the 2016 election.** Furthermore, the source that the article links to in order to support their claim that "voter fraud in 2016 was likely" **uses this data to make the point that illegal voting did not have a significant impact on the 2016 election.** From the source: "Donald Trump recently suggested that his deficit in the popular vote to Clinton might be due entirely to illegal votes cast, for instance by non-citizens.  Is this claim plausible?  The claim Trump is making is not supported by our data."

The article posted by /u/doom_room is a hot mess.

The author does not understand the difference between voter fraud and election fraud.

The examples given by the article in order to support that claim that "evidence suggests voter fraud in the 2016 elections was likely" provide **no actual proof of wrongdoing by anyone**. The most solid claims were the ones about the stolen absentee ballots, which, according to the articles sources, has not been found to be true. The other was the one about voting machines in Detroit, which, again, according the articles sourced, has does not even claim was the result of wrongdoing by any party.

And the last one. Oh, boy, the last one. **The article either misunderstands the source provided or frames it intentionally in order to give the illusion that it supports the articles claim that voter fraud was likely, when it in fact states outright that they do not believe that voter fraud had an impact on the results of the election.**

At best, whoever wrote this article has no idea what they're talking about. At worst, the writer of the article is intentionally misframing the information provided in order to deceive their audience.
Good. Republicans deserve it! You people are the worst!

Don't throw stones when you live in a glass house 
well, I suggest Trump's investigators start in Chicago

not because we know there's tons of fraud, but because the public has been schooled in Chicago corruption for decades.  the bad news report will be easily accepted then the investigation can move to new turf like NY and CA.  getting/proving 3 million should be easy
But throw firebombs, rocks, riot, silence, kick, scream, and cry when someone you don't like gets to hold the mic. 
You lie! Remember that?
Oh yes, now I remember. Years ago, but he was indeed lying. 
Ahh, no buddy, he wasn't.
Yup! You can look it up online. 
20 fucking kids start a fire and it's suddenly burning down the whole campus? 

2000 people show up for a peaceful protest and then 20 fuckers no one knows show up and start a big bon fire and suddenly the world is at war?


You're advocating violence against political dissidents, grouping all people of an ideology into said dissidents, advocating silencing the opposition, yet you probably call Republicans fascist without seeing the irony.
Lol, this guy has obviously went waaay out into left field trying to find any reason to hate.
Nah, when bigot loud mouths run their hate and nonsense.  
I'm not sure you've ever met a bigot, boy...
The hooded kids who break windows and start fires at protests are neither republicans, not democrats. They're people who specifically seek protests, no matter what cause it supports, to conduct vandalism.

So I wouldn't be drawing conclusions one way or the other. The only strange thing is why weren't they arrested, it was full of cops there, and they were visually distinct with those black "burka" style disguise.
On Breitbart?
Most news sites covered it. 
&gt; When did Democrats decide that it was time to partake in the tactics they once criticized? 

When it was shown that those tactics worked.

Both sides are hypocrites on this one. Mitch McConnell said he's had enough with obstruction today. Dude invented obstruction. 
Boy? Who you calling boy, son! I've met plenty of bigots. None of them successful, all stupid 
You gotta fight hate with hate. Need a safe space bro? 


I'm advocating violence against right-wing terrorist

"lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing violent right-wing extremist ideology are the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the United States.”

-the FBI
same old troll FYI TRUMP IS PRESIDENT! 
Actually, most legitimate news sites claim he didn't. Breitbart, the Blaze, etc all claim he did. I doubt you even know what the issue in question was.
You literally said "Republicans deserve it" not "right wing terrorists deserve it." Not to mention that all of the biggest terror attacks have been caused by Islamic Extremists.
Right wing terrorist, republicans, same difference.

Islamic Extremists, Muslims, same difference. 
Fair enough

Sooo, the "proof" the story was fake is a public statement from Mexico which did not entirely contradict the news story and a shovel full of doubt? Not buying it. I'm sure, if the story really is fake, Donnie will have no trouble releasing a recording of the conversation.
It did entirely contradict the story.  Mexico called it absolutely false and a lie.  Someone told the AP trump threatened war against Mexico, and every reliable source confirms it was a lie.  But if you hate Trump who cares about tlfacys, right?
If I was the president of Mexico and if Trump, commander in chief of the most powerful military force in history, threatened to use that military against me and my people then I would be screaming it as loud as I can at anybody who would listen to desparately get any outside support. Seriously why would the Mexican government defend Trump if he said this to them? 
Who knows. I just think it's too easy for the White House to prove critics wrong to the point the fact it hasn't speaks volumes.
Do you have a link to the original statement from Mexico? Without it I don't know if the author pulled this out of the air.

&gt; Liberals opposed war under former President George W. Bush

nope.  fake.  Google says...

"Handing Bush a major victory, the Democratic-led Senate voted 77-23 for a war powers resolution negotiated between the White House and congressional leaders backing a possible use of force to rid Iraq of suspected weapons of mass destruction and possibly oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein."
But your claim does not make logical sense, I simply cannot believe that the Mexican Government would just lie down and take something like that quietly, and since you have no evidence I am thus dismissing your concerns
By 2009, my grandfather was the only member of my extended family to still have a newspaper subscription, and that was mostly because he used newspapers as packing material and animal bedding. 

He died in 2015, and his subscription died with him.  None of his kids, grandkids, or great grandkids have newspaper subscriptions. 

"Profitability" does not imply utility. The yellow pages are incredibly profitable. Yet, virtually all copies end up in the trash without ever having been opened, or even being removed from their plastic wrapper.

probably POWER intoxication, knowing millions are watching while they are paid millions, e.g. Meg Kelly, total slut, will say whatever for ratings.  she's on tape saying such

The article says it right there word for word... Milo (and Trump) are professional political trolls.

Yep, they bought into the "weapons of mass destruction" bullshit same as everyone else.
You can't "bully" a corporation, that's stupid. That's what the free market is, influencing businesses by choosing whether or not to buy their product.
[deleted]
The article was about bullying a CEO, not the corporation itself.
[removed]
&gt; Uber was bullied because they were willing to serve customers instead of take out their rage on regular Americans

Sounds like bullying the corporation itself.

Since it's a crap article that doesn't actually say how anyone was actually "bullied" we could be forgiven for not knowing what they're really talking about.
Well that article ended abruptly. More analysis?
LOL.   I think it was just summing up how bad the situation is for Dems
It's bad, and if Hillary had won the election the Republican Party would have become a minority because of the massive amounts of immigrants that would have been brought in, and would have all votes democrat 
I really just think gerrymandering of district lines, poorly functioning educational system, isolationism in rural districts, and the perpetuation of "alternative facts" are the cause of the republican rise. My mom always said "if you ain't cheatin' you ain't tryin'."
I rally doubt that Democratic Party will become a minority. Basically more than half of voters voted for Hillary which means there are still many democrats.
The article mentions Gorsuch as being a shoe-in due to the rules changes requiring only a simple majority on nominations. But the article it linked to as a source mentions that SCOTUS nominations are excluded from the rule. 

I lose trust for articles that fail to properly back up their claims.

I think he meant to say that more voters voted for the democratic candidate that the republican candidate. If you look at just votes cast for those two parties, it's over half.
I'd love to be a fly on the wall for that.

Can you fill me in? I'm still unsure. 
Except the "writer" answered you. Take it as you will. 
You're right, I hadn't noticed that OP was the actual author of the piece, thank you.

I stand by my point though. If your goal is to imply that the CEO of a company was bullied and *not* the company itself, you shouldn't say things like "Uber was bullied".

If you want to imply that the CEO himself was bullied, you should include something about how he was personally intimidated or blackmailed or whatever, and by whom.  If he's "trying to save his company", well, that's his *job* that he's *paid to do*, which is pretty much the opposite of being bullied.

If it *were* possible to "bully" a corporation, I would be more inclined to think that the President of the United States, in his official capacity, using his official POTUS Twitter account, attacking Nordstroms for not carrying his daughter's stuff, would be "bullying" a corporation.
That's ... wow.. jaw dropping.  Hypocrisy in ways I just can't explain. 
Disturbing.  I come from Europe, and street brawls between far-left and far-right gangs are not uncommon.  I mean, it's nowhere as near as crazy as it was 50 or 80 years ago but it's still an issue.  We Europeans actually admire American politics for their relative civility.  We are in despair that your people are starting to resemble us.  You have already elected the American equivalent of Silvio Berlusconi as your head of state.  Now your left-wingers, once widely admired for their dedication to non-violent protest, are turning militant.
Obama, Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton, Schumer are very obviously talking about **illegal immigration** in those clips.

Trump's executive order affected **legal immigrants** with visas, green cards, and **refugees**, which have a different status than illegal immigrants.

I mean, I'm all for exposing Democrat hypocrisy, but this video isn't even trying. If we'll be calling refugees, and people with visas and fucking green cards "illegal immigrants" then *who remains a legal immigrant*?
I see the whole political echo chamber happening amongst my peers at school and my friends; I definitely agree that exists. But the same could be said for both ends of the political spectrum, and for anyone in general: people don't like listening to things they don't particularly care for. On top of that, people tend to gravitate towards those they find common ground with, whether that common ground is socioeconomic status, video games, sports, etc. This is by no means a defense for echo chambers so much as one explanation as to why they exist.

However, I don't think Milo shatters liberal stereotypes at all as the title of the article states. He is a public figure and identifies with the alt right, which has shown its members time and again to be very politically and socially conservative people that strongly support policies that benefit, for lack of a better description, white people. He just happens to like men.

Personally, I can't really see anything that would tie him to liberal politics aside from a potential personal interest in gay marriage, but even that one seems out of character. Of course, one must remember that all public figures are "characters" and have a different lifestyle that the public probably won't hear about unless it's some kind of leaked scandal, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
A lot of people were saying the same thing about the Republican party just 4 years ago.

Trump won with LESS votes than Romney in 2012.  Anyone with a hint of charisma probably would have taken it.  Or about 20k more dead people in the right places.
finally.  thank goodness.  now, on to borders, aliens and American safety
Yeah it really feels like everything is just falling apart, the truth doesn't matter anymore, non-violent protests get made fun of and called un-American violent rioting is happening. Feelsscaryman 
This a real tragedy. 
What?
Why are you here?  Don't you have like over 400 anti-anything Republican subreddits you can be applauded for being an ignorant uninformed and easily fooled twat at?  
Republicans have majorities in the House, the Senate, an overwhelming majority of State House Chambers, all but 17 governorships, and the presidency.  

You're already a minority party.
And the fact that they try to take away our free speech if we don't agree with them. Dangerous thinking
Uninformed? Have you looked into Jeff Sessions past? He wasn't appointment before because of his racist leanings. He supports voter suppression and works to weaken civil rights. He blindly support what're Trump says. Trump cabinet is riddled people like him that BARLEY get confirmation.
Jeff Sessions has a history of racial biases. Furthermore he pushed for voter suppression, gerrymandering voting districts, and will push to weaken civil rights protections. He was also previously denied federal judgeship over accusations of racism. Which to me is a big red flag.
This is not a comeback argument. There are no facts her and you only tried to belittle squirleystew2016.
There is literally more evidence tying Hillary to pizza gate then there is to prove Sessions is some kind of minority lynching kkk member.  You guys just believe what the liberal echo chamber tells you to believe.
You're referencing Bengazi? What about Trumps failed raid that left civilians dead? Why are you not up in arms now? Also, republicans wanted Hillary's head for that, so why not be against Session for his civil rights issues. 

Liberal echo chamber? Not me. I just think critically about the information presented and there are FAR better choices than Jeff Sessions for attorney general. He's not even a good choice. I'd love to see anyone in any political party be somewhat moderate. We have two extremes competing right now. 
I'm sure the GOP in Congress already have a plan to impeach Trump. They know that he's no more fit for the WH than the orangutan at the zoo.

Mike Pence is the president they really want. And WHEN (not IF) Trump is impeached, his crazy cabinet picks are gone, too.

NO, I didn't feel that way at all
My thoughts exactly. 
&gt; Betteridge's law of headlines: Any headline in the form of a question can be answered with the word no.

I watched a video recently called "Does Donald Trump Know How to Read?". If we apply Betteridge's law, we must arrive at a curious conclusion.

I guess a more useful generalization is "any headline in the form of a yes/no question can be answered with the more boring of the two".

Lawsuits that break up the Gerrymandered districts is a good start.

This sounds like a talking point as opposed to something that would've actually happened, just like conservatives swore up and down that Obama was "taking our guns." 
you can't get that kind of answer on Fake News CNN
Fair point.
Hey, I'm all for annexing Mexico. We get a defensible southern border, some great vacation spots, and we can actually get something done in the war on drugs. Win-Win-Win.
What was his evidence? 

He said that there were academic studies done on voter fraud, but didn't name the study. 

He said go talk to people in NH, which is not evidence.

He said that the president thinks it's the truth, which again isn't evidence. 

He made a lot of statements that he didn't back up with any evidence. 
Yeah I'm confused what you mean by "several points of evidence." He made a bunch of assertions without any sources besides "people he knows in New Hampshire..."

So the secret cabal "sabotaged" Trump by... revealing that Flynn is lying to Trump and Pence?

It's not like they made Flynn lie, he decided to do that all on his own.


[Well maybe if he came into office with his own appointees...](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/408c9dc74e9646a89c20d2cf1af7a097/day-inauguration-state-department-lacks-interim-boss)
The Washington Free Beacon publishes information that cannot be validated and that is anti scientific fact. The information provided should be regarded as speculative opinion or propaganda and cannot be substantiated by fact or evidence. It is among the most untrustworthy sources in the media.
Threats of violence are not protected. Regardless, nobody is trying to arrest him for being a bigoted zealot which, under the right circumstances, could be possible. Incarceration is the consequence of unprotected speech, not being fired from at will employment. The school has every right in the world to fire someone for saying something violent. That does not violate free speech even remotely. 

This guy teaches children?
LPT: when an "article" uses the word cabal in a headline, you can safely assume it's probably bullshit. 
Apparently anyone can. 
How? 
[deleted]
In what way?
"Obama loyalist"?  Obama is a has-been.  He's going into semi-retirement like every ex-President before him.  It's not like the one true king of America is going to make a triumphant return to the throne once his loyalists depose the usurper Trump.  Does the writer of this article really mean "liberal saboteurs"?  How about "Trotskyites"?  If officials are trying to sabotage Trump, it's probably because they are just pissed with Trump's management, which isn't at all a fucking surprise since we're talking about the CEO of the Taj Mahal Casino and Trump University.
Flynn was a Trump appointee.  He was fired by the Obama administration in 2014, has been doing private intelligence analyst work contracting for Turkey and Russia Today since then.
How so?  I don't see any truth in this article at all.
to journalists?  didn't see any
[deleted]
Yes, I know. But the leaks didn't come from Flynn. I'm gonna take a wild guess and say they may be coming from the Obama appointees.
I see the pizza emoji, but we're not that desperate that we'll be arbitrarily linking every news about child abuse in the next few years to Pizzagate, right?
We have the_donald for that.
and r/conspiracy 

and r/conservative 

And voat. Keep this shit away from here. 
I bet most of the trump supporters who purchased her album didn't even listen to it.  
PizzaGate never was about Comet. Its about Elite Pedo Networks that have run unabated in the highest circles of societies internationally for decades. 
Keep this real news about pedo networks getting shut down out of here because it offends you? Fuck off and get ready for more.
If it's not about Comet, then it's not about Podesta, it's not about the Democratic party, and so essentially what is it about? It means the video linked here is not relevant to /r/republicans at all IMHO. It is about alleged criminal activity, committed by civilians. Hopefully they receive their swift justice, but this has nothing to do with either party, in particular.
1st) I'm not offended. You on the other hand seem pretty upset. 2nd) it's not the news that bother me, it's your implication that Hillary Clinton was running an international child trafficking organization from the basement of Planet Ping Pong. A building that FYI has no basement. Pizzagate is a fucking dumb conspiracy theory.

Previous presidents at least pretended as if they're in favor of a two-state solution. Trump doesn't pretend, he just doesn't care. What the effect will be of this... I can't quite say.

The way Trump talks about it, honestly I'm unsure if he understand the difference.
Trump is domineering and I suspect that he'll get fed up with the opposition to his domestic reforms and turn his attentions to foreign policy, especially military policy.  The executive branch has far more discretion when it comes to foreign policy, especially the military.  He will build his legacy going after "terrorists".
President Donald Trump discussed golfing with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and criticized Barack Obama for preferring golfing with friends rather than world leaders. When asked by journalist about the leakers involved with Michael Flynn's resignation President Donald Trump warned "we will find the leakers" and "they're going to pay a big price for leaking."
YouTube description: 

President Donald Trump answered a CNN reporter who asked why  they're have been called fake news. President Donald Trump explains brilliantly exactly why CNN earned the "Fake News" moniker and concluded it's too late for them to earn back the public's trust.

I wonder how Trump intends to remove 1/8th of the population of a red state like Texas.

whoa hey second amendment so.

Brandishing, terroristic threats, destruction of private property, public disturbance. None of those are protected under the second amendment. This guy is a clown committing crimes, and he filmed himself doing it.
He's exercising his rights therefore he's a patriot.  What the fuck do you have against gun owners?
You're obviously trolling, but for anyone reading the comment train that is confused, the right to bear arms doesn't allow you to do whatever you want with them.

Brandishing is illegal. Brandishing is the act of presenting a firearm in a threatening manner to a person who is not a threat. If someone brandishes their firearm, they are breaking the law and the act of doing so is not protected under the second amendment.

After brandishing, he proceeds to threaten the man while brandishing. That is a terroristic threat of violence. The right to bear arms doesn't allow you to threaten others with violence.

He then proceeds to walk over to this mans truck and vandalize private property. The right to bear arms obviously doesn't allow you to vandalize private property.

You're attempting to parody and demonize gun owners by touting this assclown as an example of your typical gun owner. The man taking the video is filming himself committing crimes and is obviously not responsible enough to own firearms, and is in no way representative of actual legal gun owners who don't run around breaking the law.
he wasn't brandishing or threatening, he was just showing off a neat toy.  stop trying to pretend gun owners are violent MANIACS just because they sleep with/kiss their guns
I know you're entrenched in your anti gun position, but advocating for terroristic threats and violence to support your narrative is a disgusting position to take. You need to do some serious personal reflection and realize what lengths you're willing to go to, and what terrible things you're going to allow yourself to support in order to try and support your positions.
Did I miss where he said he was a liberal democrat? Or are we just assuming that's how he identifies himself?
Someone sounds scared of an inanimate object.

It's kind of shocking how petty and stupid some of our children's teachers are. 
As a European, signs of dysfunction in the US Executive Branch are very troubling. Europe is overly dependent on America for its security. Trump promised that he would do a better job fighting terrorists than Obama did (which is a stretch because we considered Obama to be a very aggressive President; his Nobel Peace Prize is a farce in retrospect), but Trump seems to be at war with the very institutions that do most of the important work in fighting terrorism: America's cops and spies.

I mean, the question is not incorrect.
Right?

What has happened to the Republican party?
one stat I like is Hillary voters (or, anti Trump voters) live in only 15% of the land area of America.  NYC is part of that 15%
Remember when Republicans were big on "No taxation without representation"?

Be a real shame if all those sanctuary cities stopped paying out and the fed had to cut back on the military, huh? =3

Trump refuses to criticize white supremacists though, nor does he seem eager to condemn blatant anti-semitism. In fact he was incredibly disrespectful to that jewish reporter asking about anti-semitic incidents in the US.

So he appears to be playing a tightrope game, of showing support to Israel (appeals to his evangelical base) but refusing to criticize anti-semitism and occasionally creepy anti-jew messages (appeals to his racist base).
this is just a casual jab...but that dude has the handwriting of an 11 year old

I had better handwriting when I was 11 than now as an adult, so not sure if a compliment or a jab.

Yo, I doubt that is Marine One... Notice the skids on the bottom of the helicopter, all the current ones used by HMX-1 (the marine squadron responsible for VIP and presidential transport duties) For actual transport duties, lack them.  They may have some UH-1s in their squadron for support duties, but using one to transport is highly unlikely.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a victim of genital mutilation and sharia law was harassed on Twitter by Women's March Leader Linda Sarsour. Linda Sarsour said she wanted to whip Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and remove her body parts for condemning sharia law. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, author, and former Dutch politician. She is an opponent of female genital mutilation, and a real feminist.

Award Winning CBS reporter Ben Swann wants PizzaGate to be taken seriously. He’s calling for a full investigation and wonders "why hasn't any of this been investigated by law enforcement". Ben Swann’s call for action contradicts feverish reports that have failed to debunk allegations. After becoming Elite Pedo Network’s public enemy #1 Ben Swann vanished. His Facebook &amp; Twitter account were deleted, and his video was removed from all of CBS related websites. Most Americans agree Ben Swann is brave and selfless, but for the children who literally can't speak for themselves he is a hero beyond our comprehension. 

I am more concerned about real scandals like RussiaGate than imaginary nonsense like PizzaGate. Having a president who is a compromised asset of the russian dictatorship is a huge problem, and deserves infinitely more of our attention that fake scandals.

The authoritarianism and the killing of political dissidents and critics. The expansionism and imperialism. 
&gt; While conservatives have generally labeled the mainstream media as a left-leaning propaganda machine, there has been a renewed reevaluation of the networks and the journalists that the country relies on to bring us the news.

Fox News is mainstream.  They like to portray themselves as underdogs, but they get more viewers than any other network. [They've been the top news network for 15 years](http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/01/31/fox-news-channel-marks-ratings-milestone.html).  It's so laughable it's a little revolting.

&gt; A review of media coverage in the last year makes one thing clear: the networks are no friend of the Right.

Fox News is a friend of the Right.  It is the only friend among the TV networks, but it's a **big** network.  There are some others like One America News, but they're really small.  Fox News has really cornered the market; I guess conservative viewers don't crave variety.

&gt; The mainstream media does appear to be more concerned with being first than being right, which seems to be occurring more as outlets shift away from print. 

This actually began with the rise of 24/7 news channels like CNN and Fox News.  They have to pad out their airtime so they pay too much attention to trivial information, and being first with a story attracts viewers because viewers like getting information sooner, all other things being equal.  Newspapers could only deliver new information in the morning, so newspaper journalists had time to research stories more carefully.

&gt; The mainstream media has a responsibility to do a thorough, respectable job of presenting the news objectively – they have also failed at this responsibility. Does this make them the enemy of the people? It’s a complicated question, but they certainly are not an ally of the people.

All the the news networks in America are privately owned so they have to tell their viewers what they want to hear in order to stay in business.  They may be irresponsible allies, but they are still their viewers' allies.
&gt; However, the question still remains: is the mainstream media an enemy of the American people?

Yup.  Affirmative.  Yes.  Confirmed.  No Doubt
It's not like the government went there and told them to fire Milo. That's all private business of the parties involved.
Milo has the freedom to say whatever he wants.  Nobody is under any obligation to listen, print, broadcast, or otherwise give him a platform to amplify whatever it is he is saying.
I am not a big fan of his but I feel that he has some great points every now and then. 
Milo has good political points but what was said during that interview was iffy in regard to his beliefs. He willingly resigned from Breitbart in order to basically help a friend who has stuck behind him in the past - saving them some controversy.

He can still say whatever he pleases.
Milo is a gay version of Roosh V. Fucking asshole.

Every article on the Web about this story just links back to the Daily Caller. The Daily Caller is not trustworthy. However, they do quote a senior official from Indiana, which would be a ballsy lie if this is fake news. I will hold out for an official press release from the Indiana state government. 
Here is the actual letter.

I need more than accusations. Any actual proof?
I meant an official statement coming from the government's official website.  Such an accusation is very serious.  This letter from Scribd could have been forged, or it might mean something more innocuous.
The OP, u/xka_jba, is just 12 days old on Reddit, and all his activity has been posting links to news articles from the Web.  He has made no comments anywhere, not even in his own threads.
Sure, this is all one big conspiracy.

They are quite ambiguous as to what the attack is. It's referred to as a 'scanning attack' which sounds like it could be 'port scanning'. Port scanning is not hacking a network, it's seeing what ports are accessible for communication. It would require an additional step of trying to run an exploit on those ports to actually be hacking.

The is the Internet equivalent of driving down the street and noticing someone's door is open.

I'd be interested to know if there was an actual intrusion or more info on what was done.
It might not be.  But this sounds like explosive stuff so I wonder why I don't see this story reported on other websites.  Every article on the web on this story links back to the Daily Caller, which is a huge red flag when it comes to detecting fake news.
Trying to keep up appearances, no doubt.  Let's look at what happens, not what they say.  Some intel officials have leaked embarrassing information on the President.  This is something that hasn't happened to previous administrations, at least not so soon into the first term.  Trump's supporters blame this on "Obama loyalists", but usually when the intelligence community has problems with the White House they are operational in nature, not ideological.
Click bait website.
One which links to the Daily Caller, another untrustworthy site.  Even if this story is true, it could just be them trying to keep up appearances.  What we know is that some officials in the security services tried to compromise the President, something that has not happened before to previous Presidents, at least not so soon.

two places:  1. fake news, 2. DNC crap
It's not true guys, reddit already proved the guy that started this whole discussion was a swedish criminal
This survey is so flawed. Did president Trump make it himself? The whole time I was reading it I was thinking, this seems like it should be written in crayon. Was it written by an elementary school student? Even the section that is supposed to allow multiple answers doesn't function as intended. Half assed attempt to do some fund raising. Nice
I watch and listen to a lot of news. A LOT!. Way too much in fact. I consume news from CNN, MSNBC, Fox, New York Times, Washington Post, and on, and on. 

The problem isn't that the MSM is bad. It's really not. The problem is that too many people get their news from one source, or one "brand" of news. If you watch Fox, you might also watch The Blaze, or read Breitbart, or  Drudge. If you watch CNN then you maybe also watch MSNBC or the New York Times. People get siloed in their media consumption and it skews their view. 

Break the Confirmation Bias. Read something that you disagree with. Watch something new. Talk to other people w/o judging them. 

From my perspective, News is useful if it reflects verifiable facts. Too often I get more verifiable data from what people call MSM. I get opinions from conservative news. 

Feelings don't equal facts. If you cannot report facts with data, then it isn't "News". 
&gt; I consume news from CNN, MSNBC, Fox, New York Times, Washington Post, and on, and on.

those are **ALL** the fake news gin mills.  you are watching/consuming basically **NO** news
Really? All of them? 
I'm getting zero news? 
Sounds like you're an expert in news. 
Please, What news should I be consuming? 

The MSM is problematic, that's why you need to diversify, but calling it "The Enemy of the People", Sorry. I just cannot accept that. 

Edit: Added stuff.
I'm a conservative republican, and I don't trust Fox either. They are horrible big-government shills. It's very hard to get a good libertarian viewpoint there.
You can go directly to the source. Read the press releases for yourself. Read his tweets and listen to his speeches yourself.

There is literally no utility for news in the modern internet society. The fact we are not willing to pay for it is clear evidence of this.
Dude, everything the democrats do is racist. They are still bitter over the fact that they lost the Civil War and the fight for civil rights.

They need a poor, uneducated, non-citizen class to change their underwear and butter their bread. They are that pathetic.

I'm glad this woman is starting to see the truth here. Democrats need slaves, but they are just called "illegal immigrants" today. I'm sorry, "undocumented workers", meaning if their employers kill them, there is no paper trail.
[stupid](http://www.aei.org/publication/poll-13-of-syrian-refugees-are-isis-sympathizers/)
&gt; I'm getting zero news?

when I click, e.g. MSNBC, I am shocked at what is being peddled as news/truth.  a diet of that will make a person crazy, literally.  Democrats acting like lunatics post election is a major indicator
Wtf is this?
leaked video from 2008 of Obama showing off his erection to a plane full of female reporters... who apparently had his back because this didn't leak till years later. Imagine how much stuff they kept hidden.... BUT HE SOUNDED SO PRESIDENTIAL!

WHERE IS THE WOMENS MARCH FOR THIS?
What makes you think it was his erection? 


The protests sure are fighting for that old establishment.
So I'm supposed to allow the president to be the arbitrator of facts? 

Is that during all administrations or just this one? That truly sounds like a bad idea. We need independent journalists. We need a well educated, and informed electorate. 

Anybody who would tell you differently is playing a dangerous game.
Christ, you can't STILL be trying to blame Obama can you? It's time to take credit for your own admin's action Donnie.
geez.  Republicans are like clueless children.  they're so used to being the minority party, they have no idea how to lead and get legislation done

if Harry Reid or most any democrat had the same votes/tools, this would be DONE !!!  dems don't screw around, they just JAM it

thank GOD for an adult in the room // Trump
Everything on this sub is wildly inaccurate.....
Well that's not very definitive. 

You said that mainstream media an enemy of the American people. 
You also said that all the major news organizations are fake news gin mills. and providing me no news. 

In response to my question as to what news I should be consuming you provide alternatives and no facts to backup your claims. 
The behavior of Democrats has nothing to do with this discussion. Republican Tea Party activists behaved in a very similar way after Obama won, and even if they didn't it has nothing to do with the reliability or utility of a well rounded news diet. 

So unless you can present a better option, I guess I'm stuck with the one that I have, no matter how imperfect it may be. 

I worry about anyone, particularly an elected official,  who would tell me to stop paying attention to the news. 
It reminds me of the Wizard of Oz, "Pay No Attention To That Man Behind The Curtain."

The fuck? He put his foot up and rested his arm on his knee? For 7 seconds...

I have no idea how this video of a guy on a phone resting his arm on his knee somehow is proof that he has an erection AND is showing it off to all of the women on the plane (when the majority of the people in the video are facing the other direction).
Obama is the new Trotsky. 
How can anyone believe a word this guy says?
Is this sarcasm due to how The Obama administration blamed Bush for practically all 8 years?
What? Obama blamed Bush for inheriting a very expensive war, and a global financial crisis. Everything else he blamed on Republicans 
I'm sure he will eventually provide the evidence for this, just like he did with Hillary's general election fraud and about Obama being born in Kenya. 
Trump is blaming Obama for 4.5% unemployment. 
10%*

Lowest labor participation, highest number of people on government assistance in generations. 
I don't mind trump blaming Obama for the mess that he has inherited.. yet. If he keeps doing it after a month or so, then it's time to move on.
Republicans are inherently uncomfortable making tons of laws out of thin air. 
you cant see the outline?
repeal and replace is pretty simple

didn't they pass repeal like 56 times?  OK, pass it again.  replace, I've heard several VERY SIMPLE plans that would implement in a matter of days and could be written on two pieces of paper.  no more excuses.  I hope Trump pressurizes the do-nothing majority tonight.  we'll see
We're not supposed to trust anyone to be the arbiter of facts. We're supposed to see the evidence for ourselves and make our own decisions like big boys.
These numbers have to be taken in context. Yes the labor participation rate is low, but that's because the labor statistics include youth starting at the age of 16 and retired people. The baby-boomers are retiring now. Of course this number is high. This must be taken into account. 
[Labor data](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000)

Highest number of people on government assistance, is that including the elderly or disabled? I would love to see your data on that, and I would love a robust discussion on the "why" of it.

You cannot say 10% when these are the agreed metrics for years. If we want to change the metrics then that's fine but using certain metrics with one administration, and a completely different set of metrics for another doesn't seem right. 
What mess? Low unemployment rate? 
Months and months of strong job growth
7 years of modest but consistent GDP growth?
President Trump keeps saying that he inherited a mess, but I don't see it. 

[Link](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/obamas-economic-record-an-assessment)
Obama appointees like Sally Yates have been undermining the Executive branch from within. It's very possible that the leaking and undermining is part of an organized Democratic strategy to "resist" Trump.
People believe what fits their narrative. 
They get offended by this, but "Grab'em by the pussy" is just locker-room talk. 
They need all Republicans and 8 Democrats to repeal it. Won't happen. 
&gt; They need all Republicans and 8 Democrats to repeal it

incorrect.  Obamacare was passed without a single **R** vote and 51 yes votes.  same "reconciliation" tactic is totally available to this Congress...**IF** they get to work !!!

besides, Obamacare is already collapsed.  is there like two insurance companies left?
Senate rules were changed by Dirty Harry. Need 60 votes. 
This is funny. 

Too often problems are a lot more complex than we think. One chamber of congress voted 56 times to repeal it. Nothing to replace it with. The replace is hard. A lot harder than two pieces of paper.

The problem is that Obamacare is a republican idea. Obama stole it and republicans spent 7 years dumping on it. Now they need to find another idea to do what their original idea did, but not be the same idea. 

Good luck with that. 
&gt; The problem is that Obamacare is a republican idea

and all this time I thought [Hillary Clinton started it](https://www.google.com/#q=hillarycare&amp;*) when her Bill Bob Boy was pres.  and was crushed.  amazing how a man can be lead astray
the rules REMAIN changed
Baby boomers are leaving the work force in record numbers! I know, it is kind of scary, but maybe that isn't Obama's fault. And they aren't dying fast enough! Holy crap, thanks Obama! I think Trump will try and fix that problem with his health care reforms. 

Then there is the record number of people on welfare! Shit, that sucks. Oh, and the USA population is at a record number also! WTF, are these numbers related? Obama really screwed things up. The horror!
But he lies! 

The evidence that I see is that President Trump lies at a greater rate than any other president ever. He lies, and I'm supposed to go to him as a source? They are his press releases. They are his tweets and speeches. Listening only to him is like never reading product reviews, never reading independent research, never asking the opinion of a trusted confidant. 

How will I know if he's telling the truth if I never read anything but what he tells me?

I am making my own decision, but I'm making my decision on a whole host of information, not a single source. 

What you're proposing makes no sense.

How do you catch someone in a lie?

You investigate their claims.

In the internet age, it's trivial to find the reports or data yourself. There is literally no need for it to be trickled down to us by so-called reporters.
You're right. And I could assemble my own car out of parts at the junk yard and a Youtube video.

It's a dumb way to do it. I don't have the knowledge, time, historical background or mechanical inclination to do it reliably, but I suppose I could do it. 

Reporters are important. They are so important their role in the government comes as part of the first amendment to the constitution. They are an integral part of the checks and balances. You may find them quaint, but I don't. I want them harassing every administration. I want them devoting hundreds of thousands of man hours every week to pushing back to unchecked power. You may think it's a small thing to disparage them, but I see their role as vital. 

You don't agree? Fine. 
Two very expensive wars. 
When I find a reporter without an agenda who is trustworthy, I'll listen to him. Until then, I have been lied to so many times by so many so-called reporters hiding behind "Freedom of the Press!" that I have lost all hope.

Even the Wall Street Journal is running around calling Pewdiepie racist and other nonsense, when it's clear that he's not.
I read the article and those are 7 solid points, but Trump is still inheriting an economy that's growing. 

This author (who isn't an economist) found 7 points of criticism, and I guess that's fair, but if President Trump is getting an economy of 

* 80 months of job growth
* an unemployment rate of 4.6 percent
* wage growth running ahead of inflation (this is something new, I believe wage growth just started to turn around)
* and consumer confidence at it's highest point in a decade. 

And he's calling this a mess? What would he have called the economy that Obama inherited? Can't we at least acknowledge that we're headed in the right direction? Put partisanship aside, isn't there something to build on here?

BTW, What did congress do for us over the past 8 years? Was there some landmark jobs bill that I missed? Did they propose spending on infrastructure to bring some jobs back? We get so caught up on what the president does, but congress seems to be conspicuously absent during our time of crisis. 
Some of the crap that he pulled deserves to be called out. He tried to be sensational and controversial. He flew too close to the sun and got burned. 

You're swearing off news and journalism because of their coverage of Pewdiepie? Seems like an odd hill to die on. 


Good luck. 
That was universal health care through a public program like Medicaid.  What democrats originally proposed was much closer to Hillarycare but Joe Lieberman consider the public options a nonstarter so it was removed and reworked.  The final product is much closer to what John McCain campaigned for in 2008 and the heritage foundation plan.  But since it was passed along party lines it's hard to call it a republican plan.  
Ramp up the brightness, fullscreen, and listen to the comments... its pretty clear
Ramp up the brightness, full screen and listen to the comments... 
So Trump expects the Democrats to come together with Republicans?  The Republicans refused to come together with Obama, so I doubt the Democrats will feel like doing that.
Donald Trump honored Carryn Owens, wife of a slain Navy SEAL during his speech before Congress. CNN's Van Jones described the moment as one the most important in political history and sealed Donald Trump's legitimacy as President of The United States. He went on to admit if Donald Trump continues to behave this way he will win the 2020 presidential election.
c'mon man.  Obama said the **B** word a thousand times 
you don't REALLY believe that number do you?

94 million Americans are jobless

the highest poverty rate in decades

the highest food stamp rate in decades (if not all time)
I have never cared what disgraced Obama era energy czar with ties to communism has said. He is desperately trying to be on the right side of history. If it wasn't a well received speech he would be saying "See, I told you. Remember when I said this election was a whitelash (against a white candidate)?
&gt; 94 million are jobless

44.1 million are retired, 15.4 million are disabled, 12.9 million are taking care of a family member and another 15.5 million are in college or job training. They are listed as not wanting a job.

Seriously, are you going to blame Obama for people retiring and people going to school? My wife doesn't have (or want) a job right now since we just had a kid, is she a part of your claim? Thank Obama, all your fault! And when did republicans become anti family?

Poverty rates:

I don't see a problem, it seems to be in recovery (look how the lines are moving). 

Whenever is guy talk, he spews lies, he makes Hillary look like a paragon of virtue and that is saying a lot. Whether you are a republican or democrat, honesty should matter. Thankfully, everyone is fact checking him these days, he can't lie without 20 articles in newspapers describing in intricate detail how he is lying, with number and sources that Trump would never dare provide himself. At the end of this four years, if he makes it that far, I'm sure even you will be tired of this. 

Good day!

So if it was good he would say it's good, and if it was bad he would say it's bad? 
Or maybe, when everyone around you says you're an ass, and they don't feel any loyalty to you, maybe the problem is you (or in this case Him). 

Maybe we don't need elaborate liberal conspiracy theories, maybe this guy has everyone, his staff, the intelligence agencies, the sectaries, the deputy secretaries, the congress, traditional conservatives, the kitchen staff, everyone scared out of their collective minds. 

Sally Yates did a noble thing. She stuck by her principles. And her opinion has been upheld by 4 other judges. The EO that she refused to enforce is the same one that had to be rewritten by the administration that fired her.  
If it was acceptable and well received (speech) he would say it was good. If it was a shock and not well received (election night) he would say it was bad. 
We're setting the Bar awfully low aren't we? 

He had one good moment in a night where he read a speech from a teleprompter, and he managed to not trip over his own dick. 

Presidential? 

And BTW: earlier he had passed the buck for the operation that got her husband killed. I wish the selective outrage towards administrations of the other party wasn't so glaring. I would enjoy conservative values more if all the hypocrisy didn't get in the way.  
Lots of conservatives who believe in individual rights, personal responsibility, and small government conservationism take issue with the fact that they can't smoke weed whenever they want. 
&gt;elaborate liberal conspiracy theories

It isn't elaborate at all.

I'm saying that these politically motivated leaks might be politically motivated. It's not really that far of a stretch. People appointed by the previous President probably don't like the current President.

&gt;Or maybe, when everyone around you says you're an ass, and they don't feel any loyalty to you, maybe the problem is you (or in this case Him). 

I have no idea what you're trying to say with this jumbled mess of pronouns.
Suppression of journalists, meddling in foreign elections, hostile state takeover or "acquisitions" of private business interests, brutal targeting of the LGBT community, voter, suppression, jailing of activists, supporting Assad. Just off the top of my head. 

Seriously, google it. Putin has been in power for 15 years. Is there really nothing to see there? 

I am often confused by the reactions pro Trump news gets in this sub.... seems like no one likes him here.
Has a reasonable response been given as to why he kept Mr. Flynn in critical security briefings and intel meetings after he was told that Mr. Flynn might be susceptible to Russian blackmail? 

It seems to me that the real story is the possible breach of security on Mr. Flynn's part, but I could be wrong. 
In related stories, Kim Kardashian says her sex tape launched her reality TV show, and Janet Jackson said that exposing her boob at the Superbowl increase her new album sales. 

Suckers drive marketing campaigns.  
#not my president until you honor one wife of one slain Navy SEAL then legitimate president according to CNN 
I want to like him, I want him to succeed but I also value intellectual honesty. 

I cannot deny that this president embodies nearly every knee-jerk criticism that conservatives leveled at the previous administration. 

* Obama golfs too much

* Obama lies too much

* Obama has no experience

* Obama doesn't speak out against the violence in a particular group

and on and on. 

I simply cannot believe that it isn't apparent to everyone. 

From my limited time here I see a variety of ideologies. Reddit seems to be very left leaning so take that for what it is. 
I for one, support a strong Conservative party, but I also support a strong liberal party. I'll speak out against hypocrisy that I see in both. 
Yesterday he had a decent speech, but not great. This one moment wasn't transcendent from what I saw. 
Oh come on. They get a little elaborate. I've heard lots and I wasn't just referring to what you said. 
&gt; organized Democratic strategy to "resist" Trump.

You used the word "organized" 


&gt;I wasn't just referring to what you said.

Then I'm not sure why you're conflating my comment with other random people's theories.

&gt;You used the word "organized" 

Yes. I don't think it's a stretch to think that political appointees of a Democratic President consult with other Democrats before engaging in politically motivated leaks that harm a Republican President.
So what's your point? That he assesses information as it comes and analyzes it to form an opinion? 
Lol this sub hates Trump... Sad!
Just one example of many thousands.

Jesus said there are vultures where there are carcasses. When I see the media swarm on someone, my knee-jerk reaction is, "They must be a good guy." I mean, I'm seriously wondering here whether Hitler was half as bad as the media says he was. When you have a New York Times reporter go to the Ukraine and win a Pulitzer for saying "No Holodomor here!" you have to wonder.

Listening to Pewdiepie for myself, sure he uses foul language, but his message is a message of love and hope and equality and justice and mercy. He genuinely cares about people and wants to see them succeed. He doesn't care about skin color. He's a goofball, sure, but nothing he has done has harmed anyone or ever will.
Nope. My point is he will go against something he sees as unpopular while at the same time coming out for something he sees as popular. I thought this was pretty clearly explained. 
Sounds pretty fucking elaborate to me. 
When you say "I'm seriously wondering here whether Hitler was half as bad as the media says he was." Then you just jumped the shark man. 

Serious. I can't believe I just read that.
Not really. It could be summarized as "sometimes Democratic political appointees talk to each other and act in ways that benefit the Democratic party."

If you think *that* is elaborate, then good luck understanding anything else in politics!
But you also said organized. Doesn't that make it elaborate? 
&gt;But you also said organized.

Yes. So?

"Organized" applies to what I just described.

&gt;Doesn't that make it elaborate? 

Are you claiming that everything organized is elaborate?
How can you delineate between the two? 
It's not hard. 
Help a dullard like me out and explain? 
You're right. Clearly I'm confused. 

Organized doesn't mean elaborate. 

Organized could just mean "political appointees of a Democratic President consult with other Democrats before engaging in politically motivated leaks that harm a Republican President."

Just like it wasn't "elaborate" when the Bush holdovers did it during the Obama administration or when the Clinton holdovers did it during the Bush administration. 

Nothing elaborate, just organized. I feel like this was time well spent. /s

Edit: sarcasm. 
&gt;Just like it wasn't "elaborate" when the Bush holdovers did it during the Obama administration or when the Clinton holdovers did it during the Bush administration. 

I'm not sure why you say this like it's a refutation of my claim. If you think that similar things have happened in the past, then that makes it more likely to be happening now. Right?

&gt;I feel like this was time well spent. /s

You're the one who decided to tar my entirely reasonable comment as a "conspiracy theory." Don't feign offense when I respond.
"The soft bigotry of low expectations"
oh darn.  she'd be a great candidate.  betcha she could take all 57 states
Yes. It happens. It always happens. I initially was refuting your postulating (not theorizing) that its a democratic strategy to "resist" President Trump. 

I was saying that the leaks that have happened might be partly a result of the people around him not feeling any loyalty to him. Your statement about Sally Yates and this being an organized strategy made it sound like you believe that it's "very possible" that this might be happening, and because you don't mention other similar events, this case might be unique. 

This comment of yours, taken in context of the President himself recently stating that he believes that President Obama is involved is what *primarily* lead to my "elaborate conspiracy theory" comment. You didn't like me conflating the multiple events in context. Fine. My mistake. The two just seemed related. I hope you accept my apology. 

Again, this all is my mistake. I didn't understand the parameters of the discussion before engaging you. 

Now I know. 

* I shouldn't conflate your comments with current events to assume a context. Good to know. I'll try to be better. 

* I shouldn't confuse your statement that "It's very possible that the leaking and undermining is part of an organized Democratic strategy to "resist" Trump. " would make a conspiracy theory. Even though you clearly know that this has happened with many administrations in the past, you calling this **one** out isn't in any way theorizing a conspiracy. (Although it is a theory on your part and you did say that it is an "organized democratic strategy", almost like a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful, you know, the definition of a conspiracy.) Those were my words, not yours. 

* I shouldn't confuse having many people involved in an "organized" (or carefully arranged) plan to resist President Trump as an elaborate plan (making it an **elaborate conspiracy theory**). That's not the case here. Organized does not in any way mean elaborate. Understood. 

* I shouldn't confuse what you said later on "Yes. I don't think it's a stretch to think that political appointees of a Democratic President **consult with other Democrats** before engaging in politically motivated leaks that harm a Republican President." Again, contrary to my understanding of the words, this is not you engaging in a "theory about a conspiracy" **and** because you have not speculated as to the real complexity of this non-conspiracy, there's no way I should assume that you think it might be elaborate in any way. Just Organized. 

I'm not feigning offense that you responded. I feel well educated from this interaction with you. I look forward to more. 

Thank you for the reasonable discussion.


It's almost as if people brigade this subreddit to bash Trump...
If Trump told you that Hitler was literally the worst person in the history of the world, wouldn't you begin to have second doubts?

By the way, I am very certain that Stalin and Mao were many, many times worse than Hitler. I think on a per-capita basis even Fidel Castro deserves to be at or above Hitler's level.
 You seem to be defining a "conspiracy" as "any time people consult with each other or plan in private." Under your overly broad use of the term, every political strategy meeting would be a "conspiracy."

The term "conspiracy theory" is usually more specific and derogatory. For example, when someone talks about "September 11th conspiracy theories" they *aren't* referring to the theory that Bin Laden, Mohamed Atta, and the Hamburg terror cell conspired to attack the US. No, when someone says "September 11th conspiracy theories," they're talking about thermite and holographic missiles and all that nonsense.

But you knew this already, didn't you?

&gt;I feel well educated from this interaction with you. I look forward to more. 

That's quite a mood swing. A second ago you were sarcastically questioning whether this discussion was "time well spent."

Makes me wonder whether you're really arguing in good faith.
Hmmmm... So these arent angry Republicans but actual paid shills? That makes more sense
I doubt they're paid. Most internet fights are fueled by partisan butthurt rather than Soros or Koch or [insert billionaire boogieman here].
&gt;You seem to be defining a "conspiracy" as "any time people consult with each other or plan in private." Under your overly broad use of the term, every political strategy meeting would be a "conspiracy."

No I defined conspiracy in my response to you. 

&gt;a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.

Look it up. You'll find it accurate

&gt;The term "conspiracy theory" is usually more specific and derogatory. 

What people "usually" do doesn't negate that you provided a "theory" about a "conspiracy" as defined by dictionary definitions, and common sense, ergo a Conspiracy Theory.  

&gt; No, when someone says "September 11th conspiracy theories," they're talking about thermite and holographic missiles and all that nonsense.

Not exclusively. I also think that what you proposed could easily be defined as a conspiracy theory, but again, I was taking other events into account to provide context. 

&gt;But you knew this already, didn't you?

I do not concede that point. Also, you took issue with the term Elaborate, not Conspiracy Theory. 

&gt;Makes me wonder whether you're really arguing in good faith.

I don't want to argue at all. I do feel like it's a waste of time, but I want to be understood. I want to be clear. 

What political values do you have that are free from hypocrisy?
So beyond your sad little semantic games, what is your point?

Do you think that the Democratic-appointed defectors acted alone, without ever talking to any other Democrats? Do you think that Obama, before leaving the Oval Office, never had a meeting to discuss how the Democrats would "resist" Trump?

&gt;What people "usually" do doesn't negate that you provided a "theory" about a "conspiracy" as defined by dictionary definitions, and common sense, ergo a Conspiracy Theory. 

Are you completely unaware of the idea that words have connotations beyond their dictionary definitions? Dictionaries aren't the final say on language. Usage is.
This sub and /r/conservative seem to only have comments from leftists anymore.  I think most people left for the donald.

You started this sad little semantic game. 

Edit: Clarity 
Why can't the GOP own this issue? It's a multi billion dollar industry, it will cut the drug cartels off at the knees, and will make this country truly freer than it is now. This is how you lose the generational battle. 
these celebrities have no limit to their ego....
Yes, Van Jones bias towards Trump is sickening. /s
Nope. Check your exorbitant ego
Hitler half as bad as the media said he was. 

Nothing more needs to be said, except, I advise you to rethink your stance on the "news". You seem to be headed down a bad road.
I think he just keeps saying the same thing over and over. 
I don't think you got it 
Please reread Van Jones's actual quote. He said *if* Donnie can keep this up, democrats could have some real trouble. Meanwhile, absolutely no evidence exists to suggest sustaining this behavior is possible for Donnie.
Sorry youre correct I misunderstood
Analysis:  true.
Um actually no evidence exist to prove you right.
Did you vote for Trump? 
Some political scholars in America agree that voters choose the next President based on the performance of the previous one.  If the American people are disappointed by Trump, who is a Republican, they will give the White House over to a Democrat in 2020.  I think Trump will disappoint.  Even if he somehow shapes up, he is not going to become another Reagan.  So the Democrats are bound to win in 2020.  If Oprah wins the primaries, she will definitely take the White House.
To quote one of the comments that was posted when this video first hit the front page, this guy is a classic redditor. He reads up on a few key points and headlines, thinks he knows all he needs to know about the issue and begins to act and think emotionally about the subject. In reality, issues like these aren't so clear cut and black and white. This guys is a fucking moron. 
He got completely destroyed.  His children's children will feel the scars from this.
&gt;&gt;Do you think that the Democratic-appointed defectors acted alone, without ever talking to any other Democrats? Do you think that Obama, before leaving the Oval Office, never had a meeting to discuss how the Democrats would "resist" Trump?

&gt;This is sounding more and more like your definition of a conspiracy theory. 

So no actual response. Just more semantics.

&gt;&gt;Are you completely unaware of the idea that words have connotations

&gt;No

Wow, you never learned about connotations? Who taught you English?
I understand that whether or not I like it weed will be legal all across the United States in the next 20 years. Does that make it right? No. I know that the best investment a Venture Capitalist could make right now is opening up dispensaries, but does that mean I am going to invest? No. 

We are talking about a drug, not solar panels; just because they are an inevitability, a means for creating tax revenue, and are a savvy investment does not make them healthy or help our country to advance (especially in the field of education). It is an economic band-aid because the long-term effects of this drug on a generation mentally is yet to be fully seen. You are correct, this is how we lose a generation. 

https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/marijuana/what-are-marijuanas-long-term-effects-brain
Who taught **you** English?

&gt;Are you completely unaware of the idea...

My answer is no, I'm not completely unaware.

Since you're having a hard time with your own questions, I don't see much more reason to engage you.

Do Republicans see this as good or bad?
Don't uber drives know that they are going to be replaced by machines? Uber is one of the biggest innovators in self-driving vehicles.
So no actual response. Just more semantics.

You sure do like semantic games.
This dude is an idiot and got destroyed but... that doesn't make Shkreli right, either. His argument that he works in Rx and knows better than anyone is two-sided. Yes, it may be true, but that unequal expertise is a textbook strategy for abuse -- just look at the financial sector. "This is big dense complicated stuff, you wouldn't really understand, leave it to us. We'll be busy layering shitty CDOs on top of this house of cards, don't worry." That's not exactly what Shkreli says here obviously, but my point is that expertise is not a trump card in these situations (nor is his swagger and confidence, although it was definitely funny as hell).

The other major argument he makes is that Deraprim is comparatively inexpensive... so what? The fact is that the drug cost WAY less and was still profitable before Shkreli bought the patent and drove up the cost. This is a textbook example of abusing government protections to create an effective monopoly. Shkreli didn't innovate here, he didn't add any value to the economy. Without broken patent law, the drug would be much cheaper. This isn't isn't free market capitalism, it's socialism for the rich. 

While the "Harvard professor" (doubtful) did make stupid flamboyant claims about people dying, there is a real dollars-and-cents argument to be made here. Americans pay more for pharmaceuticals than anyone, and broken patent law and pigfucks like Shkreli bear significant blame for that reality. His actions contribute to higher drug prices, and in turn, higher insurance premiums. That reduces the overall quality of healthcare for all of us, and greatly expands income inequality. 

Again, just because this moron can't put together a coherent logical argument doesn't absolve Shkreli, at all.
Well you've taken this to a new comedic level for me. 
I've responded to everything you said, and you just come back with 

"no actual response. just more semantics."

It's time for one of us to be the grownup. 

I'm done.
&gt; I've responded to everything you said

Nope. You dodged this question:

&gt;Do you think that the Democratic-appointed defectors acted alone, without ever talking to any other Democrats? Do you think that Obama, before leaving the Oval Office, never had a meeting to discuss how the Democrats would "resist" Trump?

Your response was to talk about the definition of the term "conspiracy theory."
I'm not sure what you mean by political values that are free from hypocrisy.

But some examples of the hypocrisy would be what republicans have been saying for the last few years about what should happen when someone lies to congress. Attorney General Sessions sure seems to have lied to congress. Will all that past indignation still stand?

I would like to see a little self awareness on the part of politicians, and I would like to see us, the electorate, play our role in demanding a better government.  
Other countries might try to do the same.  I remember a major pretext the Bush administration used to invade Iraq is that Saddam refused to cooperate with UN resolutions and weapons inspectors.  Now Trump is going "fuck anything we don't like, we are above international law".  Others are going to do the same.  A few years ago, Russia annexed Crimea, a violation of Ukraine's sovereign territory.  Obama hit back with sanctions to redeem the honor of international law.
Couldn't be happier really. It's a great feeling being comfortable that the man in the White House is on the side of the American people, and isn't going to spend 8 years treating us as lesser than and apologizing for our history and culture. 
Yes incredibly. Trump isn't perfect but e has been keeping his word and doing the right thing despite a 24/7 attack cycle by the MSM (who he is exposing as the partisan hacks they are)
This is just wrong man. The paid protester thing is insignificant at best. It's been debunked endlessly. People are pissed. Fact.
I can make wild claims about white males in America if I want. I am one, doesn't mean it's true.
How has it been debunked when Project Vertitas has video evidence
I'm not saying it doesn't exist at all, but it's way too widespread to be all paid. When you pay protesters, you don't know them, you can't vet them. Any one of us could easily sign up, get paid, and run our mouths to the press. So there may be isolated incidents here and there, but it's not a widespread phenomenon. Most of the people protesting are real people.
Ok fine I can agree with the fact most protestors are not paid
&gt;I would enjoy conservative values more if all the hypocrisy didn't get in the way.

What ideological values do you "enjoy" that are free from hypocrisy?  You put forth the judgemental parameters by which you "enjoy" ideological values, I'm curious where you stand so I can research your hypocritical free ideology.

Pretty straight forward question.
The media has been trashing Trump's name since the 1970s.  They didn't start on him just because he entered politics as a Republican.
&gt; side of the American people

Which "American people" are we talking about?
If it quacks like a duck, it's gotta be a cuck
The one's in Russia.  
Haha fuck you, we've got the White House for the next four years, learn to live with it libtards! /s
Can't escape the shills no matter where you go. No one who isn't brain dead is buying the Russian connection garbage. It's all faux outrage and detraction from the left. Enjoy the next 8 years! 
There's only one American people, what are you on about? 
Real good counter-argument you came up with there.
Really is a false equivalence here. Trying to make this seem similar to clintons debacle. Article clearly states it was 1.an aol account, and 2. He took the proper channels to properly record the emails. 

Hilary had a truly private server and took measures to hide emails. The issue with Hilary was always about the latter and very much less about the former. 
Well yes but prior to 2015 he was still a broadly respected and popular figure, he had a TV shpw, he was on talk shpws all the time, just one of those typical pop culture fixtures. Nowadays though he has been turned into the untouchable megahitler, and "Trump supporter" is an insult usually mixed in with labels like "racist," "fascist," "sexist," etc. 
I have a hard time seeing how this is better. In this case a third party has control of state information. How is that better? [It was even hacked.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/03/03/lol-at-aol-mike-pence-hacked/amp/)
1.not federal secrets.
2. Its legal under Indiana law. 
3. He doesn't have power to wipe the server. 
That was not my impression.  He was widely regarding as an entertaining asshole; a guy who ran his businesses into the ground and picked petty public feuds with anyone who criticized him.  This is why so many people in the press are aghast that he was elected: they've been covering his bad behavior for decades yet the voters ignored that.  Have you read any biographies on Trump?  Just look for any book on him that was published prior to 2015 if you're worried about political bias.

George W. Bush didn't suffer this level of hate during his campaign or his first few months in office; the attitude among liberal journalists was just "Oh well, Gore didn't win, but this Bush guy doesn't look like the end of the world".  The attitude among journalists to Trump's nomination and then his election was **WTF HAVEN'T YOU BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TELLING YOU FOR FORTY YEARS?**
Which still isnt that far off from literally any other celebrity. But now he is all of that to the extreme + Hitler 2.0. QED. 

Also your claim that he was seen as a failed businessman back in the day is you applying the modern narratives backwards, and casts doubt on the honesty and accuracy of your perspective. As I recall nobody called him a bad businessman until that shitty john oliver bit last year, because before then nobody had a reason to claim that because its simply not true, John Oliver invented that narrative from whole cloth, and I know thats true because the reason that he did that bit, by his own admission, was to debunk the widely held belief that he was a good business man. I mean we're talking about a guy who's nickname was "The Comeback Kid," and you want me to believe that he was known for driving his businesses into the ground? So again, I have a hard time accepting your perspective as valid. 
What a thoughtful and persuasive argument. You really do conservatism credit.
"He did nothing illegal but we want to *feel* that it's illegal"
Feelings are everything amirite?
tl/dr: I like conservative values, but republicans aren't behaving like conservatives. 

Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear. I like conservative values. Full stop.

* I like smaller federal government. 

* I like the idea that the elected officials who have the most impact on my life are the ones who live near me. 

* I like local control of school systems

* I like minimal, pro-business regulations

* I like low taxes

* I like the ideas that conservatives tout about individual freedoms and personal responsibility

* I like controlled spending

I like all of those things and a bunch more that I can't think of right away.

I also see a lot of hypocrisy from elected Republicans, and I haven't seen that from Democrats. I'm waiting and watching. They had a chance to do something at President Trumps speech to congress, but they didn't. Nobody yelled out "You lie" even though he does. 

From my perspective, elected Republicans seem ready to criticize big government except for the military spending jobs program, drug war, LGBT rights, etc.

I feel that there is **more** evidence to support the allegation that republicans keep certain groups from participating in elections than there is that there's massive in person voter fraud. I'm not saying voter fraud doesn't happen, but they seem to refuse to acknowledge that there might also be other problems easily addressed that would make elections more democratic.

I've done some reading on common core, and it does try to address many of the concerns that conservatives have about local control of schools, but what most seem to do (with the exception of Kasich and Bush in the most recent republican primary) is misrepresent the actual policy, and just go for the easy applause line that it's a "federal takeover". I don't feel that it is. It's not perfect and it could be better, but I can see that it's an effort to address conservative concerns.

I don't want a bunch of regulations but arbitrarily saying that for every one new one you need to get rid of 2 existing, seems too simplistic. We should have data on what works and what doesn't. Demonstrate with numbers and I'll be easily convinced. 

Freedom and personal responsibility would be good arguments for recreational marijuana. I don't smoke it but I live in a state with high opioid addiction rates. Every study that I've seen says that legalizing even medical marijuana would help. Its safer and far less addictive than the alternative. Why aren't republicans in support of it? As a conservative who believes in science, I would be. 

Controlled spending, where were the fiscal hawks during the Bush years? Also, why was an infrastructure bill a non-starter a few years ago when it would have cost the US 0% interest to borrow money (in fact we might have made money doing it), but now that it's a republican in office and going to cost more to finance it all the sudden a great idea to get the economy roaring back? 

Finally, we have been digging out of a recession, it's been slow but it was a big hole that we found ourselves in. What has the Republican congress done to help? The answer, not much. It seems like they only wanted to help if they could do it without the Democrats getting any of the credit. It's not all on them, but they seemed to be putting party over country, much like they are doing with this current administration. 

The values aren't hypocritical. The values are laudable. I don't feel that the current Republican party is representing conservative values. And I'm not the only one who feels that way.

A good policy is a good policy, unless you care more about who gets the credit. 

Am I wrong about this?

Edit: clarify and deuglify. 
Looks likely you'll lose Congress in two years, though, at this rate, which would mean constant investigations and a lame-duck Trump. If more comes out, impeachment isn't beyond the realm if possibility.

This is all very serious. Trump had very little political capital going in and between his failed border measures and the Russia scandal, it may be all used up, barring some seriously competent political maneuvering. Which, frankly, there's been the constant threat of but has never actually materialized.

I'd caution you to temper your enthusiasm here. 
So your issue is that Hillary technically broke the law and you're, I assume, upset she used the flimsy excuse of not meaning to break the law to wiggle out of trouble.

So, how do you feel about the Sessions perjury?
Assuming the claims are real. He was asked about trump campaign Russia interaction. And his interaction was official capacity as a senator. 
&gt; No one who isn't brain dead is buying the Russian connection garbage

Really? I'm concerned, and I don't think I'm brain dead? 

I think lots of people are concerned about what's going on with the "Russian Connection". Even if the current administration had no involvement (and that's becoming highly dubious), there's still a lot of concern about with what Russia did, or at least there should be. 

Every American, no matter your party affiliation, should be calling for a full independent investigation into what happened, and how Russia did it. The more Trump people got caught up in this should also be a concern, but the fact that Russia hacked the DNC, created a large scale propaganda campaign to discredit one candidate (no matter the party), should send up some huge red flags (no pun intended).

Forget the MSM, Forget the Trump Dossier, forget the celebs and the woman's march. Listen to the intel community. Russia succeeded in playing a nefarious role in our election. Full Stop.

They succeeded in hacking the DNC and leaking the contents to Wikileaks, during the campaign. They employed trolls to spread disinformation to sway the American electorate. This is all beyond dispute. Don't ignore these facts because your guy won. 

All the other issues might develop into a concern. I'm certainly watching the Jeff Sessions stuff closely, and I would love to see President Trump stop throwing shade on Russia and Putin. As an American, I would like to see him criticize Putin like he does everyone else. Why is there this one blind-spot when it comes to his criticism?




&gt; and the Russia scandal

what EXACTLY is the Russian scandal?  everything printed or cablecast to date ends with "and there is NO EVIDENCE of wrong doing".  that, of course if AFTER 1,500 words of slander
REPUBLICANS are HYPOCRITES, and so is The Czar-Fuhrer...

You Repugs speaking Cyrillic yet?
Unless you are a billionaire, corporation or Russian double agent, these lying fools are not going help to you to any of us common folks... 
You need to interject "YET" into your DIATRIBE.

The Whitewater investigation was about a land deal and ended up about a blowjob.

These Russian questions WILL NOT STOP.
 A private email account? 

AH-OH! 

Lock Him Up!

Lock Him Up! 

YOUR Czar, much like Nixon should resign. These guys ARE crooks.
 
Getting a better paying job because there are more companies competing for your skills sounds like it will benefit millions of "common folks"
Did this sub get taken over by shills?

Ever heard of the boy who cries wolf?

Funny... That is EXACTLY what the Bush cronies said before driving the economy over a cliff due to deregulation, unnecessary wars, and banks running wild selling derivatives..
Russia at absolute worst phished Podesta the pedophiles email. Concern trolls like yourself are making a mountain out of a mole hill. If it were shown that Russia changed the vote totals I might agree with you. But as it stands all they did was release info to Wikileaks. If information is made public and its nefarious to the point that it causes people to change their vote... then I say: Good. 
As the noose tightens...

Bush and his cronies were morons. Trump has the best cabinet ever assembled so far, successful people in their own rights.

Trump's plan will continue to work and he hasn't even implemented his tax policies yet which will create more jobs.

Keep trying cuck.

Bush and co do not represent the Trump era Republicans as many of us were Democrats when Bush was in office.

I don't understand the point you'm were attempting to make. 
The WHITE ones that HATE the BROWN ones.

Trump is The Race Baitor In Chief... but WE all know that. 

Wink wink.
So you will believe the Podesta/Pedophile news but you won't believe that Russia actually implemented a propaganda campaign against the democratic candidate?

So we take his word for it that he didn't commit perjury? He pinky-promises he didn't discuss campaign stuff, even during the meeting at the RNC? I would say that's pretty dubious. The Q&amp;A was, essentially, "Do you know of any communication between the Trump campaign and Russia?" "I'm in the Trump campaign and I never met with any Russians." The information wasn't even necessary, it was volunteered, and it was factually incorrect. Arguing about which hat he super-duper-promises he was wearing is really irrelevant, imo.
lol

The Russia scandal is a real thing, no matter anyone's opinion of the facts. Rumors of pro-Russia shenanigans at the RNC (one occasion Sessions met the Russian ambassador) surfaced the next day, not long after Paul Manafort resigned over ties to Ukrainian/Russian politics, Intelligence agancies confirmed Russia was trying to affect the US elections, the Wikileaks docs were claimed to be of Russian origin, Trump has refused to criticize even the worst of Putin's actions, General Flynn resigned because of possible vulnerability to blackmail from Russia, Trump appointed to his cabinet the former head of a bank known to specialize in laundering Russian money, now the Sessions thing, and I know for a fact I'm forgetting a couple other Russians connections. 

This is a narrative that is rolling out of control, catching great interest, and upsetting a lot of people. It is most definitely a scandal.
It's not me. It's those darn 17 Intelligence agencies that all agree. But, you've got 4chan, wikileaks and infowars, so you're right. Tough call. 

I don't want to insult people, but the standard of proof should be similar, no?

Integrity and intellectual honesty only takes into account what one does with the knowledge they possess.

All because of some spooks? I honestly have more to fear from the DHS or NSA than I ever would from a foreign nation. Fuck yourself.

Middlebury College, another anti-free speech institution recently prevented Charles Murray, a controversial writer from speaking because his words were deemed too dangerous to be heard by the children. A race-baiting professor who condoned the protest debated Tucker Carlson on his Fox News show and unsurprisingly asked out of the blue “Do you think black people have lower IQs than white people?”

The $63,000 a year school was ranked by Forbes as the 34th best college in the United States. However recent concerns about the sensitivity of the student body has experts concerned about the employment viability of Middlebury’s graduates. Hopefully enough safe workplaces exist were these children don’t have to endure the horrors of opposing views.

&gt; "Of course, that's what she meant," said the spokesman, Drew Hammill. "She has never had a private one-on-one with him."

That... actually seems reasonable. A "meeting" is different than someone sitting at a table near you with 10 other people.

In this climate though, you should definitely be crystal f'ing clear about whether you were ever within 10 feet of this guy.
you fuckers need to start learning about context FFS, why do you all deny reality and adopt your own?
wow.  a Cali judge that's not wack job left.  wow

In the video the professor repeated says she doesn't condone the protest at Middlebury. She led her on protest at Princeton where students walked out as soon as he started speaking. There are two separate events being discussed.

Based on the article it just seems like Kenya picked a more expensive product manufactured in NY over one manufactured in NC. This happens constantly in business and who knows the other factors in the decision(certainly not explained in the article). 
I don't think you need to concern yourself with where integrity or intellectual honesty might get you.

I don't need to question your patriotism. It's in full view for everyone to see. It's like a drunk, puking over his car wrapped around a light pole saying "Don't you dare question my driving skills!" We can all see your level of patriotism. It's on full display.

It appears as though you maybe love half of America (the half that agrees with you), and you certainly love your right-wing news. You love 4chan, Infowars, Breitbart, but you seem to have no love for the intelligence community that has been tasked with keeping you safe and your freedoms in tact. 

All you do with your pro-propaganda rant, is give conservatism a bad rep. And the fact that you choose to be profane, well that's just gravy I guess.

Also, thanks for all the downvotes. Nice to know you can handle discussions with someone who disagrees cordially. That's a true sign of civility. /s

I agree this isn't the same thing as Hillary's case now that I have read more about it, but it still raises concerns about his competence  and the way he conducts himself. I honestly don't know what to believe is really going on. The Democrat narrative is that Trump and his administration are all in league with a foreign government or otherwise compromised by Russia. Meanwhile the Republican narrative is that this is a baseless witch hunt and that Democrats are just out to get them. I'm sure the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

There have been enough links, albeit tenuous, that I'd be more comfortable with some sort of independent, non partisan investigation. Obama was slammed on the lack of transparency during his administration. All I want is a team of leaders that are clear, concise, and forthright. I do not disagree with Trump's administration on a great many of their policy views. 

I don't at all like the amateur hour performance they've put on these first few weeks. All of these stories could have been killed before they even started if this information had been brought forth willingly during the vetting process for each of them.

Yvette Felarca, public school teacher and part time domestic terrorist once again led a march in UC Berkeley to disrupt pro-Trump supporters and silence free speech. The public school teacher and part time domestic terrorist led an army of militant liberals armed with pepper spray and hoods that hid their ugly faces. 

UC Berkeley has long been a hotbed for anti-semitism but recently has become feverishly anti-free speech and anti-American. The University continues to collect $370M in public tax payer funds while institutionalizing hate and promoting violence. 

Sociologists and education analysts have expressed concern the once prominent university which was once ranked the #1 college in the world may have substantially degraded itself in recent years and could be producing an overwhelming number of unemployable hate-filled bigots.

Honestly, all of this stuff is starting to get so sickening. What the hell is wrong with us Americans? I get that people are upset with president trump and some of his orders, but at the same time this is why we have a government of checks and balances.  Personally, I always think of this scene from band of brothers when it comes to all the complaints about trump, you salute the rank, not necessarily the man: https://youtu.be/MTRZRRlA4sw

Good news is obama and hillary are going to jail
the Dems are soooooo good at obfuscation, years and years of practice
Trump keeps tossing allegations with no proof yet. This is a tactic that Putin and his buddies pull all the time. Remember when US Presidents had class? 

Yes, I know the anti-Trump press does the same, but Trump is not a journalist, he is the head of state. He should wait until the FBI or State Department completes its investigation and delivers a report. That's how Obama handled Ferguson.
Good peice from Wired about why this may be worse for Trump than Obama if it is true. https://www.wired.com/2017/03/feds-wiretap-trump-tower-not-obama-worry/

of course no proof.  feeding the lame stream media ANYTHING causes another eruption of twisted fake news.  you'll NEVER see Trump nor any other politician serve up meat grinder softballs to the "media"
I think that's just how she interpreted the guy's work...
We don't know if there is proof yet or not.  The president is privy to a lot of things the press and the American people are not.

For all we know the president has already been told he was being wire tapped and the report, when released, will verify his assertion.
I really hope Malik's brother will go to jail but it's a long shot 
Liberal trolls have infected almost every subreddit, and almost every group of mods.  A lot of money being spent to influence minds here. 

So Trump believes Obama's white house wire tapped him.  This would hardly be a stretch since the NSA was recording everything then, and we were caught red-handed bugging foreign governments.  Unanimous sources state that Obama had him bugged... for me that's enough to warrant a little bit of scrutiny.
How many liberals have to be in this sub for the top rated comment to be attacking "you people"... namely Republicans.  Libs, go back to your own sub... you know, r/politics.
Literally every single comment by non left wing trolls in this thread agrees that he won't. The only person saying he will is the click bait headline. 
The Obama Administration wire tapped Angela Merkel. Is it really such a stretch to believe this may have happened?
Not really actually http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/yes-obama-could-be-prosecuted-if-involved-with-illegal-surveillance/
No he won't. People in the Bush administration should be jailed for actual war crimes. If we aren't willing to send them to jail or even prosecute them nothing will happen to Obama. 
As are Republicans. Both parties are corrupt to the core.
If only! You forgot Bush btw.
**Links work now, apologies**

Mark Levin, lawyer and former chief of staff for Attorney General Edwin Meese laid out the overwhelming evidence that Barack Obama’s administration secretly wiretapped Donald Trump’s campaign headquarters. 

The consequences for anyone abusing the FISA court system are significant and a former President isn't immune from crimes against the country. The affidavit used by Obama's team to obtain their warrant omitted Trumps name and may have falsely been disguised an issue of national security, which is the sole purpose of FISA. Even investigating election fraud wouldn't qualify for a FISA warrant. FISA court members trust the government is only bringing them surveillance about pending terror attacks or war-like attacks, that is why out of 35,000 requests for surveillance, only 12 requests have ever been rejected. 

The main stream media is convinced this story is fake news but at least six news outlets have reported on such clandestine activities in the past few months.

This scenario has no upside for Donnie. Either he is lying, reducing his credibility even less, or he is telling the truth, which means there is probable cause to think Donnie is/was involved in illegal actions connected with national security and a judge signed off on the warrant.
Well... where are the *Republicans* then?  I came here looking for some smart Republican viewpoints on the current state of affairs in the Trump Presidency (you know, getting outside my bubble and all that), but this sub is dead.  I guess there are no Republicans left, only Trumpistas.

As for this topic, I'm sure Trump will come up with the evidence for this wiretapping claim right after he finds Obama's Kenyan birth certificate.  
Any Republicans who didn't associate themselves as conservative, have already left to register independent, libertarian, or non partisan. I, for example, was a registered Republican for about a decade. Had to leave it. I was hoping the tea party would just go away, but like some kind of bad virus it mutated into Trump. Now I honestly don't know what the GOP is anymore, but I do know that I cannot be apart of it. 
I've heard a lot of my friends say that they didn't leave the GOP, the GOP left them. 
Unanimous sources? I haven't seen a single source showing trump was specifically bugged only a request to bug Trump tower. Trump tower doesn't equal trump specifically being bugged.

yea, we're doomed
So bugging your home doesn't equal you being bugged.  That's some mental gymnastics.
When the mods take over they slowly ban all of the viewpoints they don't like.  Look at rpolitics... do you really think no one posts any pro Republican stories?  The rule is:

"Post or comment only if you support the GOP and its candidate Donald Trump"... I wonder why the mods aren't enforcing it?

"Evidence": page not found 
"Watergate on steroids"? The fact that you said this shows that you don't know much about Watergate. Going to a judge, even though it is a secret court, is different than breaking into the offices to spy on your opposition. These are agencies and not some henchmen from the Whitehouse. It is comparing a warrant to a burglary. The burglary will always be worse because it is actually breaking the law. So......enjoy being a hyperbolic fool. 
That doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. Is the claim so hard to believe? The media, including far-right outlets like The Guardian and The New York Times, have been reporting on various wiretapping of people in Trump's campaign for months now...but it's unbelievable that the FBI might have wiretapped Trump directly?

Come back to me when the DoJ releases a report.
I guess anything is possible. According to Trump, Obama wire tapped him and "found nothing". So...

- The FBI had suspicion of something illegal going on.
- The FBI applied for a FISA warrant, was rejected.
- The FBI applied for a different FISA warrant, was approved.
- Presumably wiretapped somebody.
- "Found nothing"
- The FBI said nothing, and did nothing.
- Trump won.

That seems like how the system is supposed to work? It's inevitable in our system that every four years a sitting president will preside over an intelligence agency that could investigate the opposition party's presidential campaign. If we need some additional checks and balances let's do that.
&gt;Nice to know you can handle discussions with someone who disagrees cordially.

The rest of your comment is personal attacks.
Foreign surveillance isn't highly illegal. 
The fact that we are even entertaining this ideas is mid blowing. What did Obama have to gain from taping Trump's lines? Trump won the election. I don't get this at all.

Twitter is lightening up this evening with hundreds of Donald Trump supporters who just received their inauguration invitations, nearly 2 months late. The post office, which prides themselves with the creed "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds" may have intentionally stopped service in order to undermine Donald Trump's vast public support and curb attendance.  
An email with gmail, aol, yahoo etc isn't much different than a private server. 

1st. With a company provided email, it's easier to socially engineer / hack the account because you only have to trick the service into resetting your password. Private servers shouldn't have password resets because you can use the machine to set passwords.

For other types of security it's hard to tell which is better or worse. It would be specific to the setup. Yahoo got hacked pretty badly for example. But just because the private server wasn't, doesn't mean it's more secure.

2nd. Many company emails "read" the contents of the email to provide advertisements. This makes the contents of emails you send on them less secure, and malicious ad code can potentially read email contents.

(Although, as a caveat, some of this can be mitigated by using a non website based client such as Outlook, thunderbird, etc.)

So to me, it isn't much of a difference in rather or not it was on AOL or in her basement. Neither one is better/worse than the other without specific details.

Having setup email servers many times, it's actually easy to keep it relatively secure. Gmail, aol, yahoo etc all have security holes simply from their popularity, they integrate multiple services into an account and how they must provide password reset tools for their users.

The statistic was "30% of terrorism is refugees". 

Which means 70% of terrorism is not refugees...
yea, true, but what percentage of our population?  that's why the 30% number is gargantuan 
That's also true, but then again how common are terrorist acts in general? Exceedingly rare.

3024 people died from foreign-born terrorism in the space of last 40 years (1975-2015), which includes 9/11 with 2983 people. Without 9/11, the number would be 41 people *total* in the last 40 years.

Let me put these numbers in perspective. Around 31 thousand people die in car accidents in the U.S. every year. Over the last 40 years, this would make roughly 1,240,000 people.

40 years: 1,240,000 people dead in car accidents, vs. 3024 by foreign-born terrorism, with 9/11.

One more number: on average around 13,000 people die every year in the U.S. from gun violence, be it homicide, unintentional shooting, or murder/suicide. Over 40 years that is 520,000 people.

40 years: 520,000 people dead in gun violence, vs. 3024 by foreign-born terrorism, with 9/11.

From all those gun violence deaths, an average of 750 people are the *unintentional shootings*, every year. Over 40 years that is 30,000 people.

40 years: 30,000 people dead in *unintentional shootings*, vs. 3024 by foreign-born terrorism, with 9/11.

So truth is, even if U.S. closes its borders entirely, this would make no impact in the life of the average American, who would keep seeing their friends, colleagues, relatives die in large numbers due to poor healthcare coverage, gun violence and car accidents.
Republicans don't hear your facts, so facts don't matter. Earmuffs!!!!!LALALALALALA. Using logic doesn't work. This is a great conundrum for people who argue with them. You can also spout climate change statistics to them and it makes no difference. Any ideas anybody? 
it's good to see Levin has FINALLY backed off is many-months-long one-subject show...Trump bashing 24/7.  he must have lost 1/3 to 1/2 his radio audience with that horrible burlesque
&gt; but then again how common are terrorist acts in general? Exceedingly rare

hmmmm, maybe [more than you realize](http://www.dailywire.com/news/11410/complete-list-radical-islamic-terror-attacks-us-james-barrett#)
I already gave you the statistics. If you have to compile a web page listing every since case of death by car accident or non-terrorist gun shootings, your browser would crash under the weight of the page trying to load.

Do numbers mean nothing here? *Orders of magnitude in difference*?

What if we support the GOP, but see severe problems with President Trump?

Is it hard to believe that someone could be a GOP supporter, or at least a strong supporter of Conservative Ideals, and at the same time take issue with the very concerning administration? I don't find President Trump to be very conservative. 

&gt;"Post or comment only if you support the GOP and its candidate Donald Trump"

By that requirement, I could make an argument that even President Trump couldn't post here. 
Even if there was a FISA warrant issued, and someone was monitoring something in Trump's building, Why on earth would President Trump make such a statement, and release it on twitter of all things? How does this make sense? 

Does he not know that he destroys his own credibility with 60-70% of the nation when he takes these things so trivially? Where's the moderation? Where's the calculation? Where's the desire to lead the country, not just the base?

Per capita
tl/dr: It seams like some are making huge leaps with the Trump wiretap story. One of those making giant leaps is the President. Is this normal?

So, I've been reading about all of this. I have some questions/observations for people who believe that President Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phone. 

* Why do we assume that the surveillance was on Trump or Trump people, why couldn't it have been on Russians. From what I've found it's only been alleged that "wiretapped communications [had] been provided to the White House", but that doesn't mean that the wiretap was on the Trump, or even the American side. This all becomes less relevant I believe when you know more about the Server issue, but President Trump calls it a wiretap on **his** phone. 

* Anyone who knows about FISA requests should know that they almost never get denied. The fact that the first one from June 2016 was supposedly denied, and then a new more narrow request was made, should make us think that the system is working as intended. Someone was watching out for the civil liberties of those involved. How is this scandalous. I'm not sure if it is. Maybe it isn't.

* Why does James Clappers alleged lie to congress in 2013 automatically negate the burden of proof on Mr. Levin? Saying that someone lied 4 years ago doesn't create actual evidence in support of an argument, at best it casts doubt on the denial, but Mr. Levin still seems to have a very weak case here. 

* The Heat Street (who I'm sure is loving all the new traffic to their site) states "giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia." We already know about the questionable history of certain Trump campaign officials, could these not have been the target of the FISA warrant request? Why do we translate this to a wiretap on Donald Trump? Why does the President? 

* Again from Heat Street "While the Times story speaks of metadata, sources suggest that a FISA warrant was granted to look at the full content of emails and other related documents that may concern US persons." Metadata isn't actual data as most understand it. It's data about data. Metadata is like knowing **when** an email was sent, and **who** sent it, but knowing what the **actual email says** is different. This statement shows that they knew that something possibly problematic existed, and they used the warrant to see if there was anything to be found. Understanding that metadata is different from actual data is important. How does this translate into a wiretap? 

*  It's also been reported that this surveillance wasn't even of Trump Towers. The server in question was possibly a server hosted by an outsourced email company in Philadelphia. This puts the whole thing another step removed from President Trump. It makes his tweet about this being a tap of his phones even more peculiar. This man has the brightest most competent surveillance and intelligence agencies at his disposal, how does he get this so wrong?  

* Knowing all of this, and allowing for the fact that President Obama was in power at the time, how can we make the leap to say that he ordered it? These intelligence agencies may communicate to the white house and the administration may even direct them in their investigations, but Mr. Levin gives no evidence that President Obama actually ordered anything. President Trump also makes this unsupported claim. 

* Finally, Is there not more evidence that there are certain Trump campaign officials had ties to Russian people, that they were asked about and never disclosed? Isn't there more evidence of that than of President Obama "tapp(ing) my phones during the very sacred election process."

Just my observations.
Just because a tower may have server rooms, office space, operation centers, etc. 
I'm not sure how to read your comment. What's per capita? I mean, obviously, 30% of refugees are not terrorists ;)
Are you suggesting that Obama was wiretapping Trump's office space, but not wiretapping Trump?  Homes can have office space.  Homes can have servers.  I think you are trying really hard to say Trump wasn't wiretapped, but you've already conceded that his HOME was wiretapped, so this is just a ridiculous argument.
Yet here I am. 

Sounds like you've got very strong feelings on this subject. If the mods want me removed then they can. Until then you may just have to choose to ignore me. 
Sean Spicer was asked at today’s press conference if President Donald Trump will be less distracted going forward and more focused on issues that matter for American people. Spicer reminded the reporter that President Trump been busy focusing on repealing Obamacare, keeping the nation safe a stronger vetting program, meeting with over 50 foreign leaders, issuing over 30 executive actions and meeting with business leaders to bring back Jobs to America.
I do have very strong feelings on the subject.  After being booted from r/conservative and r/republican for being a Trump supporter, I thought the idea of a Republican sub that supported Trump would be a great idea.  They won't enforce the rule for the same reason you won't obey the rule... because the mods are liberal shills pretending to be conservatives just like you. 

Shocking you're the same idiot who thinks wiretapping Trump's home is not wiretapping Trump.  No one could be that stupid, hence you are most likely a liberal troll.  
I watched the whole video, I'm not seeing anything malicious. What am I missing? What's the clear evidence that the Obama administration did anything wrong here? 
Maybe you were booted for being confrontational? Could that be the case? For calling people idiots? Calling people liberal shills? Perhaps the issue is the lack of civility. 

I want to discuss politics with Trump supporters. I want civil dialog to happen. I want you to explain to me why you think the way you do, and I'll explain why I think the way I do, and together we have a more thoughtful dialog. If you're looking to just post comments to people who already agree with you then please ignore my comments. I don't need to move along just because of your sensibilities. 
Some Republicans do hear facts. Not 100% of them, but come on. 

It is nice to see constructive dialog using data. Data is a beautiful thing. 
There are no rules in the sub about being a dick, so stop being a fucking snowflake you ignorant piece of shit.  Yes, I'm being rude, because you are clearly violating the rules, you know that you are violating the rules, but you don't care because you are here to stir up shit.  Period.

If you want to talk to Trump supporters, go to Ask Trump Supporters, or r/republicans, or r/conservatives.  You are not welcome in this sub, this sub is specifically not for you.  There are only 3 rules in this sub, and being a Trump supporter is one of them.  Sorry, but there are other subs for you to be in.  If you want to be a shithead and stay in here even after reading that rule, then fuck your feelings asshole.

So in /r/republicans, according to you, you can be a dick, you can call someone a 

* fucking snowflake

* an ignorant piece of shit

* a shithead

* and you can tell someone to "fuck your feelings asshole"

You just have to be 100% on board with everything President Trump does. I don't agree 100%, but I've been respectful. 

I wasn't going to leave before anyway, but now you've made it entertaining for me. I couldn't go even if I wanted to. I'm starting to feel like you getting booted from other subs was more a criticism of your character than anything else. 

BTW, even if the mods do kick me out, you'll still be you. Getting me banned won't add an inch you your character. If you can't handle a civil online discussion with someone who may disagree with you, you've got bigger problems than having to tolerate us alleged "snowflakes". 

In a related point, how a Trump fan could call liberals snowflakes, and not see the yuge irony in that insult, just kills me. 

Edit: added stuff
&gt;That's also true, but then again how common are terrorist acts in general? Exceedingly rare.

In 1962, zero Americans died from Soviet atomic weapons. Should JFK have just ignored the threat of Soviet missiles in Cuba because American deaths from them were "exceedingly rare"?

In 2006, housing prices had increased every year since 1991. Should mortgage brokers have ignored any possibility of a crash, since prior data showed that a price drop was "exceedingly rare"?

In 2015, no president had ever been elected without first serving in either the military or a prior elected office. Should pundits discount the possibility of Trump getting elected because it's "exceedingly rare"?

You get the idea.

I think your method of analysis is too subject to normalcy bias. There are some events that are low probability but which have a very high potential impact.

Matthew Vadum, Senior VP at Capital Research Center and award winning investigative journalist thinks ObamaGate is way bigger than Nixon's WaterGate and deserves a full congressional investigation.
&gt;your protective space

I see this criticism often from anti-Trump people. Please elaborate on why you think that forums can't have rules.

Thanks.
&gt;If you have to compile a web page listing every since case of death by car accident or non-terrorist gun shootings, your browser would crash under the weight of the page trying to load.

So? You're setting up a false dichotomy. There's nothing preventing us from address both terrorism risks and non-terror-related risks.

Heck, if your line of thought was carried to its logical conclusion, car crashes and gang shootings would also drop off our radar. Going by the numbers, we would pretty much only be concerned with heart disease and cancer, to the exclusion of all other causes of death.
I didn't say that. Obviously Forums can have rules and if the mods want me off then I'll leave that to them. 
So why is the president not focused on the big issues, but the smallest issues? Worth a thought. In theory, we can work on all issues at once. In practice all public discussion and action at the high levels is aimed at preventing something which is comparatively irrelevant. 

Your own logic calls for instant universal healthcare, gun control, and heavy focus on public transport. 

Yet the entire public discourse is what? Immigrants.  And healthcare is about to take a nosedive, as well. 


Whats the problem?
Getting told to fuck off if you say something as controversial as a presidency by tweets is a bad idea.


Data is a beautiful thing, but as you can see everybody is refusing to believe/understand LTArmaki's analysis, so they are proving my point. Also, look at all the data for health care that Republicans ignore. I find it hard, as a human being, to support all the harm and unfairness they want for society.
Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham debunked the media's false claim that there is no evidence Donald Trump's campaign had been wiretapped during the campaign by specifically pointing out a New York Times front page article printed January 20th.

&gt;Obviously Forums can have rules and if the mods want me off then I'll leave that to them.

Then I don't get your criticism of "protective spaces."
&gt;Your own logic

Huh? What argument did I present? I was criticizing the logical end of *your* argument.

You might want to read my comment again if you're confused.
[removed]
Don Lemon has a text exchange with Black Lives Matter leader Shaun King to explain why he is black even though both parents on his birth certificate are white. 
On Sean Hannity's Fox News show Monica Crowley warned President Donald Trump that the Washington establishment wants to destroy him, personally and professionally. Blood is in the water and they will not stop until they win. President Donald Trump should do the best he can to drain the swamp as quickly as possible. Tens of millions of dollars have been raised by the perverted David Brock for impeachment proceedings... but if one person is strong enough to beat all odds and survive... it's going to be Donald J. Trump. Winners always win. 


My criticism wasn't of the desire for protective spaces. My point was that asking for protective space, *while throwing around the insult "snowflake"* is a bit hypocritical, isn't it?
This is a well formulated counter point. 
I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge civility. 

Carry on. 

I would agree that it is comparatively irrelevant in a discussion about total acts of terrorist violence. So few terrorist acts by refugees have occurred, it would seem like resources could be better utilized elsewhere. 

I also agree that a single act of terror could change that in a moment. One incident like 9/11 skewed those statistics in a big way. 

My bigger concern is that we get caught up on this issue, and miss others. Building a wall would seem like a good idea, but more so if we had evidence that terrorists had entered from the southern boarder and that a wall would prevent that. Or that our current measures were deficient in some way and a wall is the right answer. It would seem that were being asked to fund a very expensive wall to prevent a relatively small number of serious crimes. I also think that a wall is low-tech and will be ineffective. 

Better would be to show how the increase in spending over the past few years had demonstrated a marked improvement in our security situation, and therefor spending more would be advisable. I haven't seen that but I would like to.

Also, a new immigration rules seem like a good idea, if there's a demonstration that our previous immigration rules were deficient in some way. I haven't seen this. I've hear it stated by people who know, the hardest way to get into the US is by way of the refugee program. Why would we blow up our current system if it was working? Has it been demonstrated ineffective? Are we being smart about our problems and our solutions?

My feelings are that we're depending too much on what feels the right course would be, without having thoughtful discussions about it and basing policy on data. We have 200+ year of history as a country and thousands of years as a civilization, we shouldn't be guessing at what might work.
First people wanting to change their gender and now their race, what is this world coming to...
Lol anyone who defends that psycho has gone off the deep end 
In my state any man, with the consent of the mother, have his name listed on a child's birth certificate. So, his bio-dad might be black and his legal dad could be white.

***At the same time,*** why does this matter? What good is there in criticizing a speaker instead of what is said? Can anyone point to a significant number of statements he has made which would change to the point of either undermining or affirming what he has said about race relations based on his perceived or actual race? Dumbass me would have thought it far better to disprove the *claims* about race. If such disproof cannot be done, what does that say about those concerned about Shaun's race?
You do realize the people firing the pepper spray have been confirmed to be Trump supporters, right? Rather silly to directly or indirectly try to connect her to at least that.
Fascism was profoundly illiberal.  Fascism was totalitarian.  Liberals in America are not arguing for the end of democracy, which are things that Mussolini and Hitler openly advocated.
&gt; Liberals in America are not arguing for the end of democracy

ours is not a democracy.  it's a republic

and, what libtards argue for is *against* the Constitution, the entire foundation of our freedoms
exhausting.  the allegations are berserk
&gt; and they will not stop until they win

the one thing I strongly admire about the left...they STICK TOGETHER no matter what
&gt; and, what libtards argue for is against the Constitution, the entire foundation of our freedoms

Explain, please.  I am not a troll, please explain.
&gt;My point was that asking for protective space, while throwing around the insult "snowflake" is a bit hypocritical, isn't it?

I don't see how that follows.
liberals hate the Constitution because the Constitution lists 1. individual freedoms, 2. restrictions on government power.  to the contrary, liberals BELIEVE in all things government, that government should control, basically everything

one famous line (I think it was Sen. Tom Daschle) who said, "You can't professionalize until you federalize" proving he believes everything LESS THAN total government control is wrong
I don't know how I could make it any more simple. 
I just don't see the connection between "snowflake" (which is a criticism of quirkiness or uniqueness) and asking people to follow the rules of a forum.
I always took it as a derogatory term for hypersensitivity of the younger generation. Liberal students who are less resilient and needed their safe spaces on campus. 

That was my understanding. 
At least it was a peaceful protest 
More details, please. More specific. 
&gt; More specific

Individual Rights vs Government control.  it's that simple.  the Constitution is a mega list of **Individual Rights** specifically designed to disable the tyranny of government.
What I meant was specific examples. Give me something specific that the Democrats did that violated a specific section of the Constitution. 
[removed]
Seriously, give me some example and I'll go read the Constitution to figure out what is wrong with it.  I know that the Supreme Court found nothing unconstitutional about Obamacare because they examined it four times and refused to strike it down.
We are a democratic republic. Liberals may be social democracy leaning, but in no way would I consider them to want "total government." That just sounds like a euphemism for communist really. 
"If a black man publishes a book saying that people with more melanin in their skin are more intelligent, do I have to read it to know that's wrong?"

Yes you fucking idiot! If only so you know for sure that **that's actually the fucking point he's actually trying to make** and not some "fake news" story you read from some liberal blog. This person's a professor, and they're actually complaining that they don't have time to *read*?! Well, hey, listen, maybe cancel some protests where you shout people down, and instead try reading, and we can avoid all this drama.

These smug pseudo-intellectuals on the left drive me insane. Yes, when I was liberal, I heard a lot of shit from other liberals about Atlas Shrugged and some other conservative books, and I naturally had an instinctive dislike of them. But when I took the time to fucking read them, I found the criticism was at best, over-hyped, and at worse, a deliberate attempt to obscure some important discussions.
I wish she would actually explain WHY his scholarship is junk.
You don't have to read a book to understand a thesis and she admitted that she only read a critique of the book. I haven't read "Mein Kampf", but I know it is racist. Racists have been trying to use science to back up their claims for a long time.
You can't just use "the Constitution" as a byword for your vaguely defined political ideology.  The Constitution is a legal document.  If you say out of hand that something is "unconstitutional" you leave yourself vulnerable to refutation by somebody who actually takes the trouble to read the darn thing.
That's fine and all, but it isn't the position intellectuals are supposed to have.

*Someone* has got to read it.
:-)  I had to email that link to my people
Sounds like they got reasons right. Should charge more for the book!
"We still don't know a lot of concrete details"....
Sometimes, but in this case, she doesn't even know what his thesis is. She heard someone call him a racist, probably read some quotes out of context on a blog, and that was good enough for her.
Report this dumb alex jones shit people. Libtards are brigading this sub trying to make us look like conspiracy theorists.
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend"?

My sister ( A ny liberal) used to tell me all the time of the crazy anti obama people who she would see on CNN screaming about him being a secret muslim looking to enact sharia law, and all this other crazy nonsense, and I would always dismiss her as paying too much attention to a few crazies on the right.  After seeing this lunatic doing the same on the opposite side of the isle, I see why my sister would get so alarmed.  These lunatics have other lunatics following them, thats a scary thought. 
I am sorry but you are speaking nonsense. yes liberals tend to push for more federal social programs, but they are not looking to destroy the constitution. And the conservative supreme court decided the constitution was there to defend the rights of whoever has the most money in citizens united, not individuals.  Roberts, a staunch conservative, and bastion of the republican party decided that whoever has the most money should get the most political representation.  It was also George bush who first passed the "patriot act" and limited our right to trial, and privacy.  The idea that conservatives seek to protect our individual rights is long dead, both conservative and liberal politicians are mouth pieces for different corporate interests.  If you really think one is for personal rights over the other you need to show some specific examples.
I thought we were talking about refugee terrorism, not one of those incidents involved refugees.  please provide a few incidents of refugee terrorists so we know why this is worth spending 50 billion of my tax dollars on.
I think Republicans made a terrible mistake by choosing Donald Trump as their man.  They should have chosen a man that the opposition (Democrats and liberals) could at least respect.  Instead, they chose a man that Democrats and half the country have judged to be an asshole with whom a healthy working relationship is impossible.  From the moment he won the election, Donald Trump has received a level of hostility that Bush and Reagan never faced.  Liberals would have loved to have Al Gore as their President but they felt that George Bush was at least a decent guy whom they could work with.  They don't see that in Trump.  They see a monster who must be opposed at every turn.  And this could tear the country apart.  Yeah, you can rebuke the "libtards" and the "traitors" all you like but that's not going to fix the immense badwill that Trump has fostered.
I think he meant "anonymous" sources. Lol. 
Damn this was a very good counter argument.
That... is so unnecessary. And it's not politics. It's tabloid journalism.
Dan Savage is the guy who wrote about licking doorknobs while sick to try and give Gary Baeur the flu. He's neither a good journalist nor a decent human being and not sure why anyone here would care what he says.

Trump is a damn fool for accusing Obama of being behind this conspiracy. Obama should be going into quiet retirement now, like George W. Bush painting mediocre portraits, but thanks to Trump's paranoid ravings, Obama still holds political relevancy. Trump's ravings keeps the public's attention affixed on Obama, and gives them the impression that he still has strings to pull. Since power is a game of attention and appearances, the appearance the Obama is still influential gives him actual influence.  He can pretend to pull on these phantom strings to ask for favors or intimidate people.

you call yourself a republican? more like a communist.... a video about Trump and America is crappy? I wish I had you in my unit in Afghanistan... you piece of communist crap! 
Poe's law in full effect here. 
Frankly, Donald Trump's campaign was worse.  Donald Trump won the Presidency **despite** a terrible campaign.  I've been reading the works on some political scientists and have learned that a candidate's campaign actually doesn't matter all that much to his chances of victory.  Things like how the economy fared during the previous four years, or whether there is a significant third-party candidate, are much more important.
As well as an unshockingly low to no response to negative news 
directed at them.
What the fuck? Do you forget his unbelievable performance in the primaries? Do you forget how a Republican won *Michigan* and *Wisconsin*? 
If the White House (and OP) doesn't know who the leakers are, who is to say they are Democrats?
I am pretty sure trump is leaking himself to distract people from things
The civil service is nonpartisan and important to a functioning government
Since when has anything been drained that you'd use the term "also"? Hiring establishment figures like Rick Perry, to Oil moguls like Rex Tillerson, and lobbyists/bankers/corporate execs isn't draining shit. It sure as hell doesn't mean they care to do anything for the average Joe. I genuinely can't understand how so many are duped into thinking a bunch of billionaires give a shit about them.  We already used more than half the economy on war but you're all duped into spending more on that. Meanwhile incidents like Flint are happening all over and no effort is being made to fix it. Yeah America sure is great again if you're a rich bastard and haven't crossed the president.
not worth reporting
If you expect logic and consistency out of this administration, you're gonna have a bad time.

This is bait. Edited entire other side. 
that's weird since he said he was literally wire tapped, I guess that's slang for "I make things up constantly in a vain effort to get attention even though I am president of the united states".  Geez I guess we are at fault for thinking you mean wire tapping when you say wire tapping.

You're a strange republican
Hey look at that. Enemy propaganda in /r/Republicans. Nice. 

It's RyanCare. 
Not the narrow definition of wire tapping. Electronic surveillance is way beyond that now. 
RyanCare?  I thought Trump was firmly in charge.

It sucks that r/republicans was created as an alternative to r/republican and r/conservative, but you cucks can't read the rules and just want to spread your disease everywhere.  Misery loves company I guess.

I give a shit. Exactly how must I support Trump to be included in the club? 

If I support his lobbying ban but I hate that he's opposed to climate data, do I support President Trump enough? 

If I supported him when he said that he wouldn't cut Medicaid, or social security, but now I'm concerned that he's supporting the AHCA that doesn't keep those promises, Do I support President Trump enough? 

If I liked it when he said that he would allow the federal government to negotiate drug prices, but he hasn't and he seems to have backed off on that idea, do I support President Trump enough?

If I believed him when he said that he would show his tax returns if he was elected, and he now says he won't, do I support President Trump enough? 

If I support the GOP, and I support CANDIDATE Donald Trump, can I be in this club? 

Maybe our support for President Trump isn't the issue, maybe it's his support of us? 


What club are you referring to?  If you're asking the rules of this subreddit, read them your goddamn self or ask a mod and quit being a douche.
I'm asking you. You're the self-appointed auditor of Trump supporters. You're the one setting the metric for who can be here and who can't. You're the one pissing yourself because actual conservatives who believe in conservative values have infiltrated your safe space. I read the rules, and I'm just fine with them. 

Newsflash, not everyone who disagrees with you is a liberal shill. Not everyone who thinks President Trump isn't keeping his promises is a cuck. Sometimes reality is reality, and a dick is a dick, and buddy, you seem like a big dick. 
&gt; Post or comment only if you support the GOP and its candidate Donald Trump.

That's the rule.  I didn't make it. 

Conservatives who don't support Trump have a subreddit.  This is a subreddit for conservatives who do support Trump.  Don't be a dumbass your whole life son.

You've lost all concept of what a 'safe space' is.  A subreddit is not a safe space you stupid bastard.  Grow up, obey the rules.  It's not that complicated.
Fuck... I can't watch it, massive UK fan. Everyone loves her, and loves when she comes to the games. Now she's doing this crazy shit
Why is her Facebook post a subject to report on? Let her say crazy things. Who cares? It's not like she is the president of the United States or anything.
There really should be a law against trying to deceive American voters during a debate.  It's the whole point of debating... an even platform.  She should be unable to show her face in public.
See the word candidate? 
What the actual fuck
Agreed...and for all parties.
Of course they are. If they can't make it in their shithole country, what chance do they have here of becoming productive members of society
See the word Trump?  Dipshit.
pretty amazing.  I can't recall a Dem who admitted to anything

maybe she went to church
Kerry, Dukakis, Dole, McCain are all contenders
Jesus, did he watch Trump!?!!
Worst candidate to win the popular vote, maybe. 
She got an unprecedented level of help from the media and still lost somehow.  
and as usual, NOTHING happens...Dems are never punished
Nah, she just got caught.  The media has been colluding with the Dems for a while.
Not at this unprecedented level. 
Seems fair, republicans are never "punished" for what they do wrong.
Who's the dipshit? Insurance for everybody? Candidate Trump isn't President Trump. It's a good thing the lying liberal didn't win. SMH.

That we have found out about.  
Yes, I am aware politicians lie.  That doesn't change the fact that you should be having this discussion in a different sub that doesn't explicitly forbid it.
Ok I'm leaving now. It's enough for me that you admitted that he's a liar. It would be nice if people acknowledged that he lies a whole lot more than other politicians but I'll take what I can get.

I've got to go find more intellectually honest people who are interested in more than just a pro-trump circle-jerk. Enjoy your echo chamber.
Trump ran an incredibly good campaign. Set records for primary turnout, took almost no corporate wealth, best a 'sure thing' candidate and ended up winning states that hadn't gone red since the 1980s. It was one of the best campaigns in a generation. 
How can they pass this off as news. This isn't news not many people like Hillary, and this is essentially beating a dead horse, democrats will not endorse Hillary for another major office again. Her daughter they might but to just bash her like that is ridiculous she isn't Hillary and she isn't Bill. People should judge politicians on their own actions not those of their parents. 
Is referencing the Iranian Revolution as his source of wisdom?  Because the Iranian Revolution was started by secular leftists, who were then defeated by the Islamists who then seized power and locked up the liberals.
China hasn't forgotten the Golden Horde. They aren't opening their doors to Muslims anytime soon. 
Six out of seven of the countries barred from traveling to the United States under Donald Trump's travel ban have barred Jewish people from entry into their countries for decades. Unfortunately liberals have become so Anti-Semitic they simply don't care or are too busy calling in bomb threats at Jewish Community Centers.

Banning beards is kind of awkward. How long should I not shave before I become illegally bearded? Also, how would a Chinese cop know if my beard is a Muslim or Christian or atheist?
Clinton ran a lousy campaign but that doesn't mean Trump ran a good one. I think any other Democrat could have beaten Trump. There are a lot of people who really hate the Clintons and Trump got many of their votes by default. From the convention to election night Trump's campaign was in a downward spiral and was really only saved by the surprise announcement by Comey that the FBI was taking an additional look into Clinton's emails.
Think what you want. I doubt you'd agree that Obama won because McCain and Romney ran terrible campaigns. Such is life for a Democrat though. 
Was this in Louisville? 
keeping Comey seems sooooooo totally un-Trump like
I think Obama won in 2008 because the Democrats really loved him and McCain wasn't a very strong candidate. Romney was better but it's hard to unseat a popular sitting president in a good economy.

The same was true for Bush in 2004. Bush was still popular and John Kerry wasn't really somebody the Democrats could rally behind.
Name any GOP candidate for the last century and a half. They got fewer votes in the primaries than DJT. You won't find a level-headed political scientist who thinks his rise was anything short of historic and remarkable. 
Well there's more voters today than there were in the past so it makes sense that he would get more votes.

And his campaign was certainly historical and remarkable but that doesn't mean it was well run.
So all you can attribute his success to is the birth rate which hit rock bottom last year? That's why he got millions of more votes than Romney, McCain, Bush, Reagan Nixon etc? 

If you think Trump ran a bad campaign, you must also think all Republican campaigns in history were as bad or worse. 
&gt; So all you can attribute his success to is the birth rate which hit rock bottom last year?

People born in 2016 can vote?
Of course not. What makes you think that? You made a claim that more people are around to vote, but in fact you will find that the birth rate has been trending down so much that last year it hit the lowest point in our history. 

Mind replying to my last comment again? 
&gt;You made a claim that more people are around to vote

[Voting age population:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections)

2008: 230 million  
2012: 235 million  
2016: 251 million

&gt; the birth rate has been trending down so much that last year it hit the lowest point in our history.

A lower birthrate does not mean there are fewer people. Also the birth rate is not the only way to increase the number of Americans.

Finally, how is the birth rate in 2016 relevant to the 2016 election when the youngest person who voted was born in 1998?
She sang at most of the Cleveland Browns home games this year as well - she's an amazing young lady
It is amazing how no one has any comment about this at all.
Tell you what: you stay out those liberals' safe spaces and they'll stay out of your churches.
Churches? You mean the fast food chicken place? I'm pretty sure they'll sell food to anyone. Also, they're not my churches, I don't own the franchise.
Stampeding RINOs...
Only 4% of the Dutch population is Muslim and there are no Islamist parties in the parliament.
Trump won by appealing to peoples' biases and fears.  He won on lie after lie and then complained that if he lost it was because the system is rigged.  He didn't have a "good" campaign if by "good" you mean "respectable".  It was only good in that he won.  But there are a lot of reasons why he won (or why Hillary lost).  But I think the way his campaign worked says more about his voters than his campaign.  Pretty much everything he said didn't even pass the sniff test but his followers will go down shouting the same rhetoric until they are blue in the face, no matter what actual facts say.
The economy was gaining somewhere around 180,000 jobs per month before he took office, so I'm sure he'll take credit for the job growth.  Anything that can actually be attributed to him will be superficial, I'm sure.  Just like the Carrier deal.
Not a Lifetime Achievement award. It's a Lifetime **Channel** Achievement Award. Big difference. Headline award seems odd for Chelsea the actual award seems fine.
You'll never understand why your side lost this election. And the media you consume will never help you understand. 
My side? I'm an independent moderate. My side has never won. 
Correct. 
You guys are still on about this?  The election is over
Hillary is/was a terrible messenger.  Often her words contradicted her record and intentions.  So many gaffes.
OP, the video you're linking to is Nunes talking about surveillance of foreign agents, where certain Trump staffers have spoken to said foreign agents, and so they were recorded as part of the foreign agent surveillance.

Obama is not involved, and Trump staffers were not the target, the foreign agents were the target.

So titling this "ObamaGate CONFIRMED" is quite misleading. Nunes says in **this very video** that this is **not** about Obama ordering wiretapping on Trump.

Did you even watch the video you posted?
You are arguing syntax. He confirmed Trump was being monitored. He said he cant rule out who ordered it. ObamaGate refers to the Obama administration misusing intelligence services to illegally monitor Trump. Fuck off. 
Not one positive quality about her. Hope she runs again in 2020
He didn't say it's illegal, he said it's probably legal. 

He didn't say Obama's administration ordered it. 

He said Trump's staff was not the target. 

That's not **syntax**, those are the **facts**. 
Just wait you need more facts to understand, when the cucked FBI is forced to comply and hand everything over we will know the truth. I can connect the dots with just this but I understand why you need more.
&gt; cucked 

T_D is leaking again.
So, if I understand you correctly, what you're saying is that you're not upset that Trump staffers were talking with Russian spies. You're pissed off that investigations into the spies exposed the Trump staffers.

Personally, I'm pissed off that Twitler interfered with an active investigation, but I have to laugh at how he outed himself.
Trump did not speak with Russian spies. He is PRESIDENT. He speaks with the ambassador or even Putin himself. The Obama holdovers leaked classified information. Furthermore his administration funneled 3 billion dollars to political organizations, spied on 156 judges, supreme court justices and businessmen across the country.

You don't know whether it was done legally. Obama administration spied on 156 judges, and the chief justice of the Supreme Court. It seems very likely that Obama ordered it and that the spying on Trump was illegal. Obviously the classified information leaks were illegal too. There was a whole lot of illegal activity in the Obama administration. The assassination of Scalia is just one off the top of my head.
&gt; You don't know whether it was done legally.

You seem to be not reading carefully what I'm writing. I'm literally repeating what Nunes is saying. 

**I personally** don't know shit. But I have eyes, ears, I know English, and I know how to play the linked video.

You on the other hand, seem to be speculating. What do **you** know? What are your sources?
&gt; The assassination of Scalia is just one off the top of my head.

Uh-huh.


What?  Since when was Scalia assassinated? 
Also, they were spying on foreign agents. They happened to catch some of Trump's team because the team was talking to these said agents during the election.  

Did I somehow stumble into /conspiracy? I thought this was /republicans. 


Lol he confirmed foreign agents were being monitored. Trump and his team's conversations were picked up because they decided to talk to the foreign agents. If they weren't talking to suspected hostile threats to the US, they wouldn't have been recorded. 

Kind of like how if you're watching your neighbor to make sure he isn't stealing your newspaper and you happen to catch your wife going over there in her best heels and a trench coat during lunch. Your wife wasn't the target and if she had been faithful, you would have no recordings of her. 



The cancer is spreading, my friend.
He wasn't president during the election though, and he wasn't even running when Manafort made deals to push Putin's agenda. Also, the number of people here with backdoor Russian meetings is pretty weird and suggests an organized agenda. 

And you really have an Obama boner. Every time someone presents you with data about Trump, your response is: But, Obama! 


1. Foreign Agents were being investigated. 
2. Trump staffers were caught talking to these foreign agents under investigation. 
3. Trump discovered that the investigations into the foreign agents had exposed his staffers. 
4. Trump attempted to manufacture outrage by suggesting the investigative wiretaps on the foreign agents were actually illegal wiretaps on Trump's phones.  

He's like a thief who got busted because his fence is under investigation. And then claimed that the police had been illegally spying on him instead of lawfully spying on the fence. 
**of course** Obama did it.  using that "deep state" stuff as cover
Sad that this sub is infiltrated by imbeciles. 
¯\\\_(ツ\)_/¯
Why does he berate people for telling the truth? When this mental midget finally snaps under the weight of his delusional bosses lies it is going to be awesome. 
Because they're not telling the truth. 
You know things are rough when you need to find a single poll giving you 50% approval (most are lower) 2 months into your presidency. 

For context, at this point into Obamas first term, he had 63% approval and only 26% disapproval. 
The same reason I'm banned on this sub and your comment is controversial 

Edit. Oh cool I'm no longer banned 
maybe because the cnn one says 4:47 in the corner and your tv says 7:07.... you know the news does repeat broadcastings through the day... 
He can hang from the same tree next to the rapist illegals. 
I don't understand, how do they have a case?  Isn't it statutory rape at the least since the guy was 18 and she was 14?  Forced or not forced, it's still rape.  Am I missing something?
The station says 4:07 PT, not 4:47. His TV says 7:07. That lines up if he's in the Eastern time zone. Also, if you keep watching the channel time, it swaps over to 7:07 EST at one point, then back to 4:07 PT. Check it out the second time he swaps to CNN, it says 7:07 first, then swaps back to 4:07 PT.   
  
Edit: Plus they both say live on the screen. If it was a repeat broadcasting, that wouldn't be there. 
I can't view it

 Good luck with that. Let me know how that works out for you. 
Well, she's not wrong... 
Lol
Even with majority! Tsk, tsk

This is very interesting. I'm not sure what to make of it to be honest
T_D will spin this as a victory for Trump. He now knows who the loyal ones are so he c an drain the swamp 🙄
You gotta have little to no sex life to be pulling shit like this. The whole website you've linked in was a joke proving little to no proven conclusions that women prefer conservative white men over every other man in the world. This world is falling apart
that incompetent Ryan needs to GO NOW
**of course** women are more attracted to conservative men.  men being the key word.  snowflakes have their following, but desirable women prefer smarter men...men
yea, Pelosi, Schumer and all other libtards were counting on Ryancare passage to bail their asses out.  now, Obamacare will crush with even higher costs for less and less "coverage" (unless you're a guy and need a pregnancy test)

You clearly didn't read the article 

&gt; concern among some scientists, including space baron Elon Musk

I can't stop puking...space baron...projectile vomit
If you google FullyLoadedNews, I believe the website shows up on the 2nd page of Google, it's not even a credible source of information 
It cites the study. It didn't conduct the study. 
so ...seems [Muslim Outreach](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/07/07/nasas_muslim_outreach_106214.html) is over?
It never sites the study. Actually, it just says "a study" with no hyperlink to said study. Further research shows that this "study" has never happened. They say one Sarah Grant lead the study. All you have to do is google her name and "women prefer conservative men" and nothing shows up. Actually, the study itself says they recruited women from conservative states, so that by itself is biased and untrustworthy. 
Hillary needed all the help she could get and it still didn't gel her
When it collapses, we'll get the real reform
In other words 

&gt;it's not MSNBC OR CNN. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
Man this sucks. I thought for sure this would pass. 
Haha going to show my gf this sees what she says.
What the heck?
Wow that is so messed up. 
I don't care for either of them either, but if they were to have a study like this and then not post hyperlinks to the study itself, I would be doing the same thing 
Found the shariablue user 
Yet you trust jewgles rankings. Shocker. 
Did they ever follow up on that? 
What search engine should I use then to convince me this is a real thing
I'm wondering this too. 
That was 2013: http://www.nbcnews.com/id/52184794/t/new-allegations-state-department-cover-up/

Since this would require a large cover up and one that large held that long would surely come undone by now, I'm going to guess "false".
Why does it matter the order listed? Why does that provide validity? 
June 11, 2013.
Under Hillary's State Department.
Dodged that bullet.
I don't know anything about it, but if the football program at Penn State has the power to cover up a problem I'm guessing the highest ranks of the U.S. government do too. I'd feel better if I knew that at some point it was given a flow blown independent investigation.
Concern troll.
Hey I will say you go me there, I've found good articles past even the fourth page of not just google but other search engines. Regardless, this isn't a valid study
Pretty sure you should find a dictionary.
That was a much smaller cover up than this alleges. The larger the conspiracy, the faster it falls apart. (Mathematical proof available upon request)
Did you? 
heres an article from breitbart about this naming who was involved.  if any one wants to follow up and post for the rest of us too lazy to do there own research http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/06/11/whistleblower-hillarys-chief-of-staff-quashed-state-department-scandal-investigation/
what reform? the reason this last shit bill didn't pass is because there was not even one cost cutting measure in the bill.  It gave insurance companies the ability to charge whatever they want for coverage and penalized every one who didn't want to pay.  No buying groups, no interstate markets, no drug cost negotiations, no cap on insurance profits, nothing.  Not one single line to regulate costs.  It wasn't a bill to fix the health markets, it was a bill to increase insurance and pharma profits, and every one on both sides of the isle saw it for what it was.  If thats what the party wants to pass, you should hope obama care stays where it is.  Lets wait till we have actual representatives up there instead of corporate shills before we try to pass any thing affecting the health of every american.
no shes not, republicans in the house and senate said the exact same thing.  she may be a little creative in her presentation, but the numbers didn't lie. people over 65 would have had an 800% increase in the cost of there insurance, and people making over 250,000 a year would have gotten a 5 to six figure tax break.  Neither ryan or trump denied this, it was an important part of there plan, and they hoped no one would notice.  I am glad both parties put there foot down and crushed this thing like a bug
because much of government's power is the power to say NO to citizens 
[deleted]
I gotta ask because I feel like I am alone in this... are any other republicans here upset that he is wasting so much time and tax payers money with crap like this?  between him and his family I think the estimate is going up to a million dollars a day for security alone... why are our congressmen and senators not calling him out for this crap daily?
What is he wasting time with?  He's accomplished a lot in a very short amount of time.
It wouldn't be as bad if he was golfing someplace like Andrews Air Force Base which has all the security a president could need right there. It would be significantly cheaper for him to go there in both travel costs and security costs. Not to mention that he would be closer to the White House.
Probably just did one of them before air. It's possibly the show is marked live and not the interview. 
you and me must have very different political goals, or very different ideas of what needs to be accomplished while he is in office.  
So far everything he's started has been stopped by the court, or blocked by his own party. 

May he accomplish a lot, and I hope the tax reform goes well, but so far what he's accomplished is a lot of talk, a series of minor diplomatic embarrassments and a bunch of even more embarrassing domestic executive and legislative fail starts. 
This will in no way muddy the waters in the fight by law enforcement and NGOs against actual child trafficking.
Penn State was a far smaller issue. More importantly it has far fewer eyes on it. The whole world has reporters in Washington, it is covered on the news every night. And that press loves to smell blood. There is probably one local paper at State College and the local TV stations do not want to say bad things about the football program.


Fuck off you fake republican. Half of your posts are pro bernie faggot bullshit.
Because he is an actual republican and you are a bernie supporter. 

He's killed TPP, ordered construction on the border wall, froze federal hiring outside of the military, and approved the Dakota Access Pipeline.  There's a few.

Seems to me that you watch too much MSNBC or you're not paying close enough attention.  Politics is a marathon, not a sprint.
Yeah like he replaced Obamacare and banned Muslims and convinced Mexico to build our wall and....Uh....
killing the tpp was huge i had almost forgotten about that
Except they are. Manafort is even cooperating. 
Yea, killing TPP is about the ONLY good thing to happen, fuck the pipeline and the hiring freeze.
Good job, that's sure to shit him up. More people should talk like you. Things would get done.
Great comment, glad you could find time to comment between drinking another can of Schlitz and talking your daughter into showing you her tits again.
Somebody doesn't know how government works.  Hint:  its this shitbag I'm responding too.
&gt;Somebody doesn't know how government works.  Hint:  its ~~this shitbag I'm responding too.~~ our current president.


I'll be sure to do that faggot!!  
- There are already negative impacts from killing TPP, where companies that target the rest of the TPP market plan to move out of the U.S. (the same as the "brexit" effect in the UK).

- The border wall, which both construction and security expects say will cost dozens of billions and have no effect on illegal immigrants (because you can't build literally an uninterrupted cement wall over this entire varied terrain).

- Freezing hiring outside of military hurts people like young veterans, who rely on those jobs for their survival, and has introduced chaos and blockages in other federal institutions.

- He approved the Dakota Access Pipeline with foreign steel (he promised U.S. steel), and instead of the promised 20,000+ permanent jobs, reports from the bidders are that there will be 33 permanent jobs.

I'm paying very close attention. His actions so far have either resulted in a monumental waste of money, or loss of jobs, or both. The other fall way short of his promises.

And just so you know my attitude... I was hoping Trump would be the most effective president in U.S. history. And for a few brief days into his presidency, as I watched him quickly get to action and sign E.O.s I even believed it. But they I looked into the **results** of his actions, not just the PR and noise, and the picture there is getting uglier by the day.
What companies have announced that they are leaving because Trump killed TPP?

You must not be paying much attention to the wall, because it's been stated numerous times that a cement wall won't be the only solution.

What veterans are going without work because of a hiring freeze?  We are almost at full employment last I looked, you're telling me they can't find a job anywhere?

They are just now commissioning the full pipeline, where are you getting that they're not using American steel?

Let's see some sources on all that nonsense.  Never mind the fact that you should probably just fuck off from this sub because it's obvious you aren't a Republican, and when faced with a fact based rebuttal to your claim that "Trump ain't doing nuttin" you go on a rant fueled by idiocy and left wing bullshit.

Source it sport, then we'll talk.

We don't need to call each other names, when the (lack of) results speak louder.
poor Joe, he's sooooo weak
Rush and Hannity have been destroying since the day it all started
9 of the ten poorest states, and nine of the ten states with the lowest median incomes are republican.  Not every city can have oil, tech, or wall street.  saying nine out of ten of something does not create or indicate causation or correlation....
Actually, it does indicate correlation (pretty much the definition of correlation, actually). But you're right, it does not indicate causation, and the article does not suggest that it does. Rather, it is identifying that the current (and past) governance of these cities has been ineffective in preventing their decline across multiple metrics. As a result, perhaps a new technique is in store. Putting aside all partisan values, if something doesn't work, it should be fixed. Governance in these cities should be fixed, as should the governance in the 10 poorest states, regardless of leadership. 
you are absolutely right, and I like your response.  I hate partisan spin on what is clearly not a partisan issue.  bad governance is not a monopoly held by either party and needs to be pointed out and addressed regardless of who is in power.  The problem we have is that party politics makes people support there representative no matter how bad he is "cough cough boby jindal", because he wears the same color shirt as them on election day.
I'm glad these cities are fighting for their small government.
Like? All I've seen is meaningless platitudes, and some unlawful executive orders, the most egregious of which has been shut down in courts. 

His first attempt at legislating has ended in a catastrophic failure. 
I've already answered your first question, see below.  His executive orders for the travel ban were not ruled unlawful on any grounds granted to him by the Constitution, it was struck down because of his rhetoric on the campaign trail; these rulings will both be struck down by a higher court.

The Republican Party doesn't work like the Democratic Party where everyone toes the line because of the letter after their name.  There are numerous factions within the Republican Party and eventually they will pass a new healthcare plan.  It's certain, Obamacare is a catastrophic failure and something will have to be done.  Me personally, I'm glad the law didn't pass as are much of Trumps base.

Trump has been in office less than 100 days and you morons think that minor setbacks have already defined his 4 years.  I bet you're also one of these dipshits that believe Trump is a Russian spy.  Why the fuck are you on a Republican sub when you're obviously just a troll?


Wow. That guy is seriously trying to deny that the NSA collects everything now?
It certainly seems like Trump and his associates are very involved with the Russians.
[removed]
First off. Devin Nunes has really made a mess of this whole investigation and republicans dont need this kind of bad press. The intelligence he said he has, he has not shared with anybody but the target of the investigation. That is a huge red flag. 

Secondly Nunes called off the meetings for the week. Most likely due to yates testifying about flynn.

Lastly comey and Rogers investigation is still ongoing, it is believed they have cancelled this particular meeting because of Nunes actions, believing that he or the committee may be compromised and will not share classified information with them.

Now is the time seperate from this sinking ship.
what makes you believe that?
Wikileak releases prior to the election.

Easing of sanctions on Russia for Ukraine.

Manifort's financial dealings which appear to be money-laundering via Russian oligarchs.

Stone's relationships with Assange and Guccifer.

Shady dealings with Russian banks by many of Trump's inner circle.

Trump's lack of financial disclosures.

Nunes' bizarre behavior.

Trump's public praise of Putin.

Jeff Session's lack of admission of Russian contacts.

Flynn's resignation.

Sally Yates situation.

As a lifelong Republican, I'm concerned about this pro-Russia administration.

Why do we have to wait? 
False:

Sean Hannity = alternative facts 
If only we had politicians and intelligence agencies that could investigate the truth of these allegations and report back to the American public.
Who is this man? I saw him do that cool shit with his glasses the other day and now I want to hear him speak. Also, does anyone notice the cold eyes this reporter has? It's like she's a robot 
If Putin were actually trying to fuck with American he would've tried to get Hillary elected 
Of course he would say that. The evidence is mounting against him now. It's only a matter of time before this whole thing explodes.
I hope that's a sarcastic joke, because this is all a load of bullshit.  And if Putin wanted to buy a politician and influence our elections, he already owned the Clintons and their campaign manager.

In 2010, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, was one of nine federal agency heads to sign off on Russia’s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada with operations in several U.S. states. It was part of a regular process for approving international deals involving strategic assets, such as uranium, that could have implications for national security. Uranium One’s U.S. mines produced about 11 percent of the country’s total uranium production in 2014, according to Oilprice.com.... this is what you linked to???!???? and you think this makes the claim false? look for a new job.

Barack Obama's “right-hand” and national security advisor Susan Rice reportedly requested the unmasking of members in Donald Trump's campaign. However, when asked on March 22nd, in an interview with PBS News Hour about Devin Nunes’s assertion that evidence supported the fact members of Donald Trump’s transition team were surveilled by the Obama administration Susan claimed the she “knew nothing about this” and even found the New York Time’s story from January 20th "perplexing". 

Susan Rice quickly diverted away from the surveillance allegations proceeded to criticize Donald Trump in a number of ways including stating that his administration wasn’t “fact-based”… ahh the irony!

Hindsight is 20/20 but if you look at Susan's closed body language, heavy breathing (at 2:02), and rapid eye blinking… the signs of lying are abundant.

If the wiretaps were legal, a judge had probable cause to believe the intercepts involved criminal activity 
the uranium can not be shipped outside the US, and has to be sold to the US.  it gave them control of a mine that legally has to sell all its uranium to The US, the mine is located in canada, and still sells all its uranium to the US, you can look it up.
Deflection at its finest.  If a judge ordered the wire tapping, there were reasons.  Even if Obama asked for it, it wouldn't matter since it requires a judge to grant the order.  If the judge granted them, there was a reason that was worthy of the wiretapping.  This isn't a partisan issue.  This is our Admin colluding with a foreign government.  Why does it always have to be so partisan and deflecting.  Obama, Hillary, they are not in office anymore and have on influence on what our government is currently doing.  
it'll be a fine day when some of these Obama henchmen GO TO JAIL

isn't he pro citizens united? as far as I am concerned that is the defining issue of our political landscape today.  This is the only reason I can't support gorsuch.  If we really wanted to "drain the swamp" this would have been the first thing trump looked into when appointing some one to the SC... there are plenty of conservative judges who are anti citizens united.
&gt;now
What about his made you hate him? 
is only joke
As a racist sexist homophobe, I am extremely offended by this.
He's making fun of Reddit.
&gt; isn't he pro citizens united? 

no/yes/no/yes.  he's for **upholding** The Constitution regardless of the parties' arguments
That sort of asssumes the parties valued workers to begin with, doesn't it? 
Yes. Let's totally ignore the Russians and focus on what someone said on TV.
I'd like to remind that candidate **Jeb Bush** was a top promoter of Common Core.  man, did we dodge a bullet or what?
Common Core is a good idea in theory, but in order for it to be practical we would need to give all schools in the US Equal resources for their students towards learning. The Issue with that is that if all public schools are to be made equal it would basically require federal intervention whether through a law that would put stress on poorer states like Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi. So a better way would be for the Federal government to take over all school districts which would see large changes to schools and new development that wouldn't have otherwise been possible. Of course there would be large pushback and budget cuts for schools would become even scarier as our youngest children could negatively be effected everywhere across the country. On a side note however the claim that Massachusetts is the worst is misguided as they were rated the best school system in the US.  Which leads me to the question are you someone who has to take these tests currently and just don't want to, or did you do any research before making your claims?
Does he believe that they voted for one? 
Are they capable of passing this? 
I doubt anyone in the white house knows what the AFL-CIO is 
As a liberal, I can't wait for her to finally go away for good, I have never been more tired of hearing about one persons desperation in my 50 years of living.
we moved from that to cutting 9 billion from education funding, cutting school breakfast and lunch programs, eliminating funding for after school activities, cutting 17 billion for academic research, cutting 4 billion from pell grants, and cutting all funding for the arts.  whats the difference what kind of prep the kids get for tests, or what kinds of tests they take, when the schools will just be a shell of what they should be any way?  But don't worry, the military is getting an extra 54 billion that they neither want, or need.  We are still getting those abrahms tanks that generals say they don't want or need and take up resources maintaining lol
Funny, I didn't see "Because I was a deceitful, shrill, joyless harridan who constantly told average Americans how awful they are while basking in the praise of the Leftist Media. And also fuck you for asking." on her list.

Because that was a YUGE part of it.....
This is Hillary Clinton. We've known her for nearly thirty years. Did anyone really expect her to take responsibility for her failure?
Well, in voting for Trump they did vote for a misogynist so she's not that wrong.

wonder how long before people start adding OBAMA to the talk.  after all, Rice had one boss, Obama.  is it possible to imagine all the things shown so far as not known to O-man?
for me, this a HUGE win for Republicans (not so much Trump)

seems every day some Republican is recusing themselves, dropping out of the fight.  Dems are doing GREAT with a small, rag tag army...as usual.  thank goodness McConnell stopped the bleeding for a day
Gorsuch was Trumps nominee.  It's a win for Trump and the Republican Party.
yes, but (now we're breathing much easier) mostly **R**
Trump is a **R**.  
Good, hopefully we get another pick while Trump is still in office 
kinda.  he's not ideological, but closer to **R** than *D*
I thought there was another seat vacant right now.
I believe it's suspected that there will be but not currently. 
We could have done a better job.

&gt; Social Security is the greatest swindle of the poor ever. A new study by Peter Ferrara for the Committee to Unleash Prosperity shows that the average poor person who works 40 hours a week during his or her working life would retire with a larger monthly benefit and would have $1 million or more in an estate that could be left to a spouse or children at death if they could simply put their payroll tax dollars into a personal 401k retirement account and tap into the power of compound interest.

&gt; Under Social Security poor (and middle class) households leave next to nothing for their kids at death. So Social Security robs nearly every low and middle income family with a full time worker of at least $1 million over their lifetime. What a deal!

This... doesn't make any sense.  If you are dependent on handouts from the government to survive, it means you don't have any surplus income that you can put into a retirement fund.  Social Security is supposed to take money from the rich and give to the poor.  The poorest don't even pay taxes.  So how is SS ripping off the poor?  The poor can't pay for their own welfare benefits, that makes no sense.

60 million for less than 24 hr delay in flights. Sad. We should have turned those runways into gravel. 
The lecturer in the video is talking about the white male suicide rate specifically, how, if it rose, it would help them in the election (because white males are the least Democratic-leaning demographic, I suppose).  He's saying that if more young people and women and fewer white men (there is an overlap with the former) voted then the Democrats would win more.  It's dark humor but not a celebration of white male suicide.  Have you ever been in a statistics class?  This kind of dark humor is normal.  Like once I heard my teacher joke that smokers are laying down their lives for the good of the country because of the enormous tax revenue collected from cigarettes, which he argued more than offsets the costs to society of dealing with smoking-related diseases.

Also the lecturer himself is a white male, so maybe this is self-deprecating.
Not all Trump supporters are racist, but I think all the white racists voted for Trump.

this is garbage of the highest order... the poor depend on social programs just to pay there bills. Imagine no affordable housing projects, no food stamps, no medicare, no school lunch programs, no child care services.... how would any one be able to survive when the median household income in the US is 51 thousand dollars and child care costs is 5k a year per kid? meadian college costs are 24k a year, median rent for a 2 bedroom is 11K? median health insurance costs are 10k? food... utilities... roughly 30 percent of this country uses government programs just to survive...

re: advocates  --  at least they're aborting the right people
Damn
I don't know for certain whether Trump collaborated with "the Russians" (I assume Putin cronies?). But I will say it's the sort of thing Trump would do. Trump has a history of associating with shady individuals.

In the 1980s, Trump had a relationship with a convicted felon named Joseph Weichselbaum. He ran a helicopter company that supplied Trump's casino with helicopters. Weichselbaum was busted for smuggling marijuana. Trump wrote a letter to the judge, praising Weichselbaum's character. Weichselbaum got a reduced sentence.

Another friend of Trump in those days was John Staluppi, who also supplied Trump with helicopters, and was a member of the Gambino crime family.

Now under New Jersey law, casino operators cannot associate with gangsters. Trump was at risk of losing his casino license by associating with these characters. That he didn't get busted is a testament to the incompetence of NJ officials in the '80s. Still, it proves that Donald Trump is not above having relationships with people that the law or custom forbids him from associating with. If Trump once associated with gangsters when he was absolutely not supposed to, it will not surprise me if he had inappropriate dealings with Russians.

spoken like a true champion of democracy
&gt; pushing single-payer not only as the solution to guaranteeing humane health care but as a self-regulating system to rein in spiraling costs

TOTAL crap.  nothing with government in the middle "reins in costs"...never in history.  and as for "humane health care"  the VA debacle shows what a disaster government care is all about
Single payer or something like the ACA is inevitable.  

Health vouchers are fucking useless and the best thing Ryan has come up with so far.  

think about this notion:

if health INSURANCE were illegal tomorrow, health CARE prices would drop 50% almost over night

the only correction I get to that is many think 50% is WAY too low
Private health insurance does not become illegal in most countries with universal coverage.  In Germany they have mandated health insurance w/ private providers and they are currently paying 1/2 of Americans.  

Going further into the free market is reckless, and any plan that is not universal will not be the plan implemented to fix the mess that is the ACA.  There are conservative universal plans.  
Our current health insurance model isn't grounded in free market principles whatsoever.  What we have is government-granted monopolies.

A free market health insurance market would give me numerous options from numerous companies, I have only two companies in my state and some states have only one.

You say going further towards the "free market is reckless", but we aren't even close to it in any way.  If you are going to judge an economic philosophy by using an example that isn't even remotely close to that philosophy, how is that a fair judge of the philosophy?
This. Single payer, individual plans, employer sponsored plans, or whatever is not what's driving the costs: health insurance costs are driven by the cost of health CARE. If you want to drop the cost of insurance, drop the costs of care and increase the competition in the insurance industry (allowing people to purchase across state lines is a start. Allowing small companies in similar industries to pool together in insurance trusts, etc can all help). 

The root of the problem here is that I can become hospitalized tomorrow for an infection that, hypothetically, costs $10k and my insurance company is liable for most of it. The problem is, there is no viable cap on assumed liability for the procedures provided by the hospital. Let's say, hypothetically, during my stay at the hospital I get up to use the restroom, go to sit on the commode, fall off, Sue the hospital for providing a seat that's too slick and not responding soon enough and a slick ambulance chaser takes my case and wins or gets a huge settlement: I have just raised the cost of business of said hospital. We need Tort reform as well.


There's plenty I think that can be done to make insurance more affordable, but I believe much of it lies in lowering the amount that hospitals and care providers are spending in just legal fees.
private health care does not go away in countries with universal health coverage, I have duel citizenship (US and EU/greece) and I have private health coverage in greece as well as the state insurance, the difference is that total coverage for me, my son, and my wife in greece is 130 dollars a month, and that covers top of the line private hospitals, hospital Sweets (Queen size beds, and a bedroom in the hospital rooms), private nurses, in home care, the works.  You can not imagine the difference between here and there.  All your regular day to day doctor visits are free, or almost free (ten dollars for pills, or 2 dollars for saline or some small things like that)  Hell I got laser eye surgery that was deemed cosmetic, at the world renown Athens eye hospital, with one of the best doctors in the world, for 800 dollars, because my private insurance covers 90% of the cost there.
A pure free market solution would see almost everyone over 65 thrown off their insurance.  That is monstrous.  
I didn't say we needed a "pure free market solution".  I simply pointed out that your statement about our healthcare "going further into the free market" is ignorant.  We don't have a free market healthcare system whatsoever, we have a government-granted monopoly healthcare system.

Just so you know going forward, a healthcare market that had free market principles would allow more competition.  Insurance companies could sell nationwide and not just within individual states and individuals could join private insurance groups to decrease their costs rather than buy plans through their employers or suffer the ridiculous costs of private healthcare.  More competition always equals less cost to the consumer.


There is no market for insuring older people at lower prices and many younger people won't buy insurance unless there is a mandate like the ACA, I don't think I'm being ignorant at all, I think you are being naive.  

Exactly how are you going to make the market more competitive than the ACA market?  Cross-state insurance companies?  Impossible, it is an easily won state's rights issue that states can determine what constitutes insurance within their borders, so that is out.  Why the hell should Alabama be able to sell their cut rate insurance in California and cost California taxpayers money when that person goes bankrupt?  How is that a free market?   
Why are you under the impression that increasing providers and competition means older people will no longer be insured?

There are 35 health insurance providers in the U.S., under the ACA I have 2 to choose from.  Why do you think the ACA is a competitive marketplace for insurance?

Interstate health insurance isn't "out" because different states can require different requirements, it simply means that the individual risk pools would be different.  

California wouldn't likely have the same requirements as Alabama so they wouldn't lawfully be allowed to sell "cut rate insurance".  And Alabama wouldn't be selling anything to California, a private health insurer would be selling to people; not the state.  Your example isn't a free market solution, so it's not a free market.

It's very apparent that you have very little to no understanding of what constitutes a free market and how it would apply to health insurance.
Tax spending makes up over 50% of the GDP in Greece, as a citizen of Greece you should know that you are paying much more than $130 a month for insurance.

And Greece isn't exactly the go to model when making fiscal arguments.
i am talking about what is covered by my private insurance, not what is covered by my taxes, or government
&gt;Interstate health insurance isn't "out" because different states can require different requirements, it simply means that the individual risk pools would be different.

That isn't how the cross-state insurance plan by Trump works at all, what are you talking about?

In Trump's plan a backwards state like Alabama could refuse maternity coverage to their citizens, then such an abominable insurance plan would then be able to be sold in civilized, non-traitor states. 

Sounds like you aren't very well read on this issue.  
Where did I mention anything about the plan Paul Ryan put forth?  You're wanting to have a pissing match, I'm trying to inform and teach.  

Instead of opining about things you know absolutely nothing about on a sub that you dont belong on, perhaps you should spend some time educating yourself and asking questions. Just a suggestion.
"The Resurgent:" a "[StoneRidge Group](https://stoneridgegroup.com/)" website:

**"WE SERVE CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT BLEEDING-EDGE CAMPAIGN KNOW-HOW COMBINED WITH AN AVANT-GARDE APPROACH TO CAMPAIGN EXECUTION. Our record speaks for itself. We’re story cultivators, with a world-class technical edge."** 

Funny, it seems that "story cultivators" as a politically correct term for "propaganda." At least that's what I used to call it, but I guess I'm just not progressive enough like the StoneRidge Group. 
To be fair, in the poll that the article is based on, 51% had an unfavorable view of Democrats, but [57% had an unfavorable view of Republicans](http://www.people-press.org/2017/04/17/2-views-of-the-parties/). Really surprising is that a greater proportion of people surveyed thought that *democrats* were better suited to rein in government spending.
Well no shit.  Republicans have a majority in the House, the Senate, the large majority of State House Chambers, all but 17 governorships, and the presidency.  Pretty obvious that Democrats and their platform isn't doing too well these days.
&gt; were better suited to rein in government spending.

Do people not understand what the democrats primary difference is with republicans?  (Tax raises vs tax cuts &amp; budget cuts respectively)
The primary difference between R and D right now is over social issues not government size. Republicans may propose smaller governments but they rarely enact it and constantly increasing military spending doesn't help any.
Ridiculous title. 'About half' =/= 'Majority' =/= 'Americans'. Since 57% also had an unfavorable view of Republicans, shouldn't the title be "Americans Don't Like Republicans"? 

Or maybe "Americans Don't Like Their Governement"?
And yet republicans have a lower approval rating 
I'm guessing they prefer the majorities over a poll.
Probably. Much of that majority was obtained by partisan gerrymandering though. 
Really?  How do you explain them winning all but 17 governorships then?  
A mix of Democratic incompetence, and the simple fact that there are just more small right wing states 
it's kind of amazing.  Obama and his henchmen spent all their time LOADING UP with new damaging regulations.  now, finally, some reversal

I always wonder what kind of cars we would see offered for sale without CAFE regulations
Hummer H4s?
Very uninformative.
If these types of costs where payed for these types of results in any other part of our government heads would roll.  While I personally would like nothing more than to glass every ISIS stronghold, when I think of the costs compared to the results I always say to myself "there are so many other, better uses for that money".
That is an enormous amount of money. So big that you would think they would have some examples.
Wow such surprise, very unpredictable, much shock
Breitbart bwahahahaha!
&gt;A mix of Democratic incompetence

That is the reason.
Don't get this it's a book about why to hate trump 
Yeah it's been happening for a while now. I'm in NY and it's just the status quo - SAD!
medical liability is estimated to be less than 3% of medical costs https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048809/ , hospital and drug costs are over 65%, with other medical at 12% and insurance companies at 4% http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/12/americas-health-insurance-plans/health-insurers-get-small-percentage-overall-healt/ , real reform needs to be in hospital cost controls and drug negotiations.
gasp!

or it's literally because population density is a factor in crime rate.
so packing illegals and violent minority groups into confined spaces is a bad idea
What the heck is happening in Vermont?
Yup. 
Population density is also a factor in Party voting. Coincidence?!
It's almost as if the blue areas are where major population centers are located.

Dumbass.

Crime rates are almost always done per capita. I don't believe that these maps reflect what OP is trying to get them to reflect, but a real map of crime rates isn't necessarily going to have the "also doubles as a population heat map" impression. 
Crime apparently.
Actually their lame attempt of reverse visual ergonomics is what I posted this to point out. 

Thanks by the way for post that.

Anyone who looks the X's switched for O's leaves some thing to be desired. I also like the color shifts.
methinks you don't understand the term "per capita"

"Violent minority groups"
Trump was elected due the lack of public support for the traditional democratic and republic party politics. Republicans held majority in the house and senate yet got nothing done and Obama's policies are an embarrassment to the legacy of the U.S. I also believe that the Democrats not only hold the support of minority groups but of sensitive younger generations.

What it says is this:

&gt; If the above-displayed maps were properly labeled, they would state that an incomplete electoral map from 2016 was similar to a completed electoral map from 2012. Neither of those maps is related to the crime rate. 

What they say is that neither of the maps you posted is based on crime rate. It's not about visuals, it's about wrong facts regarding what these maps were produced to represent, by the people who drew them.
wow - I guess that all the criminals are democrats, and all the law-abiding, virtuous, wholesome, honest, hard-working, good-looking, generous, and tolerant Real Americans are all republicans!
this map is wrong... It has NYC as a high crime area, NYC is the safest large city in the world.  Thats just the most glaring mistake on it.  This map is not crime rate... what does that even mean? what kind of crime? This is obviously made up, and misleading to prove some kind of stupid point that only the most partisan, confused, ignorant america would ever think was real.
wow its actually an electoral map on the bottom, what a suprise that NYC doesn't have higher crime than birmingham lol.  
the bottom one isn't a crime map, its an electoral district map that has been mislabeled.
There is no way this map is correct.  Vermont and New Hampshire are labeled as high crime areas.  Aren't these some of the safest states in the country?

Fake news 
except this the bottom isn't a map of crime, its a 2012 electoral map that was obviously mislabeled on purpose to push some ridiculous political narative.
Colleges have gotten worse and worse.....students have gotten stupider and stupider. It's nice to see republican students standing up to the Liberal snowflakes of their generation  
On what grounds? Free speech rights only protect you from *government* censorship.

This is irrelevant. When [Milo](http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/01/26/chancellor-statement-on-yiannopoulos/) tried this:

The Berkeley College Republicans are not subject to follow the same constitutional free speech protections as the government.

I'm just tickled that after so many times I've heard "a business owner can turn away gays/blacks/atheists and anyone for any reason because discrimination protections only apply to the government" that nobody realizes it also works the other way around.
The parent mentioned [**Per Capita**](http://legaliq.com/Definition/Per_Capita). Many people, including non-native speakers, may be unfamiliar with this word. **Here is the definition:**^\(In ^beta, ^be ^kind)
****
Per capita is a Latin prepositional phrase: per (preposition, taking the accusative case, meaning “by, by means of”) and capita (accusative plural of the noun caput, “head”). The phrase thus means “by heads” or “for each head”, i.e., per individual/person. The term is used in a wide variety of social sciences and statistical research contexts, including government statistics, economic indicators, and built environment studies.

for sure.  and Democrats used to be reasonable people...really, it's true.  you could talk with them and get work done, the people's work

All the middle class needs is the government to quit thinking they know how best to spend their hard earned money.
Well not taxing the first $24k is a good start.
Even though this is clearly wrong and a lie I guarantee this will passed around and seen on my Facebook news feed by a Trump supporter. And their headline will be "the media won't report these statistics"
I don't understand. She mentioned these things in the debates and it was talked about for months leading up to the election. So how was this "hatched" 24 hours afterward?

And planted carter page, manafort, pence, and Flynn? All to support this "fake narrative".

And then convinced Michael Flynn to be the fall guy all to support Clintons narrative?


That would be a good step in the right direction with that North Korean maniac.  His isolation seems to only make him believe he's somewhat powerful and important.
I think they mean they decided to use those as the primary excuses for why she lost rather than excepting the blame themselves. At least that's my take on it.

Sorry but why is this being down voted?
Great can't to see my premium go down......cuz I won't have insurance.
Yes
Bernie Sanders is such a tool and the people praising that dipshit are even worse.  24 million people aren't getting "kicked off" their insurance, they're gaining back the freedom to not be penalized if they choose not to have insurance.

Obamacare is collapsing across the country and something had to be done to fix it.  Is the Republican plan a fix, hopefully it is.  Does it do everything that everyone wants, of course it doesn't. 

But Sanders and the Democrats passed that huge pile of shit known as Obamacare and it's an absolute failure.  Now they're sitting back acting like it was the greatest Law ever passed while ignoring the fact that it's a failed pile of shit.


They won't be penalized and also won't have insurance.  And preexisting conditions will stop a lot of them from being covered again.  

Which is exactly what Bernie says.  Obamacare is broken and needs to be fixed.  The only way to fix it is single payer healthcare.  Which is what Trump admitted when he said Australia has better healthcare than we do.  Guess what they have?  SINGLE PAYER!

Sanders has said from day one that Obamacare doesn't work.  It helped people and also hurt people.  He wants to expand on it and do single payer.  Republicans battled Obama on this.  He wanted single payer and they wouldn't budge.  They accepted Obamacare on purpose because they knew it would fail.  Now all they care about is repealing it so they can win their midterm elections in 2018.  Bernie isn't a Democrat, he's Independent.  He just knew he had no chance to make an impact on anything unless he ran as a Democrat.  I'm not Democrat.  Both parties are fucked and we need an overhaul.  
&gt; preexisting conditions

"insuring" preexisting conditions is not insurance...it's welfare or something else, but it's not insurance
What?
&gt; What?

read it again = what
Obamacare is far from universal healthcare
&gt;Sanders has said from day one that Obamacare doesn't work. It helped people and also hurt people. 

But the piece of shit voted for it didn't he?

The Bill passed the house chicken little, it's not even a law yet.

Study how government works first before you post on a Republican sub.  Your dumb shit only works on the leftist bullshit subs.
He voted to help people with preexisting conditions who couldn't get insurance.  He knew it was flawed though.Yes, I know that.  Would you like to talk like an adult or continue on like a 12 year old?  The only dumb one here is you because of how you're acting.  Why must it always turn into a left/right argument?  Can't we just discuss neutrally?  
&gt;"insuring" preexisting conditions is not insurance...it's welfare or something else, but it's not insurance

Missing a leg is a pre-existing condition that insurance would cover the replacement of a prosthetic if it gets damaged, but otherwise would just get money from the client.  Thus, it is insuring the pre-existing condition.
You don't make any sense.  
You're right.  This is what Bernie Sanders and progressives want and Republicans hate it, but Trump admitted it works and it's better than our current system.  So he made a fool out of himself and the party.  He also showed the American people he lies, yet again.  He even said years ago that this country needs universal healthcare.  Stop believing his lies!
He's not wrong to praise it, it's works amazingly for them.
It would for us as well.
[removed]
So then why do you think he made a fool of himself and what lies do you think he's spreading?
AHCA was designed to make the rich richer.  It wasn't designed to help people.  It's a cruel bill that will hurt a lot of Americans.  
wat
Read up on what it will do before you praise it, lol.  
Obamacare made my premium go from $380 a month to over a thousand a month.  Obama is a lying piece of shit.
Agreed.  That's why I want single payer.  
Why are you being a troll?
when  
acne,
ADD ,
autism ,
asthma ,
celiac disease ,
Down syndrome ,
hemophilia ,
sleep apnea,
headaches,
pregnancy,
and rape,
are all considered pre existing conditions, then you know its a bullshit term that is used as an excuse to not provide coverage for people.  You can't help being born with autism, you can't help being raped, you can't help having asthma... this should not make you ineligible for insurance.  No one should have the right to tell you that because you had acid re-flux your insurance can deny your chemo.  The term is only there to help boost insurance profits, not for any other reason.

No you haven't...
Is &lt;8 years really long enough to make such a claim?
ok
No where does that article say that. What a disingenuous title. In fact:
&gt;  "When you see increases in so many of the leading causes of death, it's difficult to pinpoint one particular cause as the culprit," Anderson says.
First of all the title is complete crap, and chainsaw is just creating click bait.  The article never claims obama care is the culprit, and and the tinniest bit of research would show you that obesity is behind the drop in life expectancy.  Are you claiming obamacare made us fat? The article also blames things like accidental death and suicide.... I guess obamacare is making us more accident prone, and has us killing ourselves too.....
the article doesn't even mention obamacare it says "Most notably, the overall death rate for Americans increased because mortality from heart disease and stroke increased after declining for years. Deaths were also up from Alzheimer's disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease and diabetes. More Americans also died from unintentional injuries and suicide. In all, the decline was driven by increases in deaths from eight of the top 10 leading causes of death in the U.S."  The title page is just garbage looking to somehow blame obamacare....

Wow, you mean to say infowars is about as credible as CNN? Pushing fake news about Obama like, say, pushing that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor? Or how about the Iran deal was the best thing ever? Or how a out actively helping to rig a debate towards Obama's favored candidate? Infowars didn't do anything like that. Not that they're a bastion of integrity, nothing close. Just seems funny that that's how far you have to go.  
  
Also, just looked through your account. I sure hope you're getting paid to do that or it's just sad.
Are all republicans this dumb... I don't get it how is insuring pre-existing conditions akin to welfare... HOW SWAY!!!! 
🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
I agree with the headline but the article itself uses facts very sparingly.  Would have appreciated a more debunking-oriented approach.
logic suffers.  compare other equivalent situations:

1. you don't buy fire insurance until your house is a smoldering junk pile
2. you don't buy auto insurance until after a wreck

clearly, both are untenable...and so is health care coverage

why pay when you can stick others with your bill AFTER the fact?
quit calling Obamacare and Ryancare HEALTH care

it's not.  it's government insurance...at best
why not lie?  if you're a Dem, there are no consequences
This guy is brilliant /s
What about a child with asthma, autism or any mental issue, how does this factor into your logic. HOW SWAY!!
i think the left is blowing things out of proportion, but this article doesn't do anything to defend the new bill.  just an attack on the left and obamacare.  
damn what a child you are
Or the President. The last time we held a President accountable for a lie was Clinton.
so I've reached my NYT limit and took some notes about their article, linked above.  they really expect me to want their "reporting", but here's some of why not:

&gt; the president betrayed his focus on the continuing inquiry into Russia and his aides.

how to they know the president's focus?

&gt; a carefully choreographed effort by the president to create a pretense for a takedown of the president’s F.B.I. tormentor.

geez.  look at these words: choreographed, pretense, takedown

&gt; Many Republicans assailed the president for making a rash decision...

how many?  show me the list/names of the many

&gt; In an instance of bizarre timing and optics, the White House announced late Tuesday night that Mr. Trump...

bizarre.  seems like an opinion word to me

&gt; F.B.I. agents were enraged by the firing and worried openly that Mr. Trump would...

can I have the names?  enraged?  names now !!!

&gt; Mr. Comey is only the second director to be fired in bureau history. President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions in 1993.

I was a little amazed the New York Fake News inserted a sentence of full truth

&gt; Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, argued against it, delaying — but not overruling — the decision.

LOL.  "overruling"  WTF.  nobody overrules the president

&gt;The firing puts Democrats in a difficult position. Many had hoped that Mrs. Clinton would fire Mr. Comey soon after taking office,

woops. another smidgen of truth creeps in

&gt; Mr. Trump has been furious with news stories about his campaign’s ties to Russia.

yea, right, I saw Trump say "I am furious" right there on live TV...geez
Good
naturally, The Chucker (Schumer) was first to the microphone.  but what's most amusing is the multitude of libtards who called for Comey to be fired.  Comey made his "hold on a minute" declaration late October (costing Hillbag the election {or was it the Russians?}) now want a special prosecutor.  they're all simply unglued

Trump is soooo in control...
Trump taking out the garbage.

What I love more than anything is watching all these liberal asshats all of a sudden act like Comey was great, even though they were calling for his head during the election.  Even the leaders of their failed moronic party can't think for themselves.

Good thing Colbert and John Oliver are around to tell these schmucks how they should think.

If this is all planned then Trump is the most brilliant politician alive today.  If it's by accident than he's the luckiest.  How many times will he make the Democrats and their followers look like complete dipshits, I just hope it's a hell of a lot more.

The "liberal asshats" aren't really acting like Comey was great. They seem to be saying that firing the person who is in charge of investigating alleged collusion with the Russians makes it look like a cover-up/power-grab.
Kind of a weird post, but it's great to see the president stregthening bonds with our allies!
Da, comrade.
Except according to numerous Democrats like Feinstein, there is absolutely no proof of a Trump/Russia conspiracy.

I would think that anyone who is remotely political and moderately educated would know that this Russia bullshit is just political posturing and sour grapes over losing.
Trump seemingly with trouble rationalizing object permanence is reportedly angry with the Russian's for releasing these photos as Kislyak was left off the official account of the meeting.   
&gt; Except according to numerous Democrats like Feinstein,

That is a totally disingenuous caveat. 

You don't find anything at all fishy about all of the Russian connections? The finances? The money-laundering allegations? The connections everyone from Banefort to Don Jr has to Putin and various oligarchs? The Russian meddling in the 2016 election? 

As a life-long Republican (first voted for Reagan), I find this cozying up to the Russians very disconcerting and dangerous. It appears that the motives are strictly financial, so it would be greed as opposed to treason, but still....
Russian connections?  Finances?

You're asking if I think it's fishy that a man with a worldwide corporation that does business in the country in question has financial ties and contacts amongst the government?

If so then the answer is no.  No I don't find that fishy whatsoever.

Secondly, how did they meddle in the 2016 election?  The "hacks" weren't hacks at all, they were leaks from within the DNC.  We know this because the organization that released them has stated this very fact numerous times.
It appears that Trump did business with Russians because no American bank would lend him money. So via various shell corporations and complex transactions, his borrowed money poured in via Russia.

As for the "hacks that weren't hacks" ... what do you call it if someone gains access to private e-mails and publishes them?
liberal or conservative, the precedent set by potus  firing an FBI director who is currently investigating there administration is disastrous  for this democracy. Whatever your stance on russia or Emails, you should not be able to fire some one who is investigating you, just because you don't like the way the investigation is going.
There is no FBI investigation against Trump.  The FBI is performing a foreign intelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation like they did with Hillary Clinton.

If you're going to bitch and moan you should at the very minimum know what you are bitching and moaning about.
So international banking which every international corporation on the planet does on a routine basis.

Stupidity.
&gt; As for the "hacks that weren't hacks" ... what do you call it if someone gains access to private e-mails and publishes them?


Stupidity
Most people call it hacking.
It wasn't a hack buddy, it was a leak.  Stop falling for the bullshit.

UK Ambassador Mr Murray said: "I know who leaked them. I’ve met the person who leaked them, and they are certainly not Russian and it's an insider. It’s a leak, not a hack; the two are different things.

Assange said: "We’re unhappy that we felt that we needed to even say that it wasn’t a state party. Normally, we say nothing at all.

"We have ... a strong interest in protecting our sources, and so we never say anything about them, never ruling anyone in or anyone out.

"And so here, in order to prevent a distraction attack against our publications, we’ve had to come out and say ‘no, it’s not a state party. Stop trying to distract in that way and pay attention to the content of the publication."
learn to read, I never said there was an investigation into trump personally, I said his administration.  Michael flynn, paul manafort, and jeff sessions are all under investigation by the FBI at the moment for possible collusion with a foreign power.  All of them served in the trump administration, and his campaign.  pence may also be guilty of lying to congress when he claimed he had no knowledge of flynn talking to the russians.... the investigation is still classified so we don't know if any one else is involved but flynn, manafort, and sessions where definitely mentioned in senate inquiries. 
Murray is a bit of a discredited loon, and Guccifer 2.0 (a Russian entity) claimed responsibility for it. 

US intelligence agencies agreed.

https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national


&gt; your stance on russia or Emails, you should not be able to fire some one who is investigating you

So you're saying some other dipshit wrote that?  It's obvious that you're too gullible and stupid to realize that this Russia nonsense is nothing more than a load of bullshit from the Democrats trying to discredit the Trump presidency.  

Rather than being a fat pussy who's is in a state of perpetual hysteria and consumed by dipshitery, you should just suck it up and hope for the best with our new president and our country.  Stop being such a whiney bitch.
I honestly think this is a good thing. I've always thought it wasn't something that could be forced to change.

You don't see the difference between accept who you are it's ok and fine, you are loved and the things you feel are disgusting, wrong and against progressivism

Yes it's called grade school
Jesus fucking christ. 
Yea I wasn't shown danish desouza documentaries in school but I was shown every Michael moore documentary imagineable, when they brought in the county voter registration teachers would look down and try to sway those that registered republican to at least register independent....yea no propaganda here
I don't believe you. 
That's fine don't have to just know that it is happening on a wide scale to school age kids and even worse in college. The system is fucked and it starts with the teachers that can't keep their political views in their pants
Yeah that's why half the country is conservative and same for college educated people. 
I am always told studies state the more education you completed the more liberal you are 
Yeah that's true, but not to the point of massive disparity, they are usually in 5-10 points of each other. 
WoW! Could you be any more stupid? That was a rhetorical question by the way. Hey, moron, no one is claiming they came up with the Russian hacking narrative, they simply chose to use it as their main excuse for losing the election.

What part of "reveals how Hillary Clinton personally placed blame for her bruising defeat on Russian meddling “within twenty-four hours of her concession speech.” did you not understand, idiot? It doesn't say she came up with it, simply that they place the blame on it.

But wait, there's more. "illustrates how Hillary Clinton furiously blamed her defeat on the FBI investigation into her private emails, Russian interference, and Trump’s supposed support from “white nationalists.” Again, dumbass, nothing said about coming up with it, just simply using it as a scapegoat.

Now, just in case your wee little brain is still confused and unable to process all the big words, here are a few more choice quotes for you to mull over.

"She put a fine point on the factors she believed cost her the presidency: the FBI (Comey), the KGB (the old name for Russia’s intelligence service), and the KKK (the support Trump got from white nationalists)."

"The authors detail how Clinton went out of her way to pass blame for her stunning loss on “Comey and Russia.”

“She wants to make sure all these narratives get spun the right way,” a longtime Clinton confidant is quoted as saying."

"The book further highlights how Clinton’s Russia-blame-game was a plan hatched by senior campaign staffers John Podesta and Robby Mook, less than “within twenty-four hours”
"Mook and Podesta assembled her communications team at the Brooklyn headquarters to engineer the case that the election wasn’t entirely on the up-and-up." "they went over the script they would pitch to the press and the public. Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument." "The Clinton camp settled on a two-pronged plan — pushing the press to cover how “Russian hacking was the major unreported story of the campaign, overshadowed by the contents of stolen e-mails and Hillary’s own private-server imbroglio,” I could continue to beat this dead horse but I think I've made my point.

It should now be painfully obvious to even an obtuse mentally challenged dullard such as yourself that it is no way implied that Hillary created the hacking conspiracy, she and team Hildabeast simply ran with it as the primary culprit to be used as an excuse for her dismal presidential epic fail.

A word of advice, do yourself a favor sugar and get hooked on phonics and learn to read at a 4th-grade level so as to avoid any future embarrassment and spare yourself the shame of making a fool of yourself once more. And thus concludes your lesson. You're an idiot.
What "left" claims would you like to have debunked?

How do you think the "left" isn't being honest about health care?
So paid "protestors" from various leftist activist groups harassed a Republican politician at a townhall.  Better call some historians, this is surely a first.

Fucking morons are yelling questions that have already been thouroghly debunked.  Spend less time yelling and being assholes and more time paying attention, then again they're getting paid to be moronic dipshits so they likely already know that.

How Republicans deal with these asshats day in and day out is truly a mystery.


Why do you assume they're being paid? You seem to think they believe what they're saying, so why? 
I'd give you a good faith response but you put the word "left" in quotes twice when I never used the word and neither did the headline.  
I closed the video the second I saw Pepe on his t-shirt. Please take that crap to The_Donald.
Cartoons can be triggering... Get some play doh and xanax. 
It;s not high treason to ask for information LOL
Didn't Trump ask the Russians to hack Clinton? How is Olbermann a traitor and Trump not?




You do whatever you have to do to justify your non answer man. 
I wonder what they talked about.
Because I actually read the article and it lists the numerous professional activist organizations that went there to protest.  

These people are insane so who knows what the hell they're thinking.  
This is bad. Now people who want therapy can't get it.

FOR THE RECORD, yes, Christians teach that it is a sin to commit homosexual acts. A whole lot of things are sins. We are all sinners, and even the smallest sins will make you guilty before God.

We also teach that Jesus can forgive you and will if you put your faith in him and repent. Jesus can heal the blind, he can raise the dead, and yes, he can cure you of whatever troubles you. While he may not heal you before you die, it doesn't matter. His promise is sure: If you have faith in him and try to repent of your sins, you will be saved!

So Christian do teach that homosexuals are going to hell. We teach that EVERYONE is going to hell, and EVERYONE must repent.

Well shit it's been rewritten so many times at this point, what's one more?

The guy in the video has no idea What the term, Treason means. Olberman is asking for sources to help investigate or clarify Intel. That is not treason. That's right, blame the liberals or far left.

Oops I hope I didn't upset any republican snowflakes 
I actually enjoy it. We haven't heard about men in women's bathrooms, a mass shooting, some cop shooting a drug dealer that pulled a gun on him just because the drug dealer was black. I enjoy the Supreme Court pick, the constant freak outs of liberals it is almost a side show. The fact that you have been trying to get him out of the picture since the primaries and have failed utterly bad. I mean so bad that I take nothing seriously from your guys mouths anymore. Anyhow like I said enjoyable.

How do you like not having the house, senate, governorships, most state legislative branches, presidency and the Supreme Court. As we would say in sports score board
&gt;We haven't heard about men in women's bathrooms

Just like before. 

&gt;a mass shooting

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Cincinnati_nightclub_shooting

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Kirkersville_shooting

http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting

&gt;some cop shooting a drug dealer that pulled a gun on him just because the drug dealer was black

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Jordan_Edwards

Just went back to behind the scenes. Black men still get killed by police all the time. Also "drug dealer."

&gt;I enjoy the Supreme Court pick

Theft.

&gt;the constant freak outs of liberals it is almost a side show

I am gonna wait for the bitch fit when your man-baby gets impeached or he loses in 2020.

&gt;The fact that you have been trying to get him out of the picture since the primaries and have failed utterly bad.

Well your party leaders were the ones that tried get him out during the primaries.

&gt;How do you like not having the house, senate, governorships, most state legislative branches, presidency and the Supreme Court. As we would say in sports score board

Yea well the Democrats had a similar board in 2008 will a much much stronger president. Look where that got us. Good luck with the confidence. Better hope that we don't have those state legislatures during redistricting. 
I am glad both dems and republicans are both on the same side of this issue
[deleted]
Like I said never heard of any of those. It is nice to have a President that does stand on the graves of those victims to restrict Americans rights
    &gt; Implying



It's definitely not a dream they are researching it. Wouldn't the White House counsel's office already know about impeachment since many of the people working there are career bureaucrats who either worked there or were mentored by those working there during Clinton's trial? If so, wouldn't the fact they are researching impeachment mean they perceive the risk is more than just a "dream"? Sincere questions.
Stock market is at a record high, illegal immigration is down, the economy is up, the wall is underway, obama care is getting repealed. Things are great! Winners focus on winning and losers focus on winners. You're focusing on a winner....
&gt; It's definitely not a dream they are researching it.

i researched a trip to austin, texas, but to date it hasn't happened.

&gt; If so, wouldn't the fact they are researching impeachment mean they perceive the risk is more than just a "dream"?

no.
Taking the question in full context, why "no"?
first, you've misunderstood my original comment.  the likelihood of impeachment proceedings against president trump is low.  the media and some democrats have made things appear far graver than they actually are.  so, although the left has been demanding trump's impeachment since he won the election, i think it's nothing more than a dream.

second, i don't think anyone in the trump white house believes the likelihood of impeachment makes it remotely plausible.  that said, if 2018 goes the wrong way, democrats might get a wild hair up their collective ass and try for something (which, i think, would be disastrous for them, but whatever).  so it's good to be prepared.  and that's all i think this is.  

furthermore, i think it's nothing but wishful thinking on the part of the left to believe that simply because the lawyers are looking at it that they think the investigation is going to go against them and they'll be facing impeachment.

the end.
Yeah, seriously, wtf is with this shit
It's a beauuutiful day in Donald Trump' s America! 
Yeah he's just rolling through policy change with control over the whole government. Wait....
After a few short years votes begin to go bad and can rot and stink. Make sure you get the freshest votes every time. Only Monsanto votes have that special ingredient, black box, that keeps your votes fresh indefinitely. 
You realize we are still feeling the effects of Obama's economic policy right? That trump actually hasn't done anything yet? Keep that spin going though!
Lol, Obama's economic plan was terrible. Obama was the first president since Hoover to not have a single year of 3% growth. In order to believe your theory you must believe that Obama planned to stifle our economy for 8 years just waiting for the right time to set his trap. But when? How about just as his biggest political opponent wins in the greatest upset in modern history! Yes! Then I will enact my fool proof economic plan. That's dumb. If Obama had this power why wouldn't he just have made the economy great in the 8 years in which he was in power. Why wait for the first 90 days of someone else's presidency? You know why. It's simply untrue. 



 
Lots of assholes here today
You understand that he inherited a financial crisis and turned it around to reduce unemployment to Clinton era numbers, yes? Or do you only believe what Fox News tells you?
Well, the burden of communicating clearly rests with the speaker.

As far as likelihood, to assess your claim it is low or that certain individuals imply a greater likelihood than exists requires an objective way to quantify that risk. What does your probabilistic model look like?

Additionally, not only the left has been "demanding his impeachment". You overlook the self-identified moderates.

If nobody in the White House thinks impeachment is plausible, why are they researching it? I don't find it plausible I will be crushed by a rhinoceros when I step outside. So, I don't bother researching what to do if I am. Again, given the relatively recent experience of career bureaucrats in the Counsel's office, researching solely to "be prepared" for something that might not even begin to happen for another two years seems unrealistic.
&gt; As far as likelihood, to assess your claim it is low or that certain individuals imply a greater likelihood than exists requires an objective way to quantify that risk. What does your probabilistic model look like?

basing my assessment on historical trends and the absence of any actual evidence of a crime

&gt; I don't find it plausible I will be crushed by a rhinoceros when I step outside.

because democrats being stupid is more likely than a rhinoceros crushing you when you step outside.
So, to put this colloquially, your comment thread here is based on "feels" and not "reals"?
First you said Obama is the reason that Trumps economy is booming. Now, you say Obama's economy wasn't that great because he inherited a crisis. Even though the economy obama inherited(under bush)  had greater growth. So what it is, was Obama's economy so great that it only started to take effect under Trump or was Obama's economy stifled because of what he inherited?  I'll repeat, Obama was the first president since Hoover to not have a single year of 3% growth. The economy grew more, under GW Bush, during the financial crisis than it did under Obama. Obama did some good things but economy wasn't one of them. 
in this case, i think the burden of understanding is on you, since you are willfully misrepresenting my statements.  my comment is based on historical trends.  democrats have called for the impeachment of every GOP president since reagan.  none were been impeached.  furthermore, to date, only 2 presidents have actually been impeached.  there is no evidence of any criminal action nor even anything that suggests probable cause for an investigation of trump himself.  to add evidence of the unlikelihood of impeachment, democrats are starting to pull back from those predictions because they know that if the investigation doesn't turn up anything they will pay for it in 2018.  if it is true that trump's lawyers are researching it, that doesn't make it true that they are expecting it or that it's even likely. 

&gt; your comment thread here is based on "feels" and not "reals"?

i've looked through your post history and in the past you've been quite reasonable, but your latest comment shows me that you'd rather be an asshole.  and now we're done talking.
Actually what I said was Obama inherited a crisis and turned it around to the point where republicans are now trying to claim his progress as a trump victory 
Exactly like 2000-2008, actually... you know - the last time the president was accused of stealing an election, the Democrats and the media promised impeachment daily, they called the president Hitler and couldn't decide if he was an evil genius or a puppet.

How are things in the throes of The New Red Scare? Have you looked under your bed for a KGB troll lately?
Obama got handed a shitty economy do not say he didnt. He did a decent job righting the ship, and getting the country moving again and was rewarded with 8 years for it. Did we get the growth we should have? No. Could he have done better? Most likely

Has trump enacted no what so ever yet, and he has taken over an economy that is in relatively good shape, everyone should agree on that. But you can't say that optimism over his economic policy is not helping growth in most sectors. 

Politics is a pendulum people, it swings back and forth. Your side will never and should never have to long in power.
author posts no last name...I'm not reading
What do you think about Trumps actual policies?
&gt; Didn't Trump ask the Russians to hack Clinton?

Actually, he asked them to release the emails she destroyed if they had them. The same ones the FBI, CIA and NSA promised could never be recovered.

It's a bit different than the way you and Clinton and Democrats portray it.
 Actually he said he would welcome their intervention in the election. 

edit: how you do you feel about Russian intervention in our elections?

Video link is broken. Says the video is unavailable.
It is working for me now 
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-deleted-33000-em/

&gt;"There has never been anything like this," Trump said at the Oct. 9 event in St. Louis. "You get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails."

&gt;Clinton and her campaign don’t dispute that she deleted these 33,000 emails. They argue that these were personal in nature, rather than work-related, and therefore were not necessary to turn over.

&gt;However, they have denied that they deleted the emails after receiving a congressional subpoena from the House Select Committee on Benghazi on March 4, 2015. But an August 2016 FBI report on its investigation shows that Trump’s claim has some merit.


https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html

&gt;“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Mr. Trump said during a news conference here in an apparent reference to Mrs. Clinton’s deleted emails. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”

I understand how you insist this is "intervention in the election". It's the popular New Red Scare talking point.

It's pretty clear he is just calling for the actual emails to come to light. Would that benefit him? Sure.

Others see this as a call for Russia to do the FBI, CIA or NSA's jobs... And a funny joke at that.

At no point does Trump call it an intervention in the election.

An intervention in the election would be actual vote tallies being changed. This is simply politics.

Were you outraged when NBC released the Trump Pussy Tape to try to sway the election? Did you call NBC traitors for "Hacking our election" and demand an FBI investigation into collusion between NBC and the Clinton Campaign?

Or was it OK because you like Hillary and hate Trump?

Be honest!
&gt; At no point does Trump call it an intervention in the election.

It is an intervention however. That he doesn't use the term is not relevant.
Yea...I mean body slamming a dude is sorta wild even for Montana..
Yup, same here. I NOPED right away.

It was a Guardian reporter so you'd really have to stretch the definition of the word 'dude'...
Why does the publication he works for have anything to do with what happened? 
Isn't badgering a politician what the Left would call a "micro-aggression"?
Asking politicians questions is kind of the job of a reporter.
confusing.  Cruz.  Texas.  Oil.  what's not right down the middle?
He should watch "Madame Secretary".. last weeks episode explained why mutual defense is a really good thing.. for the US.
Does he not understand that they don't pay to us? And it is not that they haven't met their commitments, they have to 2024. And while the U.S. does spend 3.2% of GDP on defense we are a global power. So a chunk of that money is in the Pacific and such and irrelevant to NATO.

While it might work in this case using TV and movies to learn lessons is probably a poor choice.

Especially when that entire series was conceived of as an ongoing Hillary campaign commercial. 
I don't really see it that way, but it does actually have some good info in it. In this case, it was very real. In short, mutual defense keeps all those countries from needing to grow their own stockpiles of ever more powerful weapons just to defend themselves.
Was it? I had a Republican friend who loved the show: to her it showed what a good Sec of State could do rather than dithering as Clinton did. 

But as I said, I don't take movie/tv/book stories as somehow telling me truths.
It's better than him quoting Sean Hannity every chance he gets.
No, he does not understand.
&gt; watch "Madame Secretary"

isn't that the show that impersonates Hillary and liberal agenda?
Definitely doesn't impersonate Hillary. There are liberal ideas in it, however many conservative principles as well. It seems rather realistic to tell you the truth.
Why? How many refugees have committed murder in the US in the last 40 years? (Spoiler alert: you'll find the answer is zero.) Now, compare that to the murder spree of that atheist a few years back, the Symbionese Liberation Army, or people citing Trump as justification in the course of a murder? Each one of these killed more people than all the refugees in the last four decades. So, obviously public safety cannot constitute a rational basis for concern. But perhaps you have another reason? (I'm not claiming this other explanation is an invalid one; I just don't know what it would be.)
Wow. This is actually scary with the amount of inflammatory rhetoric. Disagrees all you want with climate change folks but calling them a cult is ridiculous.
I think OP might just be another person conflating refugees in Europe with refugees in North America. In North America we have a lot more control over who gets in, and our vetting is also better.
This essay was really refreshing. It's going to cause massive backlash if the president does renounce climate alarmism, but I think it's probably the right thing to do. 
I don't think the majority of people disagree with climate change specifically, but, you have to admit, climate alarmism is ridiculous in itself and is what most conservatives disagree with. 
every climate article should begin with this **fact**

CO2 = 0.04 **percent**.  0.04% is a thin hair away from zero
Spam hole
Idk I like money but something about having a planet to live on seems like it might be a good thing. These other countries seem to be doing ok by not being so dependent on fossil fuels. Nobody is saying stop completely drilling for oil and mining coal etc but we need to control emissions and waste and shift our energy source to something less harmful. 
&gt; Does he not understand that they don't pay to us?

... If Germany, and Italy, and Canada all pay their fair share - the US can pay less because the funding will be there.

It's real simple and basic math.
&gt; ... If Germany, and Italy, and Canada all pay their fair share - the US can pay less because the funding will be there.

Share of dues? They are. There is no "share" of defense expenses. Don't forget that our Pacific military expenses and our Middle East military expenses count towards our total. Meanwhile NATO countries have an agreement to meet certain goal *by 2024*. Not today, they are not behind today.


&gt; Share of dues? They are. 

Like in the CNN article I just linked you to.

&gt;There is no "share" of defense expenses.

So it's your opinion that Trump just made up the 2% figure?

&gt;Meanwhile NATO countries have an agreement to meet certain goal by 2024. Not today, they are not behind today.

I didn't say anything about them being behind. I said pay their fair share. I understand they agreed to a slow increase over 10 years... It's also fair to say "The last administration's policies sucked, and you should step up to 2% now."
&gt; Like in the CNN article I just linked you to.

You linked it to someone else. That article does not seem to discuss *dues*. They are not "behind" on any dues. You (and Trump) confuse two things: dues to NATO and the guideline for defense pending.

&gt;So it's your opinion that Trump just made up the 2% figure?

It is not a share of defense spending. It is a guideline for what each country is supposed to spend on defense. The U.S. figure includes, as I've said here, spending in the Pacific, spending in the Middle East. It is not just money spent to defend Europe.

&gt;I didn't say anything about them being behind. 

Trump has. He was wrong.

&gt;It's also fair to say "The last administration's policies sucked, and you should step up to 2% now."

It would be interesting to see Trump explain why he wants Germany and France to spend more on their military given how he says that Russia is not a threat.


Yeah you Republicans failed to destroy Obama so I can't imagine how the Democrats could destroy Trump. MAGA! 
Sedition. By definition 
Figured 
[Trump acknowledges climate change — at his golf course](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/donald-trump-climate-change-golf-course-223436)

Despite calling global warming a hoax, Trump warns of its dire effects in his company's application to build a sea wall in Ireland.
Doggerland was a thing, the coasts have always been changing. 
People don't seriously believe this do they?

First, he links to [defyccc.com](https://defyccc.com/brief-summary-of-science-for-the-climate-debate/) for his scientific backup, *obviously* an unbiased site with unparalleled scientific rigor.

Then his whole argument is "Humans have been raising atmospheric CO2 for 150 years now, and agriculture has seen 15% growth improvements because of this, but it's not a problem since CO2 has no effect on atmospheric temperature."

I don't even have to point you to a scientific paper to call this bullshit, just [this guy on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwtt51gvaJQ).  Or maybe [Mythbusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPRd5GT0v0I) if you like, or just do your own Google search, there's a million similar things.

I don't understand how Trump trusts scientists to get humans to freakin' *Mars*, but can't trust those same scientists to tell us what's going on with our own planet.


Just as a point of note, the majority of the votes did not decide the results, the electoral college did.
thats exactly why the electoral college is so important. but she is a pretty map though..
The map is largely irrelevant though. Many of red counties are rural - not to knock on the country folk, but that means low population density. The fact that 5 people voted one way or the other to make the county red in the national scheme of things is irrelevant. Most of the blue counties have extremely high population density - several million people had to vote one way or the other to turn that county a certain color.  

TL;DR - Popular vote?
New rule... whenever using the map above you must attach this map below

Calm your tits, grow a pair of balls and learn to coexist with people who are different than you.
:)
LOL, do you have that bumper sticker?

I coexist with Jews, Hindus, blacks, Italians, Polacks, atheists, and Democrats.

None of them explode.

I have no objection to coexistance.  I object to gas leaks and Islam for precisely the same reason. 
the vast majority of Muslims don't explode however a vast majority of terrorism committed in america (which is ignored by the msm because it doesn't fit in the narrative) was done by right wingers. Only scapegoat Muslims after you hold fellow right wingers accountable. 
Actually, the vast majority of terrorism is committed by left-wing environmentalists, because the FBI classifies any violent action undertaken with political intent as terrorism.  

Which underscores the ridiculous nature of your claim- you go by incidents. So reported hate crimes- what few aren't hoaxes- get reported as "Right-wing terrorism". 

In truth, when it comes to actual terrorism, we can essentially name all the individual right wingers off the top of our heads.  It's bleakly hilarious how desperate the attempted lists of RIGHT WING TERRORISM are.  The last one I saw went back to the 1980s (the last time the KKK killed someone) and included a lot of foreigners like Brevik. 

And what's more- no one supports these people! Who supports Roof?  Or McVeigh?  Or that guy in Portland who appears to have supported every politician on earth at once?  Meanwhile, Salah Abdeslam hid out in Molenbeek for 3 months throwing parties and being protected by the community. 

Which is the issue you're attempting to obscure- the issue isn't some lone wolf.  We can deal with that- we can run down roof and McVeigh toot sweet.  What is shattering the west is the tens of thousands of Muslims who quietly support, or don't disagree with, or only mildly disagree with, mass murdering terrorists. 

That's the real concern. A quarter of them agrees with the exploders.  Another quarter doesn't really care. It's a minority of Salafi Muslims that actually OPPOSE suicide bombing, and many of those oppose it the way we oppose tax increases.  We're philosophically opposed to it, but we're not starting a war. 

So in the end, the issue is not that most Muslims explode, it's that they actively support or don't really oppose the explosions. 
one thing:  why is it that these panel types NEVER hear testimony from "deniers" ?  e.g. as a conservative, I relish doing debate battle with libtards because I always crush them with history, facts and logic.  why not the climate types?  yea, we know why
You do raise valid points however i'll address them one by ine.

1) The majority of left wing eco terrorism dropped off after the cold war ended in 1991 with the fall and discrediation of communism as an ideology. Thd fbi and local law enforcent see left wing terrorism as a low priority and low threat issue.

2) In 2015 71% of police departments across the nation stated that right wing soverign citizens were their largest threat. The second gravest threat were milita groups, while the third was islamic extremeism [1]. President trump has halted all fbi surveillance against the former two groups and only has focused on muslim extremeism [2]. Radical right wing terrorism was of grave concern to the fbi because groups were infiltrating local and state law enforcement which allows these individuals to utalizs the state's monopoly on violance, hence why the fbi opened an investigation on them [3] .
The vast majority of terror attacks in the us (94%) are comitted by non muslims while in europe it's only 2% of attacks are comitted by muslims [4]. 

Furthermore, the overexaggerated threat of muslim extremeism has justified laws that restrct and curtail individual liberities and gives even more power to the state security appratus (The patriot act, the 2012 NDAA, back the blue legiation) and it leaves us vunerable to the gravest terrorist threat in the us.

The vast majorty of muslims are opposed to extremeism and do not condone it (as over 99% of the victims are other muslims). CAIR released a statement condoning the attack in no uncertain terms. The largest reason why most muslims are radicalized are social expectations (engineers are 5x over represented amongst muslim terrorist groups because there is an unfulfilled entitlement complex (economics, neo colonalism, the perception of unfair resource extractio by multi national coorperations as well as globalization plays a factor into radicalization (not a tolerance for violance) [5].

Many right wing leaders for political brownie points justify and endorse attacks against the left and muslims and some who are deranged follow through with said ideology. No one on the national level on the right wing disavowed the attack in portland, furthermore they glamorized and created a persecution complex of many right wingers during the bundy ranch standoff. There is a clear double standard in the media that i would go into but i'm tired of typing on my phone.

Never go full retard.
maybe its because on the one hand you have 197 scientific institutes that agree that climate change is dangerous and man-made https://www.opr.ca.gov/s_listoforganizations.php , and on the other hand you have "the americans for prosperity" and the "heartland group" who are oil PR companies and not scientific institutes.  Even among oil companies the only two who deny it are chevron and Exxon mobil.  BP, Shell, and the Saudis all have come out saying that climate change is real and man made.  The only nation on earth that still believes its not real is The USA, and even here 69% believe in it.  Just because roughly 6% of the planet doesn't believe in something does not mean the rest of the world has to sit there debating them.  The UN represents every one on earth, not the 31% of the one nation that is stuck in non-reality.  Its the same reason they don't bring flat earthers to debate with people who think the world is round.  I know this is harsh, but don't think that its an even debate with large numbers on both sides.  6% of the world does not believe it, and 94% does.  there are no other major political parties on earth who have the stance that climate change is a hoax, and the rest of the world does not want to waste time debating the republican party.

I'm listening to Hannity right now.  this headline is chump change compared with everything that's being revealed, e.g. Comey knew everything and did nothing
I don't know why anyone links to this site.

The site he links to for his scientific backup says straight out that humans have affected the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere, and this is obvious because agriculture has seen a 15% yield increase.

They then go on to say this isn't a problem because increased CO2 concentration doesn't increase warming, when anyone who cares to do a relatively simple experiment (or watch one on YouTube) can determine this for themselves.
Just because we have this map, doesn't' mean we have a good economy. Trump may be in office, but until he actually improves the economy, it wouldn't mean much.
Dude, this was 20 years ago. I think you would struggle to find any scientists now to refute the current evidence that climate change is both happening and man made. 
Why are these two things mutually exclusive?  It's the military and the intelligence services who fight terrorism, and they don't need Trump to do that.  Let's impeach Trump and put Mike Pence in charge.

Are Trump supporters going to keep bringing up terrorism every time Trump does something stupid?
Yeah I question to myself besides the UN being a good place for open international discussion, it doesn't really play out with it's set goal if really doing anything in respect to it's goal: Peacekeeping 
not a great soundbite.
#INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY!
Well, seems like the president was simply trying to get his name clear so that he could advance his agenda. He just didn't use the "Washington" approach. 

Much less obstruction and more of a protocol blunder. 
Yes, but the "pledge loyalty" thing is pretty questionable, as well as Comey heavily implying that Trump encouraged him to drop the investigation into Flynn. Let's see how this plays out tomorrow; I don't think it'll be the impeachable bombshell that liberals are hoping for, but it should at least give everyone more insight into what was going on between these two guys. 
Lieberman (former VP choice for Al Gore) said that Trump never asked for loyalty. We're heading towards a fight between who said what and who we should believe. To be honest, I'm more apt to believe Trump as opposed to Comey. I think his description of Comey as a "showboat" was very accurate.
But how could Lieberman know if Comey states that it was a private conversation between him and the president? Idk, with Comey's relatively clean record in his career, it's going to be hard to hit him about his reputation. Trump will be a much easier target to go at in terms of believing a "he said this, no he said this" scenario. 
Nothing to see there, move along citizen
Nah. If you read through everything that's happening and all of the developments, it's starting to sound as if Trump was truly ignorant of any Russian ties. It's starting to look like Flynn was a solo actor that lied. All Trump literally has to do is pardon Flynn and anything immediately dies legally. There will always be a "cloud" but it is what it is. Impeachment and prosecuting for obstruction of justice (which he hasn't even remotely done) are 100% different.

Its amazing how older republicans who grew up in a time when the minimum wage was a livable wage do not support it now.  It seems like these relics believe the programs were great back when they were the primary recipients, but now that its time to pay for the next generation to benefit from things like this, they claim that it hurts the economy.  
if trump doesnt disapear soon, and we don't reign in his crazy, we are going to wind up losing a lot of our political power.  I get the feeling that a lot of swing states are gonna start turning blue thanks to trump (I know about the democratic history of failing to capitalize on situations like this, so you don't have to bring it up).  I feel like trump has put a large part of the republican base under a microscope and a lot of the rest of us don't like what they see.  
One month old account. Six posts, four of them pro-Trump. Pushing the story that Trump was totally naive about Flynn, who is now being set up as the patsy for the whole administration's Russian involvement.

Found the shill!
So ignorant. You people are just as bad as the people who berated Obama for 8 years. There's no place for you in a civilized society. And it's sorta funny you even mention anything about the age of my account or the number of posts I have. Check yourself 
Honestly I don't listen to anything of this nature as these numbers are coming from the people who said Hillary had a 99% chance of winning. Even assuming that these numbers are accurate, then trump is in a decent position. 
Can you include some sources to back your otherwise baseless claims?
Ummm chill out. Seriously, why are there people like you on both sides of the aisle? Why can't Republicans, Democrats, and Independents just have civil discussions without people like you jumping in and starting calling people "shills" and other bullshit. Grow up, buddy. 
Considering what he's done and said so far, do you really feel Trump is in a decent position, even if approval ratings of any kind aren't a factor?
Wouldn't the FBI just get a subpoena/warrant if it wanted access to the DNC devices? I don't understand why the FBI would ask the DNC for permission if there was evidence suggesting a problem, and I don't understand why anyone would blame anyone else for not volunteering to turn over information to the FBI. This is pretty much how the fourth amendment is supposed to work.
I thought leakers were patriotic now they're traitorous? 
Yes.
it's bull, Trump's "low" rating.  some Trump supporters have dropped off, but betcha 98% are holding firm ...and proudly.  same punk polls that got the election totally wrong.  fuck 'em
Yes when thy reside with the enemy. She hates America 
I know, people like me are so awful. After how nicely Republicans treated President Obama for 8 years you'd think we'd just welcome President Trump with open arms and overlook the fact that he is a lying, dim-witted asshole who is in bed with the Russians. 

Sorry if I've offended everybody, please feel free to ban me if you don't like what I have to say. Also, Happy Comey Day to all!
&gt;you people are just as bad

Bullies hate having the tables turned on them. They suddenly turn into pacifists when they get stood up to. 

&gt;people like you have no place

Stick me in an oven, that'll make your society civilized again. 
I don't disagree with you, seriously I don't. However, a distinct refusal to listen to Republican and middle class voters literally lost the Democrats the election. Instead of complaining about the outcome, why don't people like you join the rest of us in trying to figure out why voters chose Trump, and see if their concerns can be addressed by candidates on BOTH sides of the aisle in the next election. 
Yes I'd give him an 8/10 so far. I think he's done a pretty decent job. Things are looking as they will only get better. 
I see that she's being charged/prosecuted via the same statutes that that LONG list Comey read about Hillary's transgressions.  the usual:  step on the minnow and let the shark free
Can you provide another explanation for how the most wanted man in the world was able to entertain friends and family in his old neighborhood for months without anyone tipping off the police?


 Muslims explode all the time.  No one else explodes.  You claim explosions don't have anything to do with muslims.  Correlation is not causation, true-but its a big damn hint on where to start looking for it.
Except he grew up poor in a shitty Los Angeles neighborhood with poor, hippy parents, so..
I think it was because it had information that had proof that the Russians had gotten into our voting infrastructure, and most people that support Trump dont like the dirt that brings on him.
Do you think she knows she's white?
just about everybody grew up on poor side
People like me already know how Trump won. 

1.  By exploiting the worst parts of the American psyche at his campaign rallies: hatred, fear, greed, paranoia, violence. 

2. By exploiting the 20+ year Republican smear campaign against all things Clinton and all things liberal.

3. By exploiting a weak, lackluster list of primary opponents and abandoning Reagan's Eleventh Commandment.

4. By telling voters anything they wanted to hear, making promises that he had no way of keeping, and hiring a staff to "clarify" his lies after the fact. 

5. By obfuscating his sources of campaign funding and refusing to release his tax returns.

If that's what it takes to win a national election in 21st century America, I hope my team never wins again. I'd rather see a political party die an honorable death than stoop to that level.  
&gt;RISCH: Thank you. All right. So those three things we now know regarding the active measures, whether the president is under investigation and the collusion between the trump campaign and the Russians. I want to drill right down, as my time is limited, to the most recent dust up regarding allegations that the president of the United States obstructed justice. Boy, you nailed this down on page 5, paragraph 3. You put this in quotes. Words matter. You wrote down the words so we can all have the words in front of us now. There's 28 words now in quotes. It says, quote, I hope -- this is the president speaking — I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is good guy. I hope you can let this go. Now, those are his exact words, is that correct.

&gt;COMEY: Correct.

&gt;RISCH: You wrote them here and put them in quotes.

&gt;COMEY: Correct.

&gt;RISCH: Thank you for that. **He did not direct you to let it go?**

&gt;COMEY: **Not in his words, no.**

&gt;RISCH: He did not order you to let it go?

&gt;COMEY: **Again, those words are not an order.**

&gt;RISCH: He said, I hope. Now, like me, you probably did hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases, charging people with criminal offenses and, of course, you have knowledge of the thousands of cases out there where people have been charged. Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or, for that matter, any other criminal offense, where they said or thought they hoped for an outcome?

&gt;COMEY: I don't know well enough to answer. **The reason I keep saying his words is I took it as a direction.**

&gt;RISCH: Right.

&gt;COMEY: **I mean, this is a president of the United States with me alone saying I hope this. I took it as, this is what he wants me to do. I didn't obey that, but that's the way I took it.**

&gt;RISCH: **You may have taken it as a direction but that's not what he said.**

&gt;COMEY: **Correct.**

&gt;RISCH: He said, I hope.

&gt;COMEY: Those are his exact words, correct.

&gt;RISCH: You don't know of anyone ever being charged for hoping something, is that a fair statement?

&gt;COMEY: I don't as I sit here.

&gt;RISCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

----------------------------------------------------

&gt;SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Director Comey, the meeting in the oval office where he made the request about Mike Flynn, was that only time he asked you to hopefully let it go?

&gt;COMEY: Yes.

&gt;RUBIO: And in that meeting, as you understood it, he was asking not about the general Russia investigation, he was asking specifically about the jeopardy that Flynn was in himself?

&gt;COMEY: That's how I understood it. Yes, sir.

&gt;RUBIO: As you perceived it, while he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order, given the setting, the position and some of the circumstances?

&gt;COMEY: Yes.

&gt;RUBIO: At the time, did you say something to the president about, that is not an appropriate request, or did you tell the white house counsel, it's not an appropriate request? Someone needs to tell the president he can't do these things.

&gt;COMEY: I didn't, no.

&gt;RUBIO: Why?

&gt;COMEY: I don't know.

....

&gt;RUBIO: The president's wishes were known to them, certainly by the next day when he had a press conference with the prime minister. Going back, the three requests were, number one, be loyal. Number two, let the Mike Flynn thing go. He is a good guy, been treated unfairly. Number three, can you please tell the American people what these leaders in congress already know, which you already know and what you told me three times, that I'm not under personally under investigation.

&gt;COMEY: That's right.

&gt;RUBIO: We learn more from the newspaper sometimes than the open hearings. Do you ever wonder why, of all the things in the investigation, the only thing never leaked is the fact the president was never personally under investigation, despite the fact that Democrats and Republicans and the leadership of congress have known that for weeks?

&gt;COMEY: I don't know. I find matters that are briefed to the gang of eight are pretty tightly held, in my experience.

---------------

&gt;WARNER: I found it very interesting that, that in the memo that you wrote after this February 14th pull-aside, you made clear that you wrote that memo in a way that was unclassified. If you affirmatively made the decision to write a memo that was unclassified, was that because you felt at some point, the facts of that meeting would have to come clean and come clear, and actually be able to be cleared in a way that could be shared with the American people?

&gt;COMEY: Well, I remember thinking, this is a very disturbing development, really important to our work. I need to document it and preserve it in a way, and this committee gets this but sometimes when things are classified, it tangled them up.

&gt;WARNER: Amen.

&gt;COMEY: It's hard to share within an investigative team. You have to be careful how you handled it for good reason. If I write it such a way that doesn’t include anything of a classification, that would make it easier for to us discuss within the FBI and the government, and to hold onto it in a way that makes it accessible to us.

&gt;WARNER: Well again it's our hope particularly since you are a pretty knowledgeable guy and wrote this in a way that it was unqualified this committee will get access that unclassified document. I this I it will be important to our investigation. Let me ask you this in closing. How many ongoing investigations at any time does the FBI have?

What I find most interesting about this part is it shows the premeditation to use this to go after President Trump and leak his memos to the NYT and argue this in a court of public opinion.

&gt;BURR: Director, is it possible that, as part of this FBI investigation, the FBI could find evidence of criminality that is not tied to the 2016 elections, possible collusion, or coordination with Russians?

&gt;COMEY: Sure.

&gt;BURR: So there could be something that fits a criminal aspect to this that doesn't have anything to do with the 2016 election cycle?

&gt;COMEY: Correct, in any complex investigation, when you start turning over rocks, sometimes you find things that are unrelated to the primary investigation that are criminal in nature.

So then is it fair to say that once you start investigating, you can just keep investigating until you finally find something to prosecute?

&gt;KING: With regard to your memos, isn't it true that in a court case when you're weighing evidence, contemporaneous memos and contemporaneous statements to third parties are considered probative in terms of the validity of testimony?

&gt;COMEY: Yes.

Too bad they didn't explain why that is.

&gt;COTTON: Let me turn to a couple statements by one of my colleagues, Senator Feinstein. She was the ranking member on this committee until January, which means that she had access to information that only she and Chairman Burr did. She's now the senior Democrat on the FBI Committee, which means she had access to information that many of us don’t. On May 3rd on the Wolf Blitzer show she was asked “Do you believe you have evidence that in fact that there was collusion between Trump associates and Russia during the campaign? She answered not at this time. On May 18th, on the same show, Mr. Blitzer said, “The last time you came on this show I I asked if you had seen any evidence that Russia had colluded with the Trump campaign." You said not at this time. Has anything changed since we last spoke? Senator Feinstein said no, it hasn’t. Do you have any reason to doubt those statements?

&gt;COMEY: I don't doubt that the Senator Feinstein understood what she said. I just don't want to go down that route anymore because I'm — I want to be fair to President Trump.I am not trying to suggest something nefarious but I don't want to get into the business of not to this person, not to that person.

&gt;COTTON: On February 14th the New York Times published the story, the headline of which was “Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence.” You were asked if that as an inaccurate story. Would it be fair to characterize that story as almost entirely wrong?

&gt;COMEY: Yes.

&gt;COTON: Do you have — at the time the story was published, any indication of any contact between Trump people and Russians, intelligence officers, other government officials or close associates of the Russian government?

&gt;COMEY: That's one I can't answer sitting here.

&gt;COTTON: We can discuss that in the classified setting then

----------------

&gt;COMEY: That's not — even if I remembered clearly, that's not a question I can answer in open setting.

&gt;HARRIS: Are you aware of any questions by Trump campaign officials or associates of the campaign to hide their communications with Russia officials through encrypted means?

&gt;COMEY: I have to give you the same answer.

&gt;HARRIS: In the course of the FBI's investigation did you ever come across anything that suggested that communication, records, documents or other evidence had been destroyed?

&gt;COMEY: I think a got to give you the aim answer is because it would touch on investigative matters.

&gt;HARRIS: And are you a wear of any potential efforts to conceal between campaign officials and Russian officials?

&gt;COMEY: I have to give you the aim answer is.

I think Siri is changing "same" to "aim"...

And that is all 5 times the word "evidence" was used.
Have a good day, idiot.
Perfectly normal banter.
Definitely, for politics these days.  No bar too low, right?
what about McConnell's Senate?  zero legislative output, e.g. repeal Obamacare plus McConnell says stuff like "I don't know if we can pass tax reform.  not enough votes"
So, science.
I hate electronic voting.  it's been abuse and error since Day-1.  paper ballots are better/safer
The Strange Origins Of The GOP Ideology That Rejects Caring For The Poor [No, that’s not what Jesus says.] By Jack Jenkins - Jun 9, 2017

The ongoing Capitol Hill brawl over health care and budget cuts is getting Biblical.

In recent months, GOP lawmakers have taken to spouting Christian scripture to defend conservative fiscal policy and their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. 

The first example came from Rep. Roger Marshall (R-KS), who argued in early March that Jesus would support his criticism of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, as aspect of health care reform that extended insurance coverage to additional low-income Americans.

“Just like Jesus said, ‘The poor will always be with us,’” Marshall told Stat News, quoting the Bible. 

“There is a group of people that just don’t want health care and aren’t going to take care of themselves.”

He added that “morally, spiritually, socially,” some poor and homeless people “just don’t want health care.”

Marshall’s comments triggered a flurry of criticism from several sources, including more progressive faith writers who chided him for rebuking the traditional Christian instruction to help the poor regardless of their personal choices. 

The newly elected congressman eventually walked back his remarks a few days later.

“Just like Jesus said, ‘The poor will always be with us…There is a group of people that just don’t want health care and aren’t going to take care of themselves.”

But it wasn’t long before another lawmaker spouted a similar argument in a policy debate. 

Later that month, Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-TX) attempted to use scripture to justify increasing work requirements for unemployed adults who use food stamps. 

When a representative from a Jewish anti-hunger advocacy group cited a passage from Leviticus to argue that poor people who receive benefits should not be judged by constrictive work requirements, Arrington fired back with a line from the New Testament.

“Scripture tells us in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3:10…‘for even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: if a man will not work, he shall not eat,’” Arrington said. 

“And then he goes on to say ‘we hear that some among you are idle’ … I think it’s a reasonable expectation that we have work requirements.”

These statements from Arrington and Marshall are rooted in the same religious idea: that the poor and sick — or at least a subset thereof — supposedly deserve their plight, and healthy and more financially secure Americans shouldn’t be forced to care for them.

This theology has incensed many progressive Christians of late, but it didn’t appear overnight. 

It’s the result of a decades-long campaign by conservative lawmakers, intellectuals, and theologians to craft a theology that rejects longstanding Christian understandings of society’s needy. 

As debates over the budget and health care continue to escalate, it’s worth investigating the strange origins of the belief system being preached from GOP podiums.

An Ancient Scriptural Debate

For many Christians, debates about the poor and their choices are as old as scripture itself. 

The God of the Hebrew Bible — i.e., the Old Testament — is often inflicts illness and economic despair on those who reject the Almighty, and prophets such as Moses preach dire warnings against disappointing God.

“The Lord will send upon you disaster, panic, and frustration in everything you attempt to do, until you are destroyed and perish quickly, on account of the evil of your deeds, because you have forsaken me,” a passage from Deuteronomy reads. 

“The Lord will make the pestilence cling to you until it has consumed you off the land that you are entering to possess.”

Yet this concept — that self-righteous immorality begets earthly woes — was either rejected or complicated in the New Testament by none other than Jesus himself. 

When Christ is asked by his disciples how a blind man was afflicted with his condition, for instance, he dismisses earthly concepts of sin-borne illness.
The passage reads:

As [Jesus] walked along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 

Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God’s works might be revealed in him.”

Jesus then proceeds to heal the man, implying that “God’s works” are both his actions and, perhaps, the actions of those who heal the sick.

The tension between these two divergent concepts led to a number of different Christian teachings over the years. 

While many interpreted scripture to mean that all poor people should be served, others delineated between “deserving” and “undeserving” poor.

The Religious Right And The "Undeserving Poor"

American views on the morality of the poor have evolved over the years. In the 1800s, poverty was seen as a moral failing, but that attitude changed drastically around the turn of the century as the Industrial Revolution took hold. 

Bettering the lives of poor — especially factory workers and children — became a rallying cry for Christians who ascribed to the “social gospel” movement popular in the early 1900s, and mass unemployment during the Great Depression complicated tidy definitions of the undeserving poor. 

Then, sweeping social programs created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal cemented a national system — and an ideology — that sanctioned relief for those in need (regardless of their personal choices), which President Lyndon B. Johnson built out with 1960s-era anti-poverty initiatives.

But mindsets began to shift as the 20th century wore on, and there’s strong evidence that right-wing Christian figures helped craft a form of “biblical capitalism” to counter the views of religious progressives.

In his 2014 book The Undeserving Poor: America’s Enduring Confrontation with Poverty (originally published in 1989), author Michael Katz argues concepts of the “undeserving poor” reemerged during the ascendancy of the Religious Right in the 1970s. 

When conservative Christian leaders began outlining their agenda, he writes, they targeted programs like welfare because they “believed [the system] weakened families by encouraging out-of-wedlock births, sex outside of marriage, and the ability of men to escape the responsibilities of fatherhood.”

Rep. Paul Ryan has made several theological arguments to defend cutting welfare programs in recent years. 

Citing sociologists, Katz notes that by the early 1990s — around the same time as their cause fused with the institutional conservative movement — right-wing Christian leaders were willing to work against some of their own churchgoers when it comes to anti-poverty initiatives.

Why? 

Because, Katz says, the “economic fortunes” of prominent pastors relied less on government spending on programs that “poor fundamentalists might desire.”

This eventually sparked something of a cottage theological industry where thinkers concocted faith messages that couple the idea of “undeserving poor” with a passionate support for free-market capitalism. 

In addition to scores individual theologians writing over the course of decades, issue-specific groups such as the American Enterprise Institute’s (AEI) Values and Capitalism project or the Institute for Faith, Work, and Economics (IFWE) sprung up to espouse a conservative and libertarian economic theology primarily geared toward evangelical Christians.

Sociologist Paul Froese at Baylor University — a Baptist school — observed this emerging phenomenon in 2012, describing it as a “new religious-economic idealism,” or the “belief that the free-market works because God is guiding it.” 

He pointed to survey data reporting that Americans who feel “God has a plan” for them and their nation are far more likely to think that “able-bodied people who are out of work should not receive unemployment checks.”

“Perhaps it is the fervent individualism of American Christianity which makes free market capitalism seem like a Divine mandate,” Froese wrote. 

“Because evangelicals assert that you alone are responsible for your eternal salvation, it makes sense that the individual is also responsible for his or her economic salvation without government assistance, especially if God is the only assistance you really need.”

The impact of these efforts was on full display during a 2014 panel discussion at AEI, where speakers debated “a Biblical answer to poverty.” 

All four panelists — two from IFWE — championed the merits of traditional capitalism, and IFWE Vice President of Theological Initiatives Art Lindsley drew upon a book chapter he wrote entitled “Does God require the state to redistribute wealth?” 

He argued that modern concepts of jubilee — a practice referenced in the Bible and traditionally interpreted to be a period of debt forgiveness in ancient Israel — are inaccurate, and insisted that early Christians did not sell all of their possessions (despite the fact that, according to the Bible, Jesus explicitly asked them to).

“I think we would all agree that there is a place for government, a place for the church, a place for nonprofits — but there’s also a place for markets,” Lindsley said....

Ugh.  Tons of deflection, and very little substance.  I wish this article had substance.
Folks all over talk like Trump's got no plan. They say "where are the specifics?" "How are you going to do all of this?"

This is how. It's 20 minutes long, it's boring, and it's anything but glamorous. People won't watch it, but it's what the answer to those questions look like. It's not a PR campaign, it's a real plan.

As a former government manager, I understand what he's talking about. The needless paperwork is part of the reason I left.

What was left unsaid in Trump's speech is that these bazillion page studies go UNREAD. Projects labeled as "must pass" get passed even when known issues exist, and the documentation is so redundant and daunting that nobody reads them unless they plan on filing suit, and have an axe to grind, regardless of how safe, sound, and necessary the project is.

The biggest part of the reason I left the public sector was the fact that these regulations, as daunting as they are, didn't do their job. As I said before, exemptions were ALWAYS given for certain projects-- and we managers wound up getting skilled in getting exemptions rather than ensuring safety. When I realized that was the bulk of my job (circumventing protections), and that my red flag waiving just hurt me more than it helped, I left for the private sector.

If we had a 10-100 page document instead of a 100,000 page document to outline a projects liabilities, people would read it and be made aware of critical issues. 

Thanks, Mr President. I cannot wait to be proud of the work we've done.
well and good.  **but** the REAL point is responding **at all** to fake "science" and false data is absurd 

even Trump is shy to say, "no, no, no way...that's all garbage"
he'll have a good meeting, he'll be sincere, and they'll all go back and stab him in the back when they're interviewed.
Amen
This is so tragic. Im sure he is in the best hands, my heart goes out to his family.
one apparent benefit of this shooting is both the lame streamers and Dems have toned WAY WAY down.  I know it won't last, but seeing themselves potentially shot has made a change
What? Wouldn't you say both sides have put politics aside?
seems NYT is back at it already today Trump bashing
What a load of garbage. Climate research is not an exclusive topic for the US. Independent researchers *worldwide* come to the same conclusions, so even if the US had replaced all their honest researchers with a bunch of impostors, this would have been noted elsewhere.

This is akin to saying the moon landing was a hoax and thousands of people at NASA all kept their mouths shut. Yeah right...
Yap, really
Moon landing happened.  Dangerous Anthropogenic Global Warming / Climate Change does NOT happen.

[More than 1,000 International Scientists Dissent](http://www.cfact.org/pdf/2010_Senate_Minority_Report.pdf)
lots of mechanical engineers, physicists and chemists on your list... very few climate scientists.  And the planetary consensus is that climate change is real.... the republican party is the only political party in the world who dissents.  The Paris accords where signed by every other nation in the world....  even 40% of republicans agree climate change is real.  you have the whole world on one side of the equation and the republican party on the other..... you can keep thinking how you want, but public opinion the world over has moved to the other side of the argument.  Even shell, BP, and the saudis agree that climate change is real and caused by man.  
That's not a very scientific attitude to say that a theory confirmed by thousand independent scientists has "collapsed" because of one report to the contrary.

It's good and healthy that opposing views are published. Great job. Now this paper and its conclusions will be reviewed and critiqued or confirmed.

But no theory has "collapsed" on the account of one person just saying so.
Yes yes, the infamous document were hardly anyone on it is a climatologist. Pull your head out of your ass.
Does one have to be an astrologer to conclude that astrology is pseudo-science?
Mechanical engineers, physicists and chemists on one side.  "Climate scientists" on the opposite side.  Who is right?

A hint: which sciences gave us aircraft, cars, computers, electrical grid, aspirin etc.? Which side gave us only vague or fake prophesies?
Right. This theory did not collapse, because it never had standing.  CAGW has always been environmentalist propaganda artifact.
You don't understand how science works.
Go ahead, explain me.
Scientific theories are tested again and again and again and again, all over the world, by different scientists. When the results are the same, or similar, a consensus is built. Not a conspiracy. Not a secret cabal. Indeed, each experiment is carefully documented. 

One study opposing the consensus simply doesn't disprove it. And likely won't. But, because science is science, and not the crazy ravings of some internet talk show host, other scientists will replicate the experiment. If enough contrary evidence emerges, a new consensus is achieved. Viola.

You can also apply Occam's razor. What seems more likely? That thousands of scientists from all over the world, of different religions, different nationalities and working at different, competitive labs, Universities and government institutions are all involved in a massive cover-up 30 years in the making and no one has leaked, OR that the petrochemical industry has engaged in a huge smear campaign to protect their profits? Bear in mind that EXXON recently came clean about both knowing about global warming in the 1970's and funding crackpot labs to publish disinformation (think Big tobacco).

I leave it to you.

This is not what happens in the so-called "climate science".  To begin with, "climate scientists" refer to the computer model runs as experiments.

"The consensus" does not exist! See [NIPCC](http://climatechangereconsidered.org), [WUWT](https://wattsupwiththat.com), [ClimateDepot](http://www.climatedepot.com), or [search realist climate websites](https://defyccc.com/search).

Scientists have been shouting out loudly about [corruption of the scientific process](https://defyccc.com/search/?q=corruption+of+scientific+process) in the so-called climate science.  Some of their cries even trickled down into the formerly mainstream media.  But it was drowned down by the leftist academia, Big Green, the European Union, and, in later stages, by the Obama administration.

&gt; OR that the petrochemical industry has engaged in a huge smear campaign to protect their profits? Bear in mind that EXXON recently came clean about both knowing about global warming in the 1970's and funding crackpot labs to publish disinformation (think Big tobacco).

This is a conspiracy theory.  Exxon did not come clean, because it had nothing to hide.  Exxon also supported carbon tax.
Well, clearly facts won't sway you. Nipcc and all those other studies? Funded by big oil. Hey, did you know that smoking is both non-addictive and proven to improve your circulation? 
 
Conspiracy theory and red herring fallacy.
The account you are responding to does nothing else on reddit except post fraudulent, anti-AGW-spun pseudoscientific rhetoric. You can't persuade them; this is their job.
From my previous comment-

An article written over a year ago, never cited by anyone else. An author, Kyoji Kimoto, who lists as his institution Mirane Corporation, about which I can find no information. (Of course these aren't enough to completely dismiss this paper, but it should make you skeptical.)


The article itself starts by discussing the importance of coal, suggesting this paper is aiming to keep coal as a legitimate power source. It's arguments are (1) somebody didn't perform a sensitivity analysis on the temperature lapse rate with height in atmosphere when calculating the climate sensitivity before forcings are included, so all those results are claimed to be meaningless; and (2) there was a mathematical error in a paper from 1976, never mid the fact that empirical evidence largely agrees with the 1976 calculation.
The general way science works is someone(s) constructs a model to explain observed behaviour. The model which best predicts observed phenomena and which makes additional predictions to test, over time, becomes the predominate one. In the case of AGW, a model must accurately track recorded data and predict temperature trends within a certain margin of error.

Now, maybe you (or this researcher) have a better model. Maybe you don't. The way to differentiate is to see what this alternative model says we should have seen for temperatures and what we will see going forward. Do you have that data? (I ask sincerely.)
so out of 110 million people in stem fields in the world you found a thousand that agree with you, and you think this is significant?  109,999,000 on one side and 1000 on the other, and you think this puts you on the winning side? can you maybe name me one scientific body that agrees with you? heres 198 that don't https://www.opr.ca.gov/s_listoforganizations.php. , oh thats right, I forgot, the only two groups left are owned and funded by chevron and Exxon-Mobil, and its not like they would have a reason to lie.  As far as I can tell, the argument is over, its a small group of people funded by two oil companies, and coal on one side, and the entire world on the other.
Can you explain your background?  You do nothing but post anti climate change stuff on reddit and you tried to convince me CO2 was good cause its plant food
Your analogy isn't working. 

&gt; Does one have to be a ~~astrologer~~ *climatologist* to conclude that ~~astrology~~ *climatology* is pseudo-science?

You're suggesting that the field of climatology is pseudo-science, rather than a theory it has developed.

So yes, you need to be a climatologist to argue for/against a proposition made *in* climatology.
Astrology is also a developed field.  My argument is that whether climatology is a scientific field is in question.  To be deemed science, climatology has to show that it make testable assertions and these assertions are not shown false in experiments and observation. "Climatology" has failed this test, so it is pseudo-science.  Opinion of proven scientists and engineers confirms this conclusion.
&gt; My argument is that whether climatology is a scientific field is in question. To be deemed science, climatology has to show that it make testable assertions and these assertions are not shown false in experiments and observation.

No, it has to show that its *theories* (i.e., the models that explain observed climate conditions) can make proper predictions etc.

&gt; "Climatology" has failed this test, so it is pseudo-science. 

That assertion is simply not true. 

&gt; Opinion of proven scientists and engineers confirms this conclusion.

Opinions of scientists from completely random fields (as per your link above, some of these are actually MDs) is neither *peer*- nor proper review. The opinion of a neurosurgeon on a paper about filtering algorithms in computer graphics for instance is completely irrelevant, because the neurosurgeon has no insight into this field.
&gt;  tested again and again and again and again, all over the world, by different scientists. When the results are the same, or similar, a consensus is built

OK, but how does any other result come into play?

&gt; One study opposing the consensus simply doesn't disprove it

opposing?  one side or the other must not be science because science does not oppose.  it's true or it's fake

fake like the tons of proven bogus data injected to support climate claims.  btw, you won't get a $$$ grant for anything unless you're on the band wagon of doomsday yelpers
Bullshit. Conspiracy, conspiracy, conspiracy, dem librul scientists! Does it occur to you that a. Not all scientists are dems, or even americans? and b. Yes, scientists CAN hold opposing views?

How do you account for EXXON confirming that man made global warming is true, and they've known about for 40 years?
Eh, as a Jew in the midwest I have a lot more to fear from the average Christian than the average Muslim. The guy who punches me in the face for wearing a kippah will have the same skin color as I do, which is a relatively pasty white.
And this happens-when, exactly?

It seems odd.

Either you, in a country with freedom of movement, choose to live in shrieking terror of imminent Kippah slaughter, or this is something that never happens ever to anyone, and youre worrying about meteor strikes.


Or alternatively, you're choosing to perpetuate lies about Christians for reasons mysterious.
Well I am a Jew after all. What are we if not lying Christ murderers? ;)

It was hyperbole demonstrating the intolerance I face on a daily scale is from my Good Christian Neighbors and not Dr. Amit who closes her door briefly to pray every afternoon. She could not give a literal fuck if I am a Jew. Her lovely nurses, however...and there are far more of them than there are of either Dr. Amit or me.

I believe elsewhere you accuse others of using the, "You don't like it, so move!" defense far too often. I'm here for med school. I chose to apply out here thinking that perhaps my Jewy, Jewy perceptions (say it with the appropriate Lewis Black intonation) of the average nice Midwestern Christian lady were wrong. Experience, alas, has taught me otherwise. You know enough of med school applications and the rigidity of acceptance to know why I did not just punt.

Can you remind your fellow Christians that if you're going to shove "Judeo" in front of "Judeo-Christian" values that you shouldn't be such audibly raging anti-Semites in front of us? 
We had a fuck ton of global warming and cooling before humans came around... but we're so self-centred that we think we're the cause of everything.
&gt;Well I am a Jew after all. What are we if not lying Christ murderers? ;)

Maybe don't brag about that if you want christians to like you.

&gt;It was hyperbole demonstrating the intolerance I face on a daily scale is from my Good Christian Neighbors and not Dr. Amit who closes her door briefly to pray every afternoon. 

Oddly enough, the well established, could presumably get a job somewhere else or back home Muslim is not on here bitching about their treatment, but you are. 

Mebbe try not being a dick.

&gt;She could not give a literal fuck if I am a Jew. Her lovely nurses, however...and there are far more of them than there are of either Dr. Amit or me.

Yes, nurses are widely known for their institutional anti-semitism.

&gt;I believe elsewhere you accuse others of using the, "You don't like it, so move!" defense far too often.

No? But when I do, it's a discussion of large scale policies of debate, not specific threats to my life. 

&gt;I'm here for med school. I chose to apply out here thinking that perhaps my Jewy, Jewy perceptions (say it with the appropriate Lewis Black intonation) of the average nice Midwestern Christian lady were wrong. 

Who?  

Pro-tip, pal, if you're trying to sell people on your awful anti-semitic experiences, maybe not go to a place where the most common religious experience is one that unconditionally celebrates Israel and international Jewry.  Trying to sell me on the idea that modern evangelicals are raging anti-semites might work if I hadn't gone to some of their churches. 

&gt;Experience, alas, has taught me otherwise.

After reviewing YOUR posting history-A. for a med schoolstudent, you have lots of reddit time.  B.  You're endlessly whiny and arrogant. Also, endlessly running down Christianity. Maybe it's not your religion, it's you.

&gt;You know enough of med school applications and the rigidity of acceptance to know why I did not just punt.

Med schools, nurses, and Doctors- THE NEW FACE OF THE KKK.

&gt;Can you remind your fellow Christians that if you're going to shove "Judeo" in front of "Judeo-Christian" values that you shouldn't be such audibly raging anti-Semites in front of us?

LOL lemme guess, someone told you you'd go to hell for not believing in Christ and ITS ANOTHER SHOAH. 

And for a guy who lives in fear of imminent violence by.....nazi nurses, apparently, you such at shutting up and keeping your head down.  Almost like Fraulein Nursenfurher wasn't about to run you down like a dog. 

Get over yourself, and keep your fetishes private. 
My my my. So defensive.
The problem is our data collection was jack shit until very recently, much like the perpetual state of the liberal mind. It hits 90F here in May and they start screeching about global warming.
Gotta say, the adult man crying about his incipient bullycide by midwestern church lady nurses probably doesnt want to start commenting on personal traits
the guy is a nut who spends all day posting anti agw nonsense.. why would you try to argue with him?
I wonder how many lists we can make like this, for every person in the public eye?
I do NOT condone even imagined violence on someone.  I just wonder, for scientific curiosity, how frequent this phenomenon is for everyone.
That's common for most presidents. Ulysses S. Grant was viewed unfavorably for the longest time and it took forever for people to finally reflect fondly on Dwight Eisenhower's presidency. 
Yeah even Jimmy Carter these days at least is perceived as an honest good person. It just shows once all the bitching stops and people settle down we realize that it's an impossible job and no one can please everyone.
how many ways are there to spell LOSER?
Laugh now but this is going to push the social democrats further into prominence.  
When Democrats act like idiots, feel the repercussions of acting like an idiot, but still refuse to admit fault, this is what happens.

Maybe everyone will learn form this?  Probably not. though.

This was actual anti-fascist work being done, not the antifa "everyone I disagree with is a fascist" approach to protesting stupid stuff.

Im not sure what the issue is exactly, can a mod help explain?
I am a democrat and fuck those people I have liberal viewpoints but believe in moderate solutions. Those people are just mad because they have been mislead that they  are the gods of their world by other idiots like themselves. I am firm believer in free speech even when it's offensive to me. Antifa needs to be ignored and it will go away eventually. A movement is only as powerful as the people willing to listen.  
See, people aren't as divided as everyone is led to believe, it's just idiots throwing apeshit at each other instead of just disagreeing. That's all that's ever put on the news, so that seems like the norm. 
They think Trump will be influenced just by having his name on something? That's ridiculous!
is this a matter?
Lol. Look over here! Don't look at all the silly reports on investigations regarding the elected President of the United States and his colleagues! Instead look at a 70+ year old senator that has little influence in a GOP majority Senate... 
The reports are just that: silly. It's obstructionism and nothing else. Total trash. 
pro-communist politician UNDER INVESTAGATION WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?!?!?!?!?!
The reports on Russian collusion? Almost certainly that's "total trash".

The reports on Russian's trying to influence the election last year? That's accurate, and is something GOP and Dem senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee are openly concerned about and want to understand. 

The reports on President Trump going at length to try and stop investigations on people in his administration? It appears those aren't false, although the desired consequences for those actions differ from citizen to citizen. 
Should the F.B.I. not investigate Bernies wife for fraud and not investigate Bernie for his roll in it?  Why are they exempt from being investigated and what may turn out to be a prosecution?

Also, what does an investigation that was started under the Obama Administration have to do with President Trump?


He's not communist at all stupid sheep. He cares about the middle class unlike the stupid fatass president who only cares for the rich to get richer 
Trump the fatass fuck
Fox News is lies dumbass cocksucking sheep

I like how Democrats are acting like Obamacare isn't a colossal failure, it really shows how little they actually care about the American people.
lol is this a joke? Ammonia is a byproduct of the human body, but concentrate enough of it in your water supply and you'll have a bad time.
CO2 is caused by humans breathing. Michelle Obama wanted Americans to move more so we'd breathe more, thereby putting more CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore, the Obama's conspired to cause global warming!
For real though, reading this site needs to come with a tinfoil hat. 
Global warming is an Obamanese conspiracy to make our children less fat.
because it isn't.
more people have healthcare than ever before.

the problem is the way capitalism profits more from treatment rather than results.

resulting in a health care system that doesn't necessarily seek to heal but rather delay. Which increases costs I.E. "profit"
of course.  now test your mettle and post that at /r/politics :-)
CO2 = 0.04 **percent** of our atmosphere and is essential for life on earth

there is zero evidence of any harm
0 evidence of any warming effect?
Obamacare is collapsing, if you don't know this you are either paying absolutely no attention or you only read far left bullshit.  Entire markets have collapsed leaving no insurers.  

Our healthcare system isnt even remotely considered a free market solution so where are you getting capitalism is to blame?  Hint:  when you only have 2 choices for health insurance, the free market isnt anywhere to be found.
it's collapsing because it's a capitalist based system.

Capitalism has no place in education, environmental, health, or justice systems.

profit and greed corrupt it far far too much to the point that it inevitably collapses every time.

How is the government subsidizing an industry with taxpayer money while forcing people to buy a product they don't want considered capitalism to you?

Obamacare is nearly the exact opposite of capitalism.
God is real. He loves everyone. *points at starving children in 3rd world countries *

I'm not sure how to do that my bad 
Sounds like climatic temperature was a phrase coined in the 50s. Like lots of thoughts and ideas in science it is no longer the standard. Climate change is very real, out of the top 10 hottest years they are all since 1998. Funny enough the "climatic temperature" to present contains all 10 of those hottest years. 


Not sure if the articles premise was "they don't use this phrase when describing climate change so they aren't real results" or something else. Seemed a bit straw man-ish.




By opposing he means finds results in conflict with the majority. Poster further up in the comments made a lovely response, would recommend reading that one. 

To sum it up the likelihood this was an error is high, though other labs will likely try to replicate it as long as there isn't anything glaringly wrong. If you disproved climate change scientifically I would think you would likely win the Nobel prize. It would be a very significant discovery and help us learn more about our planet and the entire universe. 
He only wanted to drain it so he could pump in his own sludge. 
Who cares what Hillary has to say?

Who do you trust, experts, or people drafting legislation in secret, then ignoring their constituents because they know the bill is insanely unpopular? I trust experts every time over those who have proven that they are out to cut taxes for the rich and erode the social safety net every chance they get.

You don't have to trust experts, you can read the bill. It is awful.
Experts. 
Visited the USSR himself and also on his honeymoon with his wife.  Follows Marx.  He doesn't care about the middle class when he's willing to tax the hell out of them for socialist healthcare.

Stupid sheep.  You're in the wrong subreddit fool.

now, will someone please close the coffin lid?
If now everyone, even Republicans, are openly talking about Russian interference that changes the outcome of the elections... would this mean new elections?
No.  There is absolutely no proof whatsoever that Russia changed the outcome of our election.
So then why does Rush and others like him act as if it is already a fact? I agree - The FBI, CIA and NSA all say in their reports that they make no estimation on the effects of Russia hacking...

But in the end everyone treats the hack of a Gmail account as if it was the only thing that happened during the election.

The right is just so stupid when it comes to this stuff it is astounding. Can't believe Rush is going to run down that path...
It would be nice if they let her bunk with hrc.
It won't happen. And I'm sick and tired of it. 


I want these people in JAIL. I love a Gowdy roast as much as the next guy, but that's the worst it ever gets and then they are let off no problem. It's ridiculous.
James O'Keefe? Spelling "quality" with a 'k' I take it.
Since CNN caught the errors themselves, doesn't that reflect well on them by demonstrating a willingness to acknowledge the fact they are human instead of standing by a report which didn't meet established standards?
Hannity, peddler of the Seth Rich conspiracy, is calling out another network for fake news?  Pot meet kettle.
It's always a good sign when clear breaches of standards result in job losses.  Good on CNN.  Now if only Fox would fire Hannity for the Seth Rich nonsense maybe they'd be trustworthy again.
Alternatively you could say that CNN really has lost **a lot** of credibility if they operate on the same level as Hannity. 
He wasn't considering the thing that was said in the title. He was talking about people that thought that before the election. How could he think that Obama didn't do anything about the Russians if he doesn't think the Russians did anything
[removed]

[removed]
Yassssss! Now let's get to the bottom of the Seth rich story FINALLY
[removed]
I don't think they're near his level.  People lost their jobs over this story. Hannity is still employed, and only begrudgingly backed off while maintaining he'd still keep looking.

You are right though, they have lost credibility. Any outlet would in this situation. The resignations go a long way to help though. 

The NY Times has been fielding alot of fake news from the White House, and so far has caught them all. I can't help but wonder if this was the White House playing CNN. 
Isn't it a good thing that CNN has publicly pulled a news piece that wasn't factually correct, and censured (or fired) those responsible for it? Isn't that better than standing behind it, or quietly just removing it without any repercussions to the people involved? I took this as a good sign, not that they got caught ok this one piece, and it proves everything else is also fake. 
Except that CNN has done what real news organizations do when they discover a story was in error. They issued a retraction, did an internal investigation, and let several people go (and three senior people at that).

OTOH, Sean Hannity has never retracted the Seth Rich conspiracy; he just backed down a little. Fox News retracted their reporting on it, but have allowed Hannity to keep promoting it.

But what's really going on here is that there is so much negative press being generated by the Trump administration that Hannity is trying to give Trump's core voters watching Fox News other things to fixate on and be mad about. One of his angles of attack is to put the news media on a circus trial.
Hannity pushed the Seth Rich thing for a couple of weeks, how long have we been hearing about Russia?   Yea, three people got fired, but according to the video Sean highlighted in this monolog, the problem goes a lot deeper than those three people.  
&gt; Since CNN caught the errors themselves, 

They didn't.
Question the motive in the first place to run with that unfounded story...
Black Lives MAGA is one of the funnier tag lines I've seen in a long long time.... a long time.
discussing this FAKE theme only feeds the left.  covering = all wrong
&gt; Hannity pushed the Seth Rich thing for a couple of weeks, how long have we been hearing about Russia?

The reason you keep hearing about Russia is that there is regularly breaking news about it. That's as it should be.

Hannity was making shit up about Seth Rich.
&gt;  regularly breaking news about it

I have yet to see or hear of any evidence of anything actually going down, could you please point me to something worthy of this being a story for the past year?
Daddy loves us and only acts out of a selfless boundless love for us, his children. 

Even if he did have Russian help, which he didn't, but even if he did, collision IS NOT A CRIME. 
FAKE NEWS 
Just yesterday, Paul Manafort retroactively declared that he received $17 million from the Ukranian government, and at the same time he was under Trump's employ.
I haven't been watching the news recently.  If he took the money from the Ukranian government and it was intended as a bribe, wouldn't that be to go against Russia?  The way I understand the situation, Russia stole a bunch of land from Ukraine, and the two are different countries.  
Sure. But Who had the motive? If it's a grand conspiracy by CNN then these people that got fired should be adamant to get their story out, as the motive would've been CNN's and not theirs. If the motive was theirs because they wanted to take part in the torpedoing of Trump, then the outcome was appropriate and the price paid. 
Not exactly.

[Here, read for yourself.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-trump-campaign-chairman-paul-manafort-files-as-foreign-agent-for-ukraine-work/2017/06/27/8322b6ac-5b7b-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html)
Missing some context there.  I'd be interested to see if he expounded on that.
Huh?
No
Yeah probably not, unless he gets caught killing someone while raping someone, committing tax fraud, listening to nickelback, and singing the praises of hitler all at the same time before absentee ballots are sent out. 
no, libtards dems have no theme (except obstructionism and Trump hate)

btw, would you take your kids to a wacko left wing doctor?  not me
focus on Trump...focus on Obama.  who ta fuck cares?

it's all trash as Obama/Hillary et al will skate no matter what.  **nothing** will happen legally to arrest/convict these criminals...**nothing**
I loved Sean, but Sarah has a grace that can't be beat. Great answer!
None of those rebuttals are true.  The Clinton campaign didn't spread birther stuff.  

There is absolutely no evidence of widespread voter fraud.  IIRC there have been more verified and prosecuted examples of pro-Trump fraud than pro-Hillary. 

Trump cared enough about crowd size to lie about it and make a big deal about it.  It wouldn't have been more than a passing observation otherwise.  

A proven serial liar wasn't trying to keep a man famed for his integrity honest.  No one believes that.

If you just listen to the leftist anti-fa type of course they are freaking out. Centrist really could care less
The Left has clearly decided against this, which was pretty much the entire point of the commercial.

lol, I assumed this video was satire trying to paint the NRA as being willing to shoot their fellow Americans over political disagreements.

I see very little agitating for violence on either the right or the left. No serious folks think shooting someone is a viable response to losing an election.

Yeah, liberals think the GOP are wrong, but Republicans think Democrats are wrong too. We all make fun of each other and call the other side snowflakes, or racists, or un-American. 

I think owning a gun, knowing how to use it safely, and never talking about it is a pretty American course of action. Speak softly, carry a big stick, and don't get upset if someone calls you a bad word. Let's be mature.

This video is hysterical.
so our plan for people sneaking into this country is to spend 2 million a person to feed and house them for 10 years? sounds great......
No where in that commercial at any point do they mention using a gun.  If maturity is what you want then why are you misrepresenting what that commercial is about?
???  they're being deported as fast as possible and new illegal entries are less than half of Obama's numbers.  criminals, yea, fuck 'em, rot in jail.  in 2-3 years, things will be settled down
it said 10 to 20 years, at over 140k a year to "rot in jail" thats 1.4 million minimum. I really don't feel like spending that kind of money to house and feed them.
agreed, it's a lot of money, but the law must be enforced, American security is critical
creating a new law to enforce a political agenda, and then defending it by saying the law needs to be enforced is not an argument.  lets spend billions on keepimg our prisons full of pot smokers ( the #1 federal crime violated by illegals).  this really sounds like a hand out to provate prisons to me and nothing else.
What *is* the commercial about? "Liberals be crazy. I'm going to defend us." Coming from a gun advocacy group, it's not hard to infer that the NRA here is saying, "Keep your guns handy in case you've got to stop some liberal nuts."

If that wasn't what they were going for, they should have shown the video to some non-NRA folks to see how it was received, and maybe tweaked the language.
Fight their lies with the truth, its a very simple message.  You can't possibly be this dense.
"They use their media *to assassinate* real news." Okay, kind of charged language there.

"They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler." I wasn't aware that schools are 'liberal' or 'conservative,' and I haven't seen any stories of schools comparing President Trump to Hitler. This just seems made up.

"They use {entertainment folks} to repeat their narrative over and over again." This is legit.

"And then they use their ex-president to endorse 'the resistance.'" Rhetoric on the left of 'resist' might have some legitimate grounding in a desire to push back against Republican policies, but yeah, some people act like they're fighting a war and that Republicans are the enemy. Again, I haven't seen *Obama* personally speak out in those sorts of terms. I think the NRA's line here is grounded in some truth, but is playing into the narrative of us being at war with people we disagree with politically.

... "The only way is to fight this violence of lies," again, that's charged language, casting things far more militantly than I think is necessary, "with the clenched fist of truth," and that's where it gets hilarious to me, because that turn of phrase is as silly as '#RESIST.'

Dude, in a country of 300 million people there've been maybe a dozen minor riots in the past seven months that broke some windows. There have been some marches. Yeah, the left media is crying bloody murder, but that's what the right media did about Obama for 8 years. They want people's eyes glued to TV, or to get people clicking on links. They make money by being sensational.

People need to calm the fuck down. The actual gulf between the two sides is not nearly as big as media figures are making it seem like. Yeah, there are some lies on both sides, but mostly it's differences of opinion. To say we need a 'clenched fist' to deal with liberal 'violence' is a big overreaction.

We need successful governance and positive messaging about how our policies have actually made people's lives better. We need our politicians to have town hall meetings with people who disagree with them, listen to their opinions, and say what they want to do to help.

We don't need snarling YouTube videos saying liberals are the enemy. Because guess what? When you act like someone is your enemy, they might just listen to you, and pick a fight. 

The NRA is a lucky fucking organization. They do spin real well. During Obama's presidency, they got gun and ammo sales to go up by like 150%. Gun sales are down now that Trump is in office. This sort of rhetoric is just an attempt to get people anxious so they buy more guns and ammo.
I'm not reading all that.  Take it easy.
Yes! 
Lol missing context. Go watch the other video exposing another CNN producer. It's been bullshit from day one. Even my friends in the Democratic Party know this. 
I'm curious what ya'll think about this
Everyone here in Missouri knows that the newly elected AG, Josh Hawley, is going to run for that seat and will probably end up winning.

way more dramatic than Trump sex stuff.  sounds like a shoe in
if it were me, no way I would answer the same f*cking question a 100 times.  Trump is being too kind to the enemy
Ouch.  ". . . to the enemy" is not going to help anyone.
help?  like the "media" helps America?  like they help Trump get things done?
Ah.  The media.  You see, the media wants to sell air time, and sensation and extremism sells.  Calling people "the enemy" helps the media, but doesn't help America.  It is playing right into the media's hands.
CNN will be for sale shortly as part of the AT&amp;T deal.  maybe something good will happen
We can hope.
heard a rumor on the radio today that Limbaugh may be the buyer
It's not just about air time for outlets like CNN, MSNBC, NYT,  and the like.  They are leftist first and honest journalism means nothing to them.

You see it in our schools, you see it in the nightly news and stories they publish, and you see it when someone hacks them and their dirty laundry gets aired.  

Acting like this isn't a reality is helping them, calling them what they are is exposing them.  They are an enemy to the American people, they should all be exposed for the liars that they are.

I only hope more hacks take place and more undercover videos expose them further.  
I wish it was just leftists.  It's been every media outlet.  There's no zone where they aren't gunning for their bottom line of solid truth and building a better society for everyone.
No it hasn't.  What the left considers "far right wing" was what both political parties felt was best for this country just a couple decades ago.

Now center right is considered far right by the journalist and their ignorant viewers and readers.  Things like free-market capitalism, balanced budgets, self reliance, and being proud of your country were all normal.  Now the left and the Democratic Party believe these beliefs make you an extremist.

I don't know how old you are but this country and its politics were much more centrist before Bush and Obama.  Now the wheels have fallen off.
 Obama the thinker --trump the imbicile 
&gt; Post or comment only if you support the GOP and its candidate Donald Trump.

/r/politics is your true home
Petersen is running as a republican to challenge Claire McCaskill. We need more senators like Rand Paul in congress and AP would be that constitutional voice it's severely lacking. 
From across the aisle, that was well spoken. You and I probably disagree on a lot of things which is fine but it's comforting to know not everyone buys into the bullshit. It's worrisome that so many (on both sides) are happy to get angry and toss reason out the window 

As long as I'm at it I gotta say I'm a gun enthusiast but do not care for the NRA at all. 
Much appreciated.
Republicans are such disgusting, selfish shitbags. 
Dope opinion
A politician and party who equate health insurance with having a gun pointed at somebody's head isn't bringing anything constructive to the table. 
Again, nice opinion
I really feel like Rand Paul is more libertarian and less Republican. I wish we could get away from Republican/Democrat and more than two parties. I also feel like Libertarian is closer in values to the a true conservative Republican than what the current Shite Republican Party represents.
Yea don't understand this move. At least throw in a undersecretary of state or some other official.

The Clinton body count goes up!
How many dead can be attributed to the Clintons now?
You guys might be missing the point. While the word Clinton is in the headline, the place where this guy was looking for the emails was somewhere between the Russians and Michael Flynn. And although everyone says that it was a suicide, with no signs of foul play, the people who would have been most interested in stopping this guy wasn't first and foremost the Clintons. 
Why did Obama Administration not do proper vetting on the lawyer before allowing her a visa to enter the USA ? Double Standards by Democrats who are incensed by the lawyer being in contact with Don Trump Jr. Can the Democrats be entrusted with the security of the nation in the future?

John McCain, the "honorable American", who seeks at every turn to fuel the movement towards bringing down the Trump  administration. God does he have skeletons hanging in every closet he has at home/office.
Before I answer, WHICH Clinton are you referring to? That is very important.
He's a traitor 
either that's a re-post or what?  I know I heard Limbaugh cover the truth a long time back.  McCain is scum
What's currently happening? The New Red Scare you mean?
Ex foreign government spy.  Obviously McCain is colluding with foreign governments to meddle in US elections.
Got dirt, turned it over to the FBI. Somehow a bit less traitorous than working with a foreign government that wanted to get him elected.


What vetting would have kept her away from a hearing dealing with her client? What about her should have kept her out?


You mean try the people behind it?

She had a case in U.S. court.

Shame. Would have loved to be able to work with Russia on matters like this. Democratic voter fraud is the single greatest threat to our nation and this would have helped address it. 
how so? what makes her more qualified than any single other individual there?
Expel McCain. Stop electing the war-mongering zombie
Not sure if you are referencing McCain or Trump but it has yet to be proved if trump personally had any contact at all with any Russians. I believe firmly that he did not and that will be the end result of the investigation. It may turn out that members of his campaign colluded with Russians and they will have to pay the penalty. That will be their problem. Meanwhile Trump will continue to deliver EXACTLY what he promised the electorate last year in his campaign. So far he has kept many of his promises. Only the underhand doings of traitorous Congress , the Liberal MSM and those Americans who are jealous of him and who hate him and will stop at nothing to bring him down. Trump will overcome. VIVA TRUMP !
&gt;Not sure if you are referencing McCain or Trump 

Has to be McCain. The Trump people never approach the FBI. When they thought that a foreign government was working against the United States they welcomed the effort. McCain went to the FBI. 

&gt;but it has yet to be proved if trump personally had any contact at all with any Russians. 

It is clear that the Trump campaign eagerly welcomed working with the Russian government to undermine our elections. You can't deny that. So you are holding on to a very think piece of ice, that somehow since they didn't get the information (at that meeting) they are not guilty. 

Now we do have the claims from another person in the meeting. A former Russian intelligence agent. He says that the lawyer left a folder for Jr. So now you have to say that after all the long list of lies Jr. is telling the truth and that folder didn't have anything.

&gt;Meanwhile Trump will continue to deliver EXACTLY what he promised the electorate last year in his campaign.

Trump promised to replace the ACA with something that cost less, covered more conditions, and covered more people. Is he working to deliver that? Trump promised he was going to punish China for being a currency manipulator, did he do that? 

&gt;Only the underhand doings of traitorous Congress ,

So McConnell and Ryan are *traitors*? Can you please explain to me how the Republicans in Congress are traitors while Jr. and Manifort and Kushner are not? Please use one standard of evidence  and proof. You have no proof that Trump was, where is your proof that Congress is?


He wrecked one part (a very good part to wreck, racism of police), but downplayed everything else.  That, unfortunately, is NOT the way a dialogue trying to improve things should go.  That's the "I want to win" dialogue technique, not the "I want to make the world better" dialogue we need.

So I am both happy and unhappy with this conversation.
wait, is it true that 2/3 of the people cops kill are unarmed and non violent? holy crap!!!! am i the only one that was blown away by that? isnt that murder? thats the stat that rocked my world during that interview 
&gt;am i the only one

 Probably not

The tone of your post indicates that you did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016 election.
John McCain is a proven American traitor.
During the Vietnam War he was charged with Treason. As a prisoner of war he colluded with the Viet Cong. The info he gave led to a 60% increase in the number of GIs who were captured . In addition he made the infamous "Tokyo Rose" propaganda recording for the Viet Cong in which he gave support and comfort to the enemy, amongst other things. He was later pardoned by Richard Nixon who must have known what was in store for himself later and was building up "Brownie Points" in his favour. Any actions re Russia by the Trump Campaign, pale into insignificance compared to McCain's acts of Treason.

I do not support colluding with Russians by any member of the Trump campaign. I am merely underlining that it is with certainty that this did not include President Trump. Any member of the Campaign who did collude, should be punished.

Trump has delivered on many of his campaign promises. He has cut 
 business regulations massively; he has tightened border security through his Travel Ban on 6 Muslim majority countries which, I will remind you, has the support of the SUPREME COURT. He has helped to increase the number of jobs since being sworn in by close to a million with millions more in the pipeline through trade deals made with China, Saudi Arabia et al. 
He would have delivered  more affordable health care were it not for the continuous bickering among Republican Moderates and Republican Conservatives in Congress. The GOP has been disastrously divided since the arrival of the Tea Party in 2010. Instead of uniting to support the President's Health Care ideas which will benefit all Americans, the Republicans squabble like schoolkids. 

Where in my post did I accuse McConnell and Ryan of being traitors? I admire Mitch Mcconnell. He has an unenviable job dealing with his gangsters in the Senate. I DO think that some Republicans in the Senate and House ARE TRAITOROUS to Trump because they ARE COLLUDING with lousy Democrats to undermine the President. After all, several of them were members of Romney's Never Trumpers during the campaign and , it seems. still are! 

If Don Trump Jr, Manafort, Kushner and anyone else from the Campaign/White House are found guilty of collusion, they must pay the price. President Trump will not be one of them.
Then the question of LEAKS. Who the hell keeps on leaking info to the NY Times, CNN, NBC, ABC and the Left Wing media? Those people should be punished harshly
Finally......... the question of your posts. This "SUB" has strict rules among them being one that posts disrespectful towards the President will be removed. You have been disrespectful to the President and I hope the Moderators remove them. 


She has no knowledge or understanding, no relevant education or experience whatsoever, but she is a Trump and obviously far better qualified than those that has! :-D
"Muslim" women, aka paid strippers.
&gt;John McCain is a proven American traitor. During the Vietnam War he was charged with Treason.

Charged by whom? Convicted by whom?

&gt;I do not support colluding with Russians by any member of the Trump campaign. I am merely underlining that it is with certainty that this did not include President Trump.

What makes you so certain of that?

&gt;He has helped to increase the number of jobs since being sworn in by close to a million

Unemployment is down by about a tenth of a % IIANM. 

&gt;with millions more in the pipeline through trade deals made with China, Saudi Arabia et al. 

What deals? And certainly not the Carrier jobs. That cost a couple of million $ and the jobs are going away anyway.

&gt;Instead of uniting to support the President's Health Care ideas 

I know what Trump said he wants, lower costs, lower deductibles, more coverage, more people covered. I know that what he said he wants is not in the bills proposed. Do you know what ideas Trump has to achieve those goals? 

&gt;Where in my post did I accuse McConnell and Ryan of being traitors? 

"underhand doings of traitorous Congress"

Who did that refer to?

&gt;I DO think that some Republicans in the Senate and House ARE TRAITOROUS to Trump

Traitorous to Trump? Trump is not the country, Trump is not our king. Disagreeing with the president is not traitorous.

I liked Watters world.

As a news anchor Jesse Watters freaking sucks. Hard. 

Fox News has become absolute horseshit anyways. 

Trump is anything but certainly not a conservative...

I have no idea where I was going with this comment...

Fuck Fox News. Goddamn government propaganda outlet. "Independent" my ass. 
still?

are you kidding?  it'll never stop
To be fair when you go away from the mainstream news organizations half the time it is nonsense you find. The left has people that are guilty of it too. Here is an example of that https://patribotics.blog Now you will sometimes find real news on those sites and but there is so much fake news on the sites facebook doesn't want to link to them even if they were one of the first to report it because they don't want the fake news to overshadow the real news. So if they decide to post something true on this liberal fake news site for once facebook won't link to it either because it is a horrible source for its other information, and the more fake news that is put next to real news, the harder it becomes to tell the difference between the two. 
This article is very out of date 
Even if a non-fake news story is posted, there will still be links to fake stories all over the website
My issue with conservative news lately is that most of it seems to be fake lately, and the few that are based on fact are heavily editorialized to omit important context on the facts.  We'd be better off without them in our feeds.  If a "news" source seems to always print stories that reinforce your views, it's probably not real news. (I'm looking at you, Breitbart.)
That was my point with far right and far left sites yes

The same premium cost problem exists if healthy people opt out, though. That's how insurance works. It is, by it's very nature, a socialist concept. The healthy subsidize the sick. I don't understand enough about the topic to know how this plan is any different from the ACA in that respect.
I remember something about Obama instructing people to preserve evidence that Trump might try to suppress or destroy. I also remember something about wiretapping Trump Tower. It sounds like he was trying something. 
of course.  exchange one dolt (Obama) for a another
Wow.  This is sentationalism captured in a single headline.
If you want to discredit a group, "tie" them to something very negative.  And you can "tie" them by any loose association you can find.  I wouldn't do this to anyone, because I wouldn't want anyone doing this to me.  

Where is the morality in this article and headline?  Do we just toss morality for profit?

Getting rid of Net Neutrality is bad for everyone except ISPs.  He who controls the information controls the world?  So what is the end game here?  Do we WANT them regulating what we can access based on the ISP's goals?
So uhh do you mind if I ask who you voted for president in 2008? 
To answer your question... after 9/11 was the last time I can remember that we came together as a nation. Congress voted on many different bi-partisan acts to our strengthen national security and to go after the people/groups responsible. 

HRC was a member of congress then and voted note only for the war in a Afghanistan but also the war in Iraq something that has been thrown in her face in both presidential elections she was apart of. 

I am sure everyone can agree It would be nice to get back to having both parties working together to strengthen our country. 
I didn't. I supported Sarah Palin but she was not top of the ticket.

Nothing on God's earth would have persuaded me to vote for either McCain or bloody Obama.
This video thinks Donald won a beauty pageant or something. He has been entrusted with a responsibility that he is failing. 
LMAO! Oh.. sure.. Putin wanted Hillary to win... *Okay, whatever you say, bud!*
In what area is he failing?
Why shouldn't ISPs have goals and long-term plans and be free to negotiate whatever contracts they want?

Do you think they are slaves? How long do you think they will continue to attempt to deliver the best quality product at the lowest price if we treat them like slaves?
Being president 
I understand that ISPs, like any business, will try to maximize their profits and minimize their costs.

But if you think they are 

A) slaves (hyperbole much?)

B) delivering the best quality (or anywhere close) product

C) lowest prices

you haven't been paying attention to how they handle location where they have regional monopolies.  Look at how poorly they treat customers that have no other options, and you will see what their real goals are.

You know a lot about a person by how they treat those who can't defend themselves.

If you know how to deliver a better product for a lower price, go start an ISP right now because you will make literally billions of dollars. Everyone I know is absolutely willing to pay less for better internet!

Once you regulate the ISPs, you turn them into slaves, more or less. You eliminate innovation, competition. We did it to the health care industry in the 30s, and you see what happened?
Too many to list.  I'm just saying that it's nonsensical for Trump-supporters to call the Democrats "sore losers" as if he won a football match.  They talk as if the Democrats are trying to have Trump's medal revoked because he took steroids or something.  The Democrats have every right to oppose his plans and even the Republicans owe him no loyalty, that's not how the federal government is designed to work.
He's doing a fantastic job so far in my opinion.  Trump is doing exactly what I wanted him to do.  I couldn't be happier with President Trump.

He may be failing at what you want, but as far as those who supported him and made him president; he's doing great.

That's how our government works, just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's a failure.  We won, you lost.  Suck it up and tell your party and/or representatives to quit acting like lunatics and maybe you'll win some seats back.  But the train is off the tracks on the left and the leftist ideology has been rebuked by the American people.
I'm so shocked that you and /u/baronbifford can't be specific (I'm not) 
This is filthy. Nice. 
It's almost as though once people step out of their bubbles and get confronted on their beliefs that are constantly reaffirmed and never challenged within their bubbles, they have an epiphany and realize how batshit insane their thinking has been.  Watching this video you can almost see it happen with this Huffington Post guy.

I truly hope he goes back to work and realizes how truly idiotic his coworkers are and gets the hell out of that deplorable shitrag pretending to be a news organization.

This may have been a live recording of a red pilling, how magnificent.
What is he doing that you wanted him to do? 
Did you vote for trump for policy reasons or because of a general feeling?

if you want to hear what happened on repeal-replace, listen to Rush from Tuesday on pod cast.  Limbaugh cuts right through and destroys the notion that anybody (almost all) in Washington is actually acting in the interests of the American people

not for just this situation, but for all politics 
Great response !
there is an immigration **debate** because non liberals engage

that act gives credence to the whack job left and they run with it

the libtards never ever give a crap about what's constitutional, what's legal, what The People want, what makes sense.  those are not limitations for the progressives

destroying libtards in debates = no such thing.  they don't care and move on
You have no idea how markets work. At all.

70% of people in this country only have 1 or 2 choices for ISP.

Take a minute, genius, and wonder why?

Maybe because the barrier to entry is so high? Hint, not because of that scurryyyy gubmint regulation, either.
Michael Caputo was NOT a Clinton adviser. He was a TRUMP adviser. He's Republican. He would never work for a Democrat. He also worked as adviser for Boris Yeltsin. 
You know Republicans and conservatives are having a bad time when they're trying to divert attention away from their troubled president to a candidate that lost the election.
He's doing a great job. The best job really. Probably the best president in the history of presidents. Great.
You don't seem bothered that FranklinAbernathy can't be specific about Trump "doing a fantastic job" though. 

Trump hasn't fulfilled any campaign promises except for maybe trying to ban Muslims from coming into the country. What else has he done? 
Do you also think that fire service and the army should be privatized and unregulated?  If you're a Libertarian you'll say yes, but there are some things that just don't work in a free market. Back when fire departments were private companies, people's homes burned down for being late on the bills. They could demand payment before putting a fire out. They could collect money and NOT do their jobs. Who was there to watch over them? 

ISPs essentially have monopolies/duopolies in most markets. That's the problem with trying to let them do whatever they want. They have TOO much control because of the way they restrict competition in that market. 

Libertarians are being way short-sighted in this matter. They say that we shouldn't regulate them, but you don't realize that these same ISPs are lobbying to regulate the utility lines in the first place making competition impossible. 
Without specifics I can only assume you're easy to impress. 
Did you know Trump has the best golf/work ratio out of all presidents so far? Proof that he's doing a great job.
Golf frequency isn't proof of an effective presidency. 

A simple google search also proves your statement wrong. 

Any other specifics?
i'm just being sarcastic. I think Trump is doing a terrible job.
Upvote 
Since the HHS works for an administration that has very bad habit of misrepresenting things, I'll wait for the CBO score before passing judgement.  I should note, every sector of the healthcare industry has come out against this.  I've yet to see one expert support it.
He needs to resign immediately.  
OMG! A foreign government didn't call the family of a citizen of a different country? That's ... actually ... not at all meaningful.

How bad is your google-fu with respect to news searches if you have to post claims about the Canadian government doing something in a subreddit about *America*? While I know Donnie's antics are doing the party no favours, posts like this reek of desperation.
Is there a guarantee my current policy will still be available, though? I like the one I have under the ACA.
This is silly. The Cruz amendment lowers premiums but allowing policies full of holes. Boosts enrollment because they are less expensive so easier to afford and people won't realize they aren't fully covered until it is too late. A leaky boat is less expensive but that doesn't make it a wise purchase.
curable....darn
Good. I hope we arrest this traitor. Membuh when he betrayed his men in Vietnam? I membuh. Membuh when he met with the ISIS leader Al-Baghdadi? I membuh. I can't empathize with this evil meat bag. 
anybody here listen to Hannity?

Hannity frequently has a doctor on air who offers a plan for basically concierge doctor service plus a crazy good drug plan.  for $50 per customer and I think $25 for the others in your family, almost everything is covered **AND** treated.  hospital stuff is something else, but if the doctor can do it in his clinic, it's handled

so Hannity wants to know, how can this doctor (and his pal doctors) do it and still make a doctor's wage...WTF can't fucking Congress do it?
what VOTE?  there wasn't even a debate.  what amendments?  it's all fucked up
John McCain, hope is better, he is an awesome public servant.
Agreed, what a life he’s led.

I'm not a libertarian. I'm a conservative. They value freedom, I value rights.

RE private fire or armies: If you want to hire someone to protect your house from fire or thieves, you should be free to do so.

When it comes to protecting the community, then you have the problem of externalizing costs. IE, if I am surrounded by people who pay the fire company, and I don't, then I am getting "free" fire protection from fires that start down the street. I am shifting the costs of living in that area to my neighbors, and that isn't fair.

In the case of fire, I can go either way. I would argue that we should have mandatory fire insurance / fire service, and you choose which company it goes to, to prevent fraud and abuse, just like car insurance. This would prevent externalizing costs without giving government funds to dip their hands into.

In the case of military protection, the only reasonably mechanism is to charge everyone protection money and then protect everyone equally. Thus, the government.

Police protection: I don't want it. If I want to protect myself, I'll carry a gun and learn basic self-defense. If I want to protect my neighborhood, I'll organize a neighborhood watch and if need be, organize the militia locally to take out the gangs. I believe justice should be enforced by those who are harmed by the illegal actions, or not at all. The courts might need marshalls, but that's about it for local protection. You'll note that when America started, nobody had police. That was an idea imported from Europe, and police there doubled as a means of controlling the masses.
You have no idea how market work. You have this marxist view of the world, that workers and owners are two separate and distinct people, and ne'er the twain shall meet.

I submit to you:

* Starting an ISP, without any government regulation, is easy. Thousands upon thousands have done it, and, barring regulation, thousands maybe millions more will.
* Starting an ISP that makes money is a different story. However, if you can show a rich man that you can make money if only you had some money, then you can get as much money as you need to make money. *This is what investments and loans are for, and you can't argue that they don't work because they enable people to access billions of dollars, if need be, to start multi-billion dollar companies.*

The reason why only 1 or 2 choices exist is because the market will bear no more. Why? Because you can't make money providing better ISP services to people there at a lower price.

Among the many costs of doing business is the very real cost of regulations. Regulations raise the costs of providing ISP services, so that you get fewer competitors and higher prices and lower quality.

Also, I'm reporting you for insulting my intelligence and education. You can make your point and remain civil at the same time. The fact that you need to resort to insults is a reflection on your intellectual capability, not mine.
That's sick.
[Nah.](https://tenor.com/view/naw-mikeepps-nah-hell-hellnaw-gif-5613336)
&gt; people love Trump to making America great again

How is the weather in Russia? 
Trump offers an opportunity to the GOP. Republicans can portray him as a proponent of every unpopular position the party has adopted over the years. And just in time for the midterms, the GOP can flush him and and that hot mess of crap that appeals only to 85-year-old, almost-dead voters who will never vote Democrat anyway. 

Trump will hang on through the midterms, and resign in disgrace the end of January, with just over two years in office, taking unpopular party planks with him. 

Pence serves out the remainder of Trump's term, and remains eligible for two terms himself. He gets to run as the incumbent in 2020 *and* 2024, head of a GOP that has dumped its garbage. 

Trump's inevitable ouster signals the start of a post-post-truth era of American politics. 


Doesn't the party then have to abandon all those positions? 
Unpopular positions like "repeal the ACA" or "abandon the Paris accords", or a bunch of the stuff the Tea Party brought in. Stuff that makes small gains in certain places, but ultimately costs far more votes nationally. Stuff the GOP would be glad to rid itself of if it had the opportunity to do so.

They don't "have" to abandon them. They *want* to get rid of them. They just need an excuse to do so. The overwhelming majority of moderate Republicans want to be able to point to their radical-right primary opponent and say "We impeached the last guy who thought that way" without being called a RINO or a liberal shill. 


I liked Spicer but he was too weak, e.g.

he would answer the same (Russian) question 10x every meeting.  WTF?
That sounds like a very PR friendly and candy coated answer.  Not really that informative at all.  Reading between the lines, there does seem to still be a sound relationship between Spicer and the President that is untainted as both men have expressed that sentiment strongly since the resignation was announced.  He also is staying on to help with the transition which is a big clue that there is not bad blood here.

If I had to guess, I'd say that Spicer was likley vying for that communications director position and, when he didn't get it, he had opportunities elsewhere that would have been better for his career (financially) than remaining press secretary at the WH.  That's my guess.
Class act
I'd ditch the idea that improvement isn't worth it unless it's perfect. These guys who vote against improvement are basically voting for the status quo. We should be after continuous improvement, not perfection. 
I would sacrifice every Democrat (guillotine) to get the Trump/Peoples' agenda implemented
That doesn't really sound like a democracy.    

How about try a lighter approach... like sacrifice taxes cuts for boarder wall funding and welfare program deductions.
It easier to vote for something when you know it will never actually happen. When they voted for this repeal it was guaranteed to be vetoed so there was only the consequence of not voting for it. . 
hey bro, we're paying the highest corporate taxes in the world

your choice/idea sucks
No bipartisanship is ultimately they way forward. You thinking only your ideas are the correct ones without any room for negotiating or compromise is part of the problem. 

I think guillotining people who have an ideological difference would be a bigger issue then corporate taxes would be if it were to start happening. 
That's how you interpret that interview?"Destroys"? Caps lock, even?

Strange days we're living in. 
Comment EVISCERATES the headline
OP: what gives? you have weirdly taken Fox news video content and rebranded it with your own mark called "Surplus News". Why do that? You've covered the Fox logo and replaced it, pretending it is  your own.

Each day for the last three weeks you've taken a Fox clip, rebranded it and posted the video to this sub and two others (r/democrat and /r/conspiracy).

I'm no attorney, but this sure looks like blatant copyright infringement and an attempt to benefit off the work of others by representing it as your own. If so, that is NOT COOL.

FYI - I've sent a note to Fox's legal department (ldepartment@foxnews.com) with all the info about your YouTube channel and Reddit posting. I expect you may be hearing from one of their lawyers soon. 

Good luck with that.
Can't scooch the mooch
Words don't mean anything anymore.  Print, audio, video, whatever; it doesn't mean anything. You just have to call it locker room talk or say you were intentionally being imprecise because that's how your voters talk.  

Also, it's the internet so hyperbole is a caricature of itself. 
There's a disease in both parties where they act like it's all or nothing on all their agendas despite the fact we live in a pluralistic democracy. It's seriously getting tiresome with the purity tests.  I've voted R my whole life, except for Trump. But i'd like my party to start trying to govern the country as it is instead of how they wish it to be.
Republicans like McCain are the reason I haven't given up on my party yet. Hope he comes back soon. 
Their refusal to do a full repeal now shows that they understand what will happen if they do.  They know Obamacare was at least doing some good for their constituents that would go away with a repeal.  It also shows that they were ok with dishonest theatrics to get votes.  It's what has disappointed me with the party of late.  It's how we got a lifelong Democrat and an Obama-birther to represent us in 2016. 
If you "sacrificed" all democrats then who would you blame? 
Are we not allowed to be critical of trump?  Seems rather unamerican.  Also seems rather foolish. 
I hear you, but it seems the caricature nature of the internet is increasingly directing people's thinking in real life.

Odd how far people are willing to compromise themselves for Donald Trump, of all people. 

This man: http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/donald-trump-mark-bowden-playboy-profile
&gt; Post or comment only if you support the GOP and its candidate Donald Trump.

this is the rule from the sidebar.  if you check that user's post history you will see that he is not a GOP supporter.  and frankly the jury's still out on you.  i haven't decided if you're a legit supporter of the GOP, or a conservative, or just a concern troll.
The us corporate tax is between 15-35 % It's not the highest in the world, It's on par with the rest of the western world.
Nothing. Republicans have nothing to say about this. Which means they support it.
Just want to point out that the way the questions in the survey are worded shows a heavy bias for democrats
I'm sorry, but I'm a little confused on what it is you are actually wanting.  All this shows is there is a clear difference of opinion on how to run the federal government with a near clear split on party line.  As a matter of fact, it goes more to show how screwed the public is , because the parties are unwilling to meet in the middle any.
Wait a sec. The comment isn't showing survey results. It's showing actually vote tallies in the House and Senate. 
Yep. And not a single comment in the thread.
I'm still a little confused on what it is you and op are actually wanting here.  All it's showing is a split in opinion with the parties.  How to run the federal government is not black and white.  This drill down seems to have been made with the idea that the GOP only votes for things that are bad.  Just because it's not the way the democrats voted doesn't make it wrong.  Do I agree 100% with them? No, but I do with some of these issues.
What's the debate on election and campaign finance reform?
Republicans are completely useless, UNLESS you are very rich or are a corporation seeking to curb stomp employee's rights.

They do not give a flying fuck about the rest of us (although they pretend they do for votes). 

Just today the Senate GOP is voting to take away health insurance for the poor, the sick, and the elderly...

What a GREAT bunch of old rich white guys.
...and doesn't cover squat as far as health is concerned.
What's the debate on Federal Law limiting how a citizen supports their chosen candidate in a freely held election, where campaigns are run using donations?   
 I'm not saying i agree with them in their voting, but there are reasons they vote certain ways.  Just because you dont agree with the opposition doesnt mean there isnt an argument there.
i love how this post was made in the form of a question, but everything about it and the comments just screams "we desire no discussion, and we will use this as a way to shit on the ones i disagree with".
The idiot who wrote this thinks "make America great again" is unRepublican... but this was a Reagan slogan too (Let's make America Great Again)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again

EDIT: Now I get it, OP is author, offended at being called an idiot.  Well, do some research first.
The comments are full of cancer.
You're so misinformed, it's disgusting. The removal of Obamacare will help more people afford healthcare.
To be fair, I don't want them to meet in the middle. I want Democrats to go extinct.

There can be no ground given to socialism.
Welcome to Reddit.
Haha.. yeah, insurance that doesn't cover anything, has caps, and preexisting conditions that are uncovered. What good is *that* insurance then?

Cheap insurance isn't healthcare, it is you that is misinformed.
This isn't a survey, it's vote tallies in the House and Senate. 
Concerned citizens who are worried about government sponsored monopolies running amok? 
Democrats don't advocate socialism. If they did I'd actually support them. 

The ACA is neo-liberal, pro-corporate garbage and I want it replaced with a single payer.
If that's all you can afford, that's all you should have. I shouldn't be footing the bill for somebody else to have healthcare when I can't afford it for myself.
Even if the ACA isn't full socialism, it's too close to socialism to actually succeed. We should be getting further from it, not closer.
That many in the GOP do favor ensuring access to health care for everyone is true. Trump did run on it.

The problem is that:

* It has to lower cost, not increase it, like Obamacare is doing;
* There's no need to forbid a secondary system where people can pay for their care, therefore it won't be "single-payer", it will be socialized, but that doesn't mean single payer;

If Democrats weren't so out there, a solution to this problem could have been found a long time ago.
I love that "18% of GDP" figure these guys always trot out. However, they leave out that the largest part of that spending is by Medicare and Medicaid ([37%](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/highlights.pdf)), versus 33% for private insurance and 11% out of pocket. Medicare and Medicaid together cover [64 million](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/CMSProgramStatistics/2014/2014_Enrollment.html) Americans, just shy of 20%, where private insurance covers [208 million](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-hi/hi-01.2014.html), or 64%. So, the government's "ultra efficient" entitlement program spends more money to cover a third as many people. Seems legit. 

If we really wanted to drive that "18% of GDP" figure down, we'd simply switch all the Medicare/Medicaid enrollees to private plans. 


1. Do you have a citation from a disinterested source showing the fraction of GDP spent on healthcare has increased since the enactment of the ACA? If so, is the rate of increase during the subsequent seven years higher or lower than the rate seven years before its enactment?

2. Absolutely no proposal I have seen "forbids a secondary system". Please point to three proposals put forward by prominent Democrats which forbid a secondary system.

3. Seeing as how what became the ACA was the GOP proposal in the early days of the Clinton administration and seeing as how almost every major nation has enacted single-payer in some form or another, the idea the Democrats' proposals for single-payer or anything like it is "so out there" has zero basis in reality.
The proof is right here: I'm saying it's a reasonable position and yet you attack me.

Wouldn't you have to also compare the health of those on each and deductibles? 

I'm asking because I know a few people who waited until they were on Medicare and then had all kinds of stuff done that had been put off for years. 
Just speaking for myself, this is why I don't fall into line with the party on this issue and why I personally  support universal healthcare from a conservative viewpoint. 

One thing the GOP always does better than the other party is to consider the incentives. It is never a good idea to leapfrog those who choose not to work over those working hard. Yet when it comes to healthcare in the modern world, you can't really take the time to determine who is worthy and who should be allowed to die. Therefore, those at the bottom will get free care and those who are paying for the same thing will feel resentment. You are also dumping government money into a private system encouraging prices to rise to the point where those working and paying for themselves are sacrificing more than they should. 

If everyone had access to a low level of care it could be run and paid for much more efficiently. Let those who want and can afford extra purchase on a private market above and beyond what is available to all. It eliminates the accusations of unfairness to those who work and restores incentives to do as well as possible.

You have a healthier society and economy and that is one of the things the GOP is supposed to do better. 
has anyone noticed that **absolutely nothing** happens during/after these committee meetings?  I'm so fucking tired of the **pretend** game coming out of Congress.  they're all the swamp

and if you're a Dem, you have zero worries
"Simply switching" to private plans isn't so simple.  Medicare is specifically for old people, who use more healthcare.  They'd not be able to afford a private risk pool rate.
Costs went up under the ACA, but they went up at a slower rate than before it was implemented. "ACA caused out-of-control cost increases" was an effective political strategy but it was at best spin and at worst a cynical lie. 
Costs went up under the ACA, but they went up at a slower rate than before it was implemented. "ACA caused out-of-control cost increases" was an effective political strategy but it was at best spin and at worst a cynical lie. 
everybody hold your horses

first off, I don't buy this.  there is **absolutely nothing** government does better/cheaper...not in the history of the planet

just look at fraud alone.  government/taxpayers get fucked for billions and billions via government.  why?  because it's government and nobody actually gives a shit about other people's money

and these wonderful claims about Europe.  yea, they killed the latest person/baby just now...**refusing** to allow free help from outside.  why?  because they would/might get exposed as incompetent 

it goes on and on.  do you want your own doctor or the government doctor assigned to your case for $10 in his pocket?

I could type for hours on this topic/claim/bullshit
I see what you are saying although I don't know that I personally believe that waste and fraud are always higher than an average profit. I would like to know if you believe that the government can achieve things that private enterprise cannot? 

I have trouble envisioning a future in which a for-profit company puts a man on the moon, or builds a nationwide highway system, or gets electricity to every small town, or even a for-profit system in which every small child has the opportunity to learn to read. 
&gt; if you believe that the government can achieve things that private enterprise cannot? 

not really.  government is said to do so in tasks such as the Manhattan Project...but that actually was thousands of citizens who just happened to paid be with government checks

same with military equipment.  there is no government agency warehouse stuffed with people who do such work/engineering.  it's you and me and the guy down the street who do the work

government collects taxes **by force** then government pukes want parks and monuments named after them for spending **OUR MONEY**

for health, nobody actually wants insurance, but everybody wants health **care**.  all the media, every channel, every radio station, every newspaper calls it "the health care debate" but there is zero **care** with Obamacare and zero with all Republican attempts

government would have us suspend belief in the proven fact that free enterprise will deliver everything better/faster/cheaper which it has done for centuries.  like insurance across state lines.  like no mandates.  all we need is FREEDOM ...as in Free to Choose **without** fucking government interference/taxes/regulations

but citizen freedom means government pukes losing power...you see?
Lol and I thought libs were the snowflakes
Thanks for taking the time to explain that to me. I can see where you are coming from and I'm not going to try to change what you believe.

Those conclusions are harder to get to for me because I'm running a small business in a small town. This town got electricity when REMC was required to put it here in the 40's.  I have fast internet because the government required any provider to get it to any location in which there is a public school. The water company is a municipality and my bill have never gone over $50. 

Now I did move the business here from a larger city because the costs there were insane, mostly due to unneeded, in my opinion, government regulation. But that doesn't change the fact that I don't teach my employees to read and write and I don't pave my own roads or even plow them. I don't want government in my way, but I do think some practicalities and shared efforts are what make me competitive on a larger stage. So while I don't share all your conclusions, thanks for letting me know where you are coming from. 
As a Canadian, trust me: universal Healthcare is slow and ineffective. My mom waited 4 years for a hip replacement. My friend's mom and stepmother both died of cancer because of the ineffectiveness of our system. 

I have to book 2 weeks in advance to see my Dr. for a med renewal, if things are running smoothly. 

My dad currently needs a knee replacement. He's been off work for months now, waiting. 

It's nice not paying out of pocket, but our taxes account for over 50% of our income, and we're not even middle class. 

It's a mess here. 
This person is asking you to show sources to prove that what you're stating is true, not attacking you. That you didn't show your sources and instead accused them of attacking you makes your position seem pretty weak. Debating with you over your points is not an attack, and if you can't support your position then why do you have it?
I'm convinced this sub isn't Republican after this post. 

1. Government is the problem in healthcare; economists know it. Everyone friggin knows it.

2. Healthcare is not a right. This is not saying that people shouldn't have it; but it isn't. Private solutions are always better to public ones, ask Milton Friedman about that.

3. Look at what is going on in the rest of the world; health decisions are based on the best possible public outcome. Notice the word "Public". Look at the Charlie Gard case, where the government had overall decision on whether the plug will be pulled. Why? Because they were the ones footing the bill.

Friedman states very clear in "Freedom and Capitalism" that socialism(or even government social programs) limits freedom because individuals aren't footing their own bills. 

If Charlie had been an American with Private insurance, his family could've kept him alive as long as they had the money to do, and considering the amount they have raised(and the existence of hospitals like Shriner's and St. Jude, which are both free) he wouldve been kept alive.

4. This follows into my next point: Socialized medicine sucks. Even before Obamacare we had the best healthcare in the WORLD. Not the in our region, or even our hemisphere, but the World. Promising people free shit that we can't pay for may seem great and promising, but all it will do is hurt the people that policy is taking advantage of: the lower socio economic classes. When wait times become horrible, and people are dying waiting for surgeries, the top earners will be able to afford private solutions, everyone else will not. To end debaten this part of the issue: none of the congressmen and congresswomen that passed the bill are on the plans that the bill created.

When we passed Obamacare, those from foreign nations were coming to America for their healthcare because of intense wait times in their home nations. Now, instead of a  system with defects we could've survived on, we have turned our healthcare system into a ticking time bomb and now no one has the guts to stand up to the system.


Healthcare costs have been on the rise every year prior to Obamacare, costs have gone up under the ACA, but they've been doing that without it as well.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/U.S._Healthcare_Costs_Per_Capita.png/800px-U.S._Healthcare_Costs_Per_Capita.png

And no, demanding sources is not an attack on you.
Seems to me the problem is supply and demand.  You want to treat more people without having a plan to have more doctors and nurses and equipment and hospitals?  Good luck.  Find a way to increase supply and costs will go down, allowing us to add more demand.
Really, how badly could you debate against a repeal of citizens united? The Campaign Finance Disclosure act and DISCLOSE act were party line votes. 





You asked in a way that would make me look like an ass with my response, so I responded with the same question but posed in a way to make your stance look like a anti freedom of speech stance.  Again, I'm not saying I'm against these measures, but I'm at least acknowledging the existence of an opposing view....unlike a certain someone.
Okaaaay. The opposing pov is that money=speech, and thusly those who are wealthy get more say in things. I don't imagine there isn't an opposing view, I already know what it is.

If it is different from what I've posted, please enlighten me.
Conservatives would argue that you are focusing too much on the wealthy getting more of a say, and not enough on doing things differently would be the government enacting a limitation on freedoms.  Both sides have an argument IMHO.  
Fair enough. Though I'd say that's a pretty disingenuous argument coming from a group who wants to criminalize gay sex because of religious reasons.
Absolutely agree.  If religion is your main reason to do anything in politics, it means you shouldnt be forcing that "anything" on everyone else.
Yes. 
About time.  The Democratic Party is corrupt as fuck.
The general pattern of the last six months has been "if something big and bad for Donnie is about to break, bring up Hillary". I wonder what's coming next.
Hopefully indictments. 
Why can't the DoJ/FBI investigate? Why do you think a special counsel is needed?

careful.  if there's any way this can be derailed, McCain and Graham will find it.  besides, higher level Dems are never successfully prosecuted
Lol.. He's doing it to himself. Maybe someone should take his Twitter account away from him, at least for a little while.

The media crave circus, circus means ratings, and Trump gives them circus every day. It's not exactly surprising they're taking on his offer.

In fact, when Trump leaves his position one day (when his term is over, or any other reason), I expect a complete media meltdown. Not just newsmedia, but also a bunch of talk shows, and late night entertainment shows are currently completely dependent on Trump doing a bunch of stupid things as the President every week.

Without Trump, I expect a huge tectonic shift in TV. Many shows will lose a ton of viewership and be taken off air. I suppose that in this way, at least, Trump has created "some jobs".

Eh, these shows and operations didn't start up just to criticize Trump. It's not like cnn, abc, Washington Post, nyt, etc. started this year. This isn't their first circus. They'll find another. 
Well I don't mean to say CNN will die... but let's take the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

It used to be third in ratings behind non-political late night shows, and the producers were pushing Colbert *hard* to abandon the political content in attempt to gain wider appeal.

But look at it now: more political than ever, talking about Trump every night, and AFAIK has the best late night show ratings right now. Trump circus sells.
Sure, of course it sells. My point was just that we are at high water now, we weren't in a drought before.

Before Trump, a show such as the late show was like a store that sold donuts and was doing ok. Then Trump came along--the store secured a deal with suppliers that also allowed them to sell cake-- and business boomed. When the deal ends and isn't renewed, they just go back to selling donuts. The cake buyers will go somewhere else, and the shop will go back to being just fine selling donuts.
Some republicans have proved to me to be pansies, after not passing repeal it's time for the RINOS to go... Especially John McCain 
I think you're misunderstanding what GDP is. From Econ101, GDP is the sum of all transactions in an economy. The formual is literally: government spending + consumer spending + investment spending + net exports. Switching from Medicare/Medicaid to private doesn't drive down healthcare expenditure of the economy because your shifting the $$ spent from government spending to consumer spending. Another way to think of this is, people still get sick irrespective of who pays. Hence, everyone needs to focus on lowering COSTS not who pays, because in either case (government or individual), you will end up paying in the end. 
Government isn't hte problem. The problem is healthcare is not amenable to S+D policies; the invisible hand doesn't work at producing an optimal outcome and any economist will tell you that. The healthcare market is not a perfectly competitive market; recall what defines a perfect market: 

1. have undifferentiated/easily substitutable goods - for the major drug costs in healthcare, that is not the case. You cannot substitute Gleevec with an alternate, as there are patents that prevent it.

2. buyers have complete price information - no one, not even doctors know prices due to health insurers constantly. Unlike the airline industry where you can instantly compare ticket prices, healthcare prices are opaque even to people in it.

3. all firms are price takers - untrue also. Due to patents, firms can set prices and charge numbers as high as 500,000 (like Soliris). Also patients automatically pay because they need to get better. Hence, hospitals like MGH can charge 3x more than other Boston areas hospitals.
 
4. many firms - not really. Much of pharma is a monopoly.

5. low barriers to entry - no. the cost to produce/create drugs (3.2 billion dollars) plus the large amounts of regulation is a huge impediment to entry. Same thing with to trying to start a hospital.

In other words, currently, the way healthcare is set up does not allow for supply and demand so companies are allowed to run wild, costs will continue to increase higher than everywhere else, which is literally what has happened. The US spends more $$ than every other developed country per capita, for far less healthier people on average, not because of government or whatever, but because the free-markets allow it to be this much higher. Hence, you need some corrective force in this case. It could be government intervention or other means. For ex, you could get rid of the entire patent system, criteria 1,3 and 4 could be optimized, resulting in a more competitive market and significantly lower costs, though there is a risk of who now funds innovation. Criteria 2 is being worked on but is still way too complicated and criteria 5 will never go away due to the nature of it being healthcare.
I'm not misunderstanding at all. Look at the numbers in terms of dollars spent per person covered, if you like. The point remains the same. 

Driving costs down is obviously the best course, but again, for all their price fixing and "negotiating power", Medicare and Medicaid are clearly not getting the job done as well as private insurance is, according to the spending growth year over year. Even nations with single-payer coverage monopolies are seeing spending grow more than US private insurance (which is, itself, growing faster than self-insurance). 
Tiny repeal was ridiculous and would never have passed in congress.

Now congress will be able to focus on tax reform and infrastructure.


McCain and Ryan are traitors and are exactly what is wrong with the Republican Party. They would have loved Hillary as president so they could keep winning elections and suckling at the government teat for the rest of their lives. We need term limits in the Senate now.
&gt; McCain and Ryan are traitors 

There is a reason why treason is defined in the Constitution and the only crime so defined. It is destructive to our system and society to call political disagreement treason. 

BTW, Ryan?


&gt; The media crave circus,

The media craves circus because circus sells. You place your blame in the wrong place.
So a show might slide in the ratings. That is not "the media", that is "a show".

I never said they committed treason. Just that they are traitors to their voting base. Mostly McCain less Ryan (though he is still doing what he can to subvert the current administration's agenda)
Oh I see what you meant. I misunderstood.

However, your analysis is flawed because you're using incorrect metrics. Per person, yes the average cost per private insurance patient is substantially lower than Medicare/Medicaid. You interpreted it to mean that Medicare/Medicaid is inefficient, but you're overlooking demographics. Reality is, the baseline health of people on Medicare/Medicaid is much worse than those on private insurance, so you need to normalize for that. Medicare = old people, medicaid = poor people, both unhealthy cohorts. This is what makes Medicare/aid seem expensive. Similarly, if you had a program that obese people were treated, it would have extraordinary costs but that's because obese people are expensive to treat. 

Consequently, the proper comparison is how much is spent on equivalent procedures, which normalizes out the baseline health. And the numbers are also well known. Medicaid and Medicare ARE substantially cheaper than private insurance per equivalent procedure. Medicaid reimburses around 60% of private insurance and Medicare about 85-90%, depending on studies. That is, private insurance pays substantially more than either. Hence, switching everyone currently on entitlement programs to private insurance would cause the healthcare costs for those patients to increase between 30-60%.
Imagine privatizing the fire service because you don't want to have to pay to put out someone else's house since yours is never on fire. 

One day your house is up in flames, the firefighters come, and you find out you can only afford to put out the garage because your neighbor doesn't want to help share the cost. 

You live in your garage now, from time to time your neighbor stops by to remind you that you should have worked harder. 
Someone who is a traitor is someone who commits treason.
Captured in Vietnam, tortured, refused to break, and so committed to the people he continued his service in elected office while often vilified by certain high profile persons and organisations; sometimes justly; sometimes not; but John McCain is a "pansy". Sure, okay, whatever.
So now because he was captured 50 years ago means he's not a pansy in the present?  Sure, okay, whatever. He's a RINO
However, the healthcare vote was to provide the structural leeway for tax reform. Now, it's going to be much smaller and narrower in scope. Meanwhile, Trump's infrastructure plan is kind of like a unicorn: often discussed and never seen.
There was no blame, you said the same thing I said. 
Have u seen the economy since he got in office tho...or the employment rate
Putin and trump are two based peas in an alpha dawg pod!
Employment is down about half a percent and GDP is said to come in at 2.9. Looks good, but I think we need to give the administration a year before we can truly measure their success or failure. 
Fair enough...
"The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." -- Mitch McConnell, Oct. 23, 2010
Funny how good presidents don't provide fodder for satire. What is your point?
Entirely different situation. Healthcare is more affordable and higher quality with less regulation. Single-payer systems always have terrible quality healthcare.
I think this is actually a legitimate action, because of the way that the Administration attacks institutions.  

This is banana-republic kind of shit.  Attacking institutions is your way of gaining control of them - you point to the established way of doing it, and rather than 'fixing' it (whatever you choose to believe that means) and working within the existing system (we call this "democracy") you attack it so you can create your own system - which you then control.

Control to what end?  And that's the question to be asked.  

It makes sense for an overwhelmingly elected president to have the power and authority to do this.  It does not make sense for a President who barely wins his election to do this.  
What's wrong with wanting Hillary as President?  You disagree with her, but that makes them a traitor?  

"Term limits" are your way of controlling people you disagree with.  Why are you so obsessed with dictating to other people?
It's important to draw that first sentence all the way out to the end - a for-profit media craves ratings.  Part of the problem is that information is governed by the market instead of importance/significance.  Perhaps some of the stories Republicans want suppressed wouldn't be reported as vociferously if the profit motive wasn't so strong to get them.  The voters in the aggregate certainly seemed eager enough to not have Trump, so I'd imagine they are equally eager to hear about his fuckups.  "Opinion confirmed"
[removed]
If single payer is always terrible why do many of the countries ranked highest in healthcare have some form of single payer, and why is the US ranked so low? 
I realize this angle, so when I hear a "Trump screw-up" news, I always put this through a mental filter "would this be reported this way if it was George Bush, Obama, Bill Clinton? Is it a real screw-up". And in about 20% of cases, it's someone trying too hard to manufacture a bad event around Trump... but the problem is that in 80% of the cases it is a real screw-up. 

There was also a gradual change in the media attitude over time. It wasn't like this in the first days of his presidency. He wasn't openly mocked. There were no calls for him to step down. After two centuries of utmost respect to the president, and utmost care of every president about what he says to the public, there are two mutually supporting assertions media expected to occur:

- If we criticize the president, we criticize the institution of the president and this is not acceptable by the public.
- If we criticize the president, he'll self-correct, so we'll see less PR, political and so on screw-ups.

Well, with every next reported Trump mishap, the public didn't react negatively, and Trump didn't correct himself. So the media adjusted their behavior. And suddenly we have what we have today: a full onslaught.

The media is just what their name says - they mediate between the people who watch the news and the people who make the news. 

So the reason we see what we see is because that's what Trump continues to act like, and that's how much respect the public has for him. He undid 200 years of unconditional respect to the institution of the presidency. If a piece of cardboard was elected as a president, the media wouldn't have so many reasons to be negative about it as they are with Trump.
Hillary Clinton is a criminal and this has been known since the 90's. and enacting term limits is the far opposite of enacting a controlling dictatorship. With term limits, a small group of people can not stay in power for decades and grow corruption.  
&gt;Hillary Clinton is a criminal and this has been known since the 90's.

OK, well this is factually incorrect - a criminal is a person who has committed a crime, and under our legal system a crime is only found to have been comitted in a court of law.  So let's put that aside.  Again, what is wrong with wanting Hillary Clinton to be President?  Why are you on a Taliban-like crusade of ideological purity?  

&gt;With term limits, a small group of people can not stay in power for decades and grow corruption.

I think what you mean to say is, "without elections" - and that's exactly what you want, to control elections.  Only the candidates *you* approve of get to run.  It's like the Islamic Revolutionary Council of Iran - you want to sign off on the candidates ahead of time.  No thank, Ayatollah.  I'll stick with the voters electing whoever they want.  Many people said that Trump shouldn't be allowed to run because he had no relevant experience (and now he admits that freely, so it turns out they were right).  Are you suggesting they should have been allowed to block him?
&gt;(though he is still doing what he can to subvert the current administration's agenda)

How so? 
Any system that emphasizes third party reimbursement will perpetuate inflation. Someone else is paying for syndrome.

Also with any new health "care" plan one has to realize that it is not plug in and play. The countries that use the different systems have different demographics, politics, taxes, geography etc. It won't simply be a transfer or conversion to another system.

And last but not least these universal healthcare or single payer reduce or eliminate free market/choice and get the government deeper into one's life.
Aaaaaaand he's gone
Has brain cancer surgery and then comes back to vote nay on the health care bill. Maybe that surgery did some good after all.  Thank you sir
Interesting testimony. I didn't realize his natural cadence was actually that slow. Nowadays he'd be accused of having a Valium addiction.
Some things have changed since 1969.  Namely, we all have at least 100 channels and nobody watches sesame street anymore.
I agree completely, but we lost this argument decades ago.  We'll never go back unless the country falls apart.  We can try to apply conservative principles to the eventual universal care we get, or we can kick and scream from our minority position that we'll be stuck with for a generation if an O-care repeal is passed that doesn't increase people covered AND lowers costs.   
Do you have numbers that support that?
Well, at it's height in 1985 about 8 percent of the US tuned in to the show. I would say if you have a bunch of programs that get part of the way to the solution then you are better off than when you started.
Yes.

Zero.
Ugh. I am really annoyed by the expanding scope of the "fake news" tag. This was inaccurate certainly and I believe has been corrected. Journalists should be better about checking all possible avenues before publishing, but the pressure to get the story out is very high. 

Fake News in the terms of the election and in general should be limited to shit like "Obama bans pledge of allegiance" on sites that try to look like they are other, more reputable, news sites.
 http://abcnews.com.co/obama-executive-order-bans-pledge-of-allegiance-in-schools/

There is a difference between lazy reporting, an error of omission and wholesale fabrication. To lump them all together is dangerous to our democracy. If we paint everything as completely unreliable then there is no more truth and we will loose an important piece of our democracy. 

When the mob wants their health care you had better give it to them or else.

Some how they've turned dependence on government into a desire. Many look at it as the government providing a service never mind but somebody else is paying for it including other tax payers that don't need health care and alot of other things. 

 Government should be the back up plan, not the primary
This is argument misses a lot of points.  Healthcare need not be funded by the Gov't since it is actually funded by the taxes of the people that pay the gov't to even exist in the first place.  The gov't decides how to spend your money they receive.  The dependence argument is nonsensical since heath care has gotten so explosively expensive, mainly due to insurance companies.  Eliminate a middle man and the costs drop immensely.  Think wholesale over retail.  I'm not arguing for or against, just stating that the gov't already takes your money.  Why not have them spend it on things that benefit the whole?  They will keep taking your money, no matter your party affiliation.  Stop giving agencies that say they don't need or want the money when it could be used for things that improve our lot as a whole.  United we stand, divided we fall.  We are the most powerful country on earth and we treat our populace as second class citizens.  It's time to make gov't use the money we are forced to give for us as a country.  I never get the argument that this is a bad thing.  We already give them the money, for what?  Defense is covered and billions still remain.  Give it back to the people that put it in.  Seems like a no brainer to me.  But what the heck do I know?  I just pay my taxes and see no benefit from all of the money I spend besides going to war in countries we should not be in.  This isn't partisan since both parties have kept us in other countries and allowed our men to die for their own greed.  I'm greedy too, give me back my money or use it on me.  Stop giving it to others when we are the ones that are paying.
Fred "cuck" rogers is the epitome of being a beta male 
I don't believe any actual news outlets ran that story. 
The government should begin taxing all employee benefits, even healthcare, and then let's talk about a free market solution. 
idk i dont watch the news, but chelsea clinton and j.k rowling where blowing up twitter over it. 
If Mr Trump is the ideal of an alpha male, I think Mr Rogers would consider that a compliment.
Yeah.  No actual news outlets ran it.  Chelsea and Rowling aren't news.  Just dumb liberals that fell for a deceptive tweet.  By now, when a Trump supporter says something is "fake news", I assume an actual news organization reported something that actually happened.  


To be fair im sick of the term FAKE News also, I'm Canadian so idk if i can  say im a trump supporter. i do agree with his political views compared to the Liberal ones.
Doubting news sources because they are generally unreliable is not a threat to our democracy, it may be the only thing that will save us.  Fox News, CNN, MSNBC are all leaning very far on their chosen sides of the two party system.  It is important people are aware of these biases, and seeking out actual verification to their stories.

For example, when CNN showed a Trump supporter punching a protestor I went straight to YouTube to see the whole story... a protestor wearing a KKK outfit gets punched by a black man.  10 years ago I would've never considered checking this story, but since I know how fake the news is nowadays I was ready to be skeptical.  Nothing CNN was a lie, but there was definitely a spin to that story that I think fits nicely under the umbrella term 'fake news'.
You say thelat healthcar is now so expensive.. yeah it is..because the government got involved in it. Back when insurance was privatized without all the government regulation, insurance costs weren't actually that bad at all. Since the government started regulating things, costs have shot though the roof because the government sucks at running healthcare. Just look at the VA or at Medicaid...both ration like crazy and cost the country a ton because government sucks.
Maybe because "alarmism" is the wrong word?
So, you feel that this describes the left: "defined by rage, bitterness and hate against another group of people".

Look at this sub. It's called "Republicans". Yet 95% of the topics are "here's a bad thing a democrat did" and "here's why you should hate the left". It even applies to your own post, OP.

What does that tell you? Nietzche wasn't describing just the left. He was describing all of us.
Even just make some unverifiable event up if you have to about you and your dad when you were 6 going to out to the Catskills.

"If we require immigrants to speak English, does that mean we're only going to accept people from Great Britain and Australia?"

What a complete idiot. After Mandarin, English is the most widely spoken language in the world, even outside of England and Australia, and this guy, who's job it is to report facts, thinks that no one outside a few countries speaks English?

Now I understand why Spicer removed the cameras. The press briefings are for the media to ask questions of the administration, but hacks like Acosta just use it as a soapbox to virtue signal their bleeding heart liberalism.

Newsflash, the US isn't a global charity or dumping ground. No one has a right to come here unless we, as a society, agree they can come here. We should accept immigrants...who can improve the country, and the chance of them doing so increases if they have marketable skills, a work ethic, and an ability to communicate with other Americans. Saying, "no job? no skills? can't communicate with anyone? no problem! we'll figure that all out later!", is complete lunacy.

Folks like Acosta love to quote the Statue of Liberty, as though it were a legal document, but they ignore the actual immigration policies in force when it was an immigration port of entry. We had strict standards, both in health and intelligence, and those that didn't measure up where sent back. And all that happened under liberal messiah, President FDR.

So few people watch Sesame Street HBO picked up partial distribution rights for it.

Get your alternative facts outta here.
Miller should not have allowed Jim FakeNews Acosta to have that much platform
Thanks for making my point for me.  According to PBS:

"The deal helped keep the financially unstable show afloat"

"Jeffrey Dunn, the CEO of Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that produces the show, said he talked with the public broadcaster last winter about the workshop's worsening budget shortfalls. "

"The losses just kept getting bigger," 

"If we don't find another way to replace this revenue stream, then we either have to shut the show down or..."

According to PBS, there are several more popular shows among its 2- to 5-year-old viewers, including "Curious George," "Daniel Tiger," and "Wild Kratts." 

Get all that?  Sesame Street isn't even in the top 3 children's shows ON THAT CHANNEL.  If you want to call me wrong, how about backing it up?

http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/13/media/sesame-street-public-broadcasting-hbo/index.html
Miller should not be allowed to speak to the press.

That was dreadfully embarrassing.
Holy shit that was incredible.

I bet it is because he's used to debates since High School. He thinks he should debate reporters when he only must give an answer then discard them &amp; move on to another reporter.
Discourse goes both ways.  We expect the reader to respect our views and our person's, even if they disagree, but we must also return that respect.  Most often discourse fails only when both sides no longer respect each other.  When one side continues to respectfully point out the other's disrespect (and how it fails to make a compelling point, convince others, or show the argued in any kind of a respectable light), very often the other can be persuaded to respond respectfully, or they back off completely.

I have found respect to be a very rewarding ground to argue from,
while I mostly agree, what is not mentioned is that Dems don't care about, don't want to get to answers.  they're totally stuck pitching agenda

and I don't disagree with them.  it works...it works...it works
You're part of the problem.
u r weird
Since Obama was elected the Democratic Party has lost over 1,000 seats across this country.  They don't give a single fuck about the American people, the fact that the American people are telling them to fuck off in record numbers verifies that.
Democrat.  so it doesn't matter.  she'll skate free
Ant legitimate sources covering this?  Neither Kim Dot Com nor gatweay pundit are very credible. 
It definitely doesn't help the matter when all we do is replace one "swamp monster" (i.e., Lynch) for another (i.e., Sessions). 
Unfortunately, alternative media is the **only** "legitimate source" these days. Everything else is Deep State propaganda. 
we'll see.  Trump was/is crazy mad at Sessions for not prosecuting...and goodness knows, it's not like the list was a mystery of who should go to jail
Typical liberal traitors
&gt;Trump was/is crazy mad at Sessions for not prosecuting...

And rightfully so. Which leads me to believe that Sessions himself is implicated in the all of the HRC/DWS/Awan/Lynch/Comey fuckery. 
What if I told you the "deep state" is an intentionally vague and nebulous boogey man designed to always be an adversary that could be valiantly fought but never defeated. What I'm saying is it doesn't exist. Also, media outlets that don't confirm your positions are not necessarily propaganda.  Breitbart and GatewayPundit, which can be reliably counted on to advance a certain view point, are propaganda.  The MSM is not.

 There are about 2 sources in all of those that have even a shred of credibility.  Interesting enough, neither of those two support your argument as I understand it.  In fact, your argument is self defeating.  Our party controls all branches of government.  If what you claim were true, we'd be seeing a deluge of media about how awesome and right their policies are and their results. We don't see that.  

Now, are there bureaucrats who disagree with the administration and push back or leak information?  Yes, of course there are.  It happens with every administration.  Obama prosecuted more leakers than anyone.  The administration could mitigate this by using actual facts and numbers when justifying its policies.  It currently tends to exaggerate and embellish its supporting facts.  (Using 1 in 5 working age adults is unemployed to justify immigration drawdown, ignoring the unemployment rate, early retirees, and stay at home parents.)


I've voted Republican my entire life and even I have to agree that our party has shown hostility to actual answers.  When the guy "leading" your party consistently supports his arguments with incorrect numbers and alternative facts we don't get to pretend we're the rational ones. 
yup.  just a recent example of what drives me nuts

Democrats get their way even in minority...always get their way
Impeachment? That's not really a coup, is it? 
Impeachment for what?  
[deleted]
I think obstruction of justice is the soup of the day 
A piece of advice, don't order the soup of the day.  Its just a load of bullshit with some water.
When drug and insurance companies cut a deal to maximize their profits, no one is looking out for the public. 

This is one reason the free market isn't working when it comes to health care. We need either a single payer option with government oversight on pricing or more regulation to outlaw this practice. 
Notice in a week when these revelations come out the attacks on conservative news personalities are ramped up. They are desperately trying to control a narrative of evil conservatives who "colluded" with the enemy. 

One must also wonder what else she has lied about to say the least. 


OK, OK, OK, we know.  just wake if any Democrat does serious jail time
Lock. Her. Up. 
I don't know, there's so many accusations, but that's the only way a coup could legitimately happen, aside from some political internal threat b.s. that forces one to step down. Then again, 'legitimately happen' sort of juxtaposes the nature of a coup. 
Where is our TruePundit app ???
No single payer or more regulation. There are laws against price fixing and market manipulation which aren't enforced enough. 

Big Pharma was the big holdout in Obama Care, if anyone needs to be investigated for collusion it's big pharma, big insurance and big government.
Trump has been doing well without congress
Trump has been doing ~~well without Congress~~ Nothing.

FTFY
You might be correct, but if there are laws in place to correct this practice, why have they never been enforced? 
Unacceptable, if true. 
Seems like bullshit. If you have a case, you prosecute a case. Setting for a piece of paper that says "I committed a crime" makes no sense. 
If you believe that you're not paying attention.  Trump has accomplished a fuck ton of things his supporters wanted him to do.

Perhaps it's better people like you remain ignorant of this and just complain about his tweets all day.  Trump is dismantling the Obama legacy and you folks are focused on whatever dumb shit John Oliver is telling you.

&gt; Though Google, being a private company, reserves the right to fire anyone on such grounds

California is an at-will State, so anyone can be terminated at any time, for any reason. 

Even if his views had merit, releasing and circulating the memo at work creates animosity between employees and is a disruption in the workplace. That's enough cause to terminate this guy, regardless of content. Now if this guy had posted it to his personal blog outside of work hours, then we'd have a true first amendment argument, (though Google still has the right to fire him, regardless). 
Eh... it's New York. The people who recognized her probably legitimately didn't give a shit. It's not uncommon to see an A-List celebrity walk around completely unnoticed.
I am honestly sickened anytime someone brings up an irrelevant character attack. 

"What's the point of this?"

"Well, first I need to point out that earlier today, Hillary Clinton said she's considering being a pastor. Maybe she's trying to absolve herself of sin."

No, you don't *need* to point that out when being question on the importance of this. No, you don't *need* to act as judge and jury and plant the seed of guilt in viewers' mind. 

Just answer the question that it's the judge's opinion that a thorough investigation hasn't been done and for the sake of proper governance the rule of law must be respected. 
Were any of these inappropriate or illegal? What do you think /u/Wannabe2good?
How do we have the footage then?!? This is bugging me out. 
Did she change parties? Why do we care? 
America first!
I'd say dismantling Obama's legacy is not something I care about.  He is in a position to improve the insurance market and can't.  He is funneling our tax dollars yo his businesses.  He is squandering our soft power and international influence. He's trying to revive a dead industry that should be allowed to die.  He's been exposed as a liar on the wall.  

All he's done so far is roll back regulations, really.  And while I think we are probably over regulated, a blanket removal is stupid.   Every regulation ever written was written for a reason, they can't all be bad.  

Cool thing about John Oliver is how well researched his segments are.  Could you point out how he's wrong on any of them?
I saw a claim but not an explanation.  There are literally thousands of media outlets competing with each other. That's the exact opposite of monopoly, even a figurative one.  One would be forgiven for assuming that this ex-Russian was making a case for  state run media.  Which is a monopoly and is propaganda.  I'll take a hard pass.
The deep state doesn't exist.  It's a fake boogey man designed to give the administration something to fight and blame.  
&gt;He is in a position to improve the insurance market and can't.

He's been in office for just over 6 months.  Saying "he can't" is just foolish.

&gt;He is funneling our tax dollars yo his businesses. 

I assume you're talking about how he stays at his own resorts?  His security detail is going to be expensive no matter where he goes, why is it an issue that he chooses to go to his own resorts?  Are you aware that he donates any profit made from foreign leaders visiting him at his resorts to the Treasury?  

&gt;He is squandering our soft power and international influence.

How so?

&gt;He's trying to revive a dead industry that should be allowed to die. 

The people that work in the coal industry certainly don't have an issue with Trump trying to bring back their jobs.  And I would suggest you become informed on the technological breakthroughs with clean coal.

https://www.wired.com/2014/03/clean-coal/

Trump has reduced illegal immigration, removed the U.S. from the Paris Accord which saddled the American taxpayer with foreign debts and allowed other nations to continue to grow their fossil fuel emmissions, pulled us out of TPP, GDP growth has already surpassed any growth under Obama, the stock market is at a record high, unemployment at record lows, consumer confidence is up, and companies are reinvesting in America.  

&gt;Every regulation ever written was written for a reason

A lot of regulations are written because of crony capitalism.  Want a perfect example, look at ISP's.  What regulations has Trump removed that you believe to be "stupid"?

&gt;Cool thing about John Oliver is how well researched his segments are. Could you point out how he's wrong on any of them?

The easiest example would be his episode on refugees.  This entire episode isn't based on facts whatsoever and time has shown him to be wrong on nearly every opinion he has on the matter.

https://www.google.com/amp/amp.dailycaller.com/2015/09/30/watch-john-oliver-destroy-his-own-credibility-over-migrant-crisis/

You really don't see that Oliver is giving you one ultra biased side of the story?  
I mean improve the market.  A clean repeal won't improve it by any measure.  The experts and most Republicans understand that.  That's why they couldn't pass it.  In order to get the improvements he promised the law will have to move further to the left.   He can't promise to both repeal it and lower costs, it's mathematically impossible.

Security is expensive.  I've no problem with security costs for the President.  I have no problem with him taking vacations; a President is on the clock 24/7 and technology means his job goes with him. That's fine.  I find it extremely hypocritical for him to take more vacation and play more golf than the guy he spent years decrying for taking too much vacation.  It's also extremely unethical to spend that much money at his resorts when there are less expensive options a available.  He has a responsibility to be a good steward of our money, especially when he has full control of how its spent.  Instead, he spends it at places where he personally benefits, and then donates his paltry salary like that balances it out. It doesn't.  He has also raised the rates for places he frequents and until someone called him out on it the State Dept encouraged dignitaries to stay there on its official site.   

He ceded our leadership role on climate by withdrawing form Paris, and justified it with provably false claims on the costs. Lies that apparently some people still believe.

Withdrawing from TPP was a gift to the other two major economic powers in the region, China and Russia.  They will dictate the terms of the eventual trade pact that governs the region.  We will miss out out on huge emerging markets.  

His rhetoric has made several European countries already decide the US is unreliable.  "Good" you say, but if they can't count on us being in their corner there's not much reason for them abide our wishes when we need them. The United States is supposed to be the grown up in the room, but his tendency to speak loudly and carry a little stick is not helping. Now China's the grownup regarding NK.  He sunk to Kim's level with ridiculous rhetoric. 

There's no evidence his emphasis on reducing immigration will have positive results, even if it was a promise.  I understand why people who believe it will be good are happy he kept that promise, but it doesn't mean it will be good.   Most experts believe it will have a negative impact. 

Fun fact, his administrations switch to focus on all immigrants instead of just the felons had actually slowed down the rate of deportations because the courts are clogged.

   He hasn't passed anything of note to impact the overall economy.  He can't claim credit for gains in GDP, unemployment, confidence, or the stock market and be taken seriously.  

His regulatory roll back could be well done, but health, safety, and environmental regulations exist for good reason.  So do regs on wall street aimed at reducing the probability of another crash.  With a good argument backed by hard numbers, by all means convince me.  But "ugh...regulations bad" is not an argument. 

There's no such thing as clean coal.  It can be made cleaner relative to 100 years ago, but it cannot be clean.  Especially since excessive CO2 levels are contributing to climate change.  Solar and wind and both far cleaner.  There's no reason to pursue coal.  I know why miners are behind it, coal put food in my belly when I was young.  But its time is past.  Even China and India are cancelling coal plants, despite their growth. 


I expect bias in all my media.  What matters to me is how well its sourced.  You counter his bias with a far more biased source, because the daily caller is know to write stories without good sourcing.  At least the limey uses reputable sources.

Your entire post is your opinion that is based on Democratic Party talking points of which you use verbatim.

Your only link is an opinion piece from a climate change activist while you bring up sourcing and bias.

That is the most ridiculous attempt at a rebuttal I've seen in some time.  Would you like to try again when you have time?  Or are you just lazy and don't want to inform yourself instead of relying on talking points from politicians and John Oliver?
Your only links were opinion pieces from unreliable sources.  You don't get to hold me to a higher standard than you hold yourself.
The wired article simply explains how clean coal works, how is that biased?  

The Daily caller article cites Reuters, The Economist, and even the Council of Foreign Relations.  

You're lazy and when faced with an opportunity to become informed you shy away and make up excuses.

Daily caller does cite them sometimes, and then completely misrepresents what they cite.  I've read them.  I've witnessed it.  The uninformed one here is you.
Your first link is an opinion piece and even the first paragraph is an opinion that doesn't even factor in clean coal use.  

The first clean coal factory didn't even open up until January of this year, yet an opinion piece from 2014 says there is proof in West Virginia that it's dirty and harmful.  Do I really need to explain how idiotic that is? 
Sure.  Please do.  Tell me how the mining itself isn't dirty and harmful.  Tell me how the stoichiometry results in no pollutants.  Clean coal is cleaner than old coal, but it's still coal and not as clean as any of our other alternatives.  Even natural gas is cleaner.  Clean coal is a myth as marketed, and we didn't have to have a plant to know that. 

I'm from a strip mine town.  I know what it looks like, I know about the run-off and spills. I know reclaimed land doesn't come close to its former biodiversity. The top soil layer isn't deep enough to support much more than prairie grass.

Here, here.  We need to root these people out of the party, and that includes people that won't condemn them.
this story is getting massive coverage

reason:  it's a right wing story

we would **NEVER EVER** see such tainted coverage for left wing activities like black lives matter

btw, there would have been zero violence without the left wing being there too

you won't hear that mentioned anywhere
So what you're saying is your left wing if you're not racist?  And going out to make sure people understand that there are more non racist than racist is bad and causes the racist to get violent because their safe space was violated?  Interesting.  Explains a lot.  Your statement is very telling.
"Well said, fellow comrade"
racism/slavery started with and is still with Democrats, e.g. KKK

so I have zero idea what agenda you're hoping to sell
History 101: [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy)  The Republican party and the Democratic party of today are not the same as they were then.  Any half assed attempt at studying history shows this.  I have no agenda, was just pointing out that to be violent, you have to be a lefty?  I find that odd.  I'm not a dem or a rep, i'm independent and vote for the person, not the party.  Our constitution was a liberal idea, just an fyi.  I am more liberal than conservative when it comes to social issues and watching and hearing people defend two things the USA has fought against and liberated from is just absurd.  Blaming the left for a guy running over people is just ridiculous though.
**Southern strategy**

In American politics, the southern strategy was a Republican Party electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans. As the Civil Rights Movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened pre-existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South to the Republican Party that had traditionally supported the Democratic Party. It also helped push the Republican Party much more to the right.

In academia, "southern strategy" refers primarily to "top down" narratives of the political realignment of the South, which suggest that Republican leaders consciously appealed to many white southerners' racial resentments in order to gain their support.

Uh, ok? Who's ever said otherwise? We all agree.
I watched some old PBS Newshour videos of the Dallas shooting of 5 police officers, from about a year ago, and the contrast was very stark. The never once mentioned "terrorism". No mention of Obama. No mention of any other violence from the left. No clips of Black Lives Matter supporters shouting "die whitey die". No one asking if Democrats should disavow racists among their ranks. Very interesting.

Flash forward one year, and the reporting makes Charlottesville look like it was personally ordered by Trump while he was attending a KKK rally. Trump comes out and immediately condemns it, and they play several clips of politicians and pundits saying he's not condemning it...enough. Yep, there's no such thing as the liberal media alright...
It started with conservatives who thought that owning people was just fine. 
When did U.S. conservatism give up on supporting Lee and the Lost Cause? When did conservatives stop saying we need  to keep honoring those people?

Anyway, here is Trump on those rac ists:

&gt;My administration is restoring the sacred bonds of loyalty between this nation and its citizens, but our citizens must also restore the bonds of trust and loyalty between one another. We must love each other, respect each other, and cherish our history and our future together. So important. We have to respect each other. Ideally, we have to love each other.

Did you see it? Because the racists marching sure saw it.

&gt;cherish our history

That is their explicit cover story for keeping the statues. Trump went out of his way to make a clear open claim of solidarity with the KKK and Nazis marching to defend racism.


I have no room for virtue signalling faggots.
Wow, delusional 100%. The boogie man of "regulations" is clearly your obsession.

Yup, regulations cause fewer ISP choices, sure, buddy. Because we all want 100 cables running to every house.

Do some research, them come argue with the adults.
No one cares about your opinion. 
No one cares about yours, cuck.
we/this sub should not cover CNN
"Brave"

Like the kind of bravery it takes to constantly stage violent protests and espouse an ideology that killed orders of magnitude more people in the 20th century than Nazism.

Who should we use?  
In fairness, facing down a militia that shows up with firearms takes some balls.  Unite the Right was started with the intention of instigating violence and they miscalculated, badly. 
 I've read it was organized by a liberal who organized Occupy. 
The dude has a well documented history in the far right. The "liberal setup" line has been pushed by THAT sub, you know the one, and other people desperate to distance their normal non-lethal bigotry from the lethal kind. 

https://amp.businessinsider.com/who-is-jason-kessler-unite-the-right-charlottesville-2017-8
Agreed.  They are a fake news organization filled with idiots and their idiotic opinions.  
No. I checked. The SPLC did an article on him. He was most defiantly a liberal who helped organize occupy, and supported Obama who claimed to have had a total ideological turnaround in the last few years.  

I'm not accusing one way or the other, however I find it fishy when someone with that much passion behind one idea has such a sudden and radical change of heart. 
&gt;Unite the Right was started with the intention of instigating violence and they miscalculated, badly.

I've watched several videos in the aftermath as well as watching it live the day of, the far left loons were the ones instigating violence and they went there with the intention of being violent.

Not a single act of violence would have taken place without the presence of ANTIFA and the rest of the morons that followed them.

I can't believe the Washington Post has actually stated real facts in regards to ANTIFA, but here it is.  These people are a domestic terror organization who preplans violent attacks.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/08/13/fear-of-violent-left-preceded-events-in-charlottesville/
If I'm reading the same one you read, the connection is weak at best, but he does mention his "red pilling" (I hate that term) happened in 2013.  Given the populist roots of Occupy and the populist Trump campaign I can see the overlap.  

That's a lot of foresight to infiltrate and start this 4 years later, though.
The torches transmitted a very specific message, and that message was about as inflammatory as you could possibly get without physically assaulting someone.  That was planned instigation.   
Protests by their very nature are a tool to instigate.  They used the torches at night by the way, the violence started during the day so that destroys your argument.

It's pretty common to use a source of light at night to help see, just a reminder in case you haven't put that one together yet.
Because the counter protestors are goldfish and completely forgot about the torches from the previous night.  The armed militia was also totally not instigating.

The women's march was a protest.  There was zero instigation there.

I've voted Republican my whole life but of there is a "side" to blame it was the "Unite the Right" crowd.  Intentionally provocative and philosophically wrong. I'd rather not have their votes and lose than have them and win.
The amount of these people within the Republican Party and in this country is so miniscule it's laughable that you believe they could sway any election.

And they support people based on their racism and bigotry, not party affiliation.  David Duke supported three Democrats just for the DNC Chairman position because of their history of bigotry towards Jews.  

This doesn't have anything to do with Trump or the Republican Party.  What the hell are you talking about?

Read up buddy, you're extremely uninformed on what has been going on.

I honestly don't know how people can continue to be so fucking stupid and believe the media anymore.  There is no excuse for it anymore.

I think all the intelligent people have backed away and have tuned off from the far left media and now only the idiots are left, which is why we are only seeing these assholes like the people in Charlotte.

The Nazis have always been idiots too and now they are trying to one up the leftists with their idiocy.

It's just a bunch of assholes and idiots left.
I keep seeing him condemn the actions in Charlottesville but leftist say he won't do it even though it's the first thing he did. 

These people are living in the twilight zone. If I have to live with this shit for another 50-60 years I will sign up early for a civil war if it ever kicks off. It's getting old. Tired of trying to work with these people. They are under a delusion of false oppression and fantasy. 

They vote for a women who brags about her gay rights and anti racist ideals... While taking donations in the millions from Saudi Arabia where they kill and torture gays.She has been quoted calling black people "Super predators" and expressed in the past if her daughter married a black man she would be extremely disappointed. She was also in a sorority type group (The southern flower girls or some shit...look it up. The name is wrong and I can't remember it but it's 100% real)  that championed against the civil rights. If Trump had one of those disturbing facts included in his past he would be ridiculed. But liberals are controlling the media and spreading propaganda on a level we have never seen here in the United States. 

They call a ban on certain countries discriminative against a religion that murders people for being gay and committing adultery, or simply being attractive warrants acid attacks on women.( not all are like this but those certain countries have big radical followings.)

Europe is in shambles and has been lost as far as I'm concerned. No wonder Poland and the Slavic countries don't want to take refugees. They don't belong there! 

The destabilization of the Middle East started with Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, but Clinton ruined Libya Egypt and Syria with her shit foreign policy. 

The threat we now face with Russia is at a peak height since the Cold War because Obama was too pussy to react to the annexation of Crimea. And the HUGE threat of an unstable dictator in North Korea is now trump's problem because Clinton and Obama never took the regime seriously and now they threaten Japan and Guam with Nuclear attack. 

I don't give a fuck if a transgender can take a shit in one bathroom or another, I do care that our leaders have the guts to make the hard calls regarding military action that reinforces our power on a world stage. These people and their corrupt leaders will be the downfall of this nation. 

And I will wade in my enemies blood before sharia law becomes reality in this great nation.

Let it be known. There are many of us.

This was a rant and a overreaction. But how much longer will we continue to let these uneducated dreadlock warriors in black mask threaten our democracy with anarchy and a desire to implement socialism. And I highly doubt it would be socialism.

My family survived under Nazi rule, and communist rule in Poland. These antifa terrorist resemble the communist my family dealt with. Even a relative of mine said " Ha, socialism? These are communist that want everyone to be paid poorly and have only the people in power at an advantage." Far left and far right are both very dangerous. 

I believe we need the best of both worlds, but far left is something I would fight against because I think it is more likely a far left government would be elected here now a days.

They promise peace and equality only to develop a society were common folk are oppressed even more than they are today. 

What have dems done for black people? Ffs we had a black President and his hometown is still a murdering shithole. All they want to do is give out food stamps and free housing so they can keep minorities poor but still get their vote. Thankfully some minorities are starting to realize this. 

Thank fuck Trump was elected. He was not my first choice but America will have a big fight against leftist ideology in the coming years and his election stopped it for now.

I can't even watch tv anymore with all the actors spreading leftist propaganda at every award show.

They preach free speech but only when you agree with them.

The year 2017 when antifa communist have more fascist characteristics and influence than nazi's.

What a world we live in. 
He condemned it but he really didn't..yesterday's press conference was a total back pedal..alt right is really his base so he can't condem them to hard..can't wait for pence to take over..trump is doing so much damage to GOP
I said when this story broke that there would have been zero violence if people from the left / alt left had not attacked.  Trump says the same and gets attacked too
DO NOT cover / promote CNN in this sub
Duke is the most famous person you almost never see
next wack job left will want to blow up Mount Rushmore
I disagree with a lot of things in your post, but this is too much:

&gt; These antifa terrorist

As far as I know, the terrorist who drove his car through a group of protesters wasn't antifa. He was a fascist/alt-right/neo-nazi whatever you like. It was a case extreme right terrorism, not antifa terrorism.
Because unfortunately some conservatives (mostly Trump and his base) still try to cover every Trump blunder by attacking Hillary. When will they realize she is just a grandma with no current public job, who happened to loose an election one year ago? Bashing Hillary doesn't serve any other purpose than to make Trump look better whenever he fucks things up.
The same can be said for Trump too. He is not held accountable when he lies.
Indeed, most politicians aren't held accountable, these days.  It's like we figure it's the way it is, so why fight it, rather than saying it's not the way it should be, and making a better political field for everyone.
What is it like to be stupid? You'll live your entire life as a dumbass and always wonder why things don't go in your favor.
"Even fox is a fuck up nowadays",  well pal hate to break it to ya but Fox successfully poisoned the minds of millions of Americans (mostly older ones) with their propaganda.  Combined with the anger and hate on "conservative" radio, the GOP has effectively destroyed a large segment of the less intelligent population which can never again have normal, moderate perspective on any single political or social topic.  Fuck Fox News and the "conservative" media
But you're the smart guy in the room for sure.  You are smart smart they are allllllll dumb dumb.  
that was clearly a grimace...
Oh wow.  You definitely raised the conversation by your insightful comments that said absolutely nothing about the topic, instead focusing on me, whom you have most likely never met.  Are you in Elementary School, or have you never learned that your type of comment actually makes YOU look like:

A) You can't think up a real rebuttal for the discussion

B) You feel personal attacks are an effective form of persuasion

C) You are emotionally invested such that you HAD to comment, but not informed well enough to make a logic based comment.

D) You don't realize your method makes YOU look stupid.

Personal attacks are the weapons of the weak and uninformed.  I don't think that is how you want to be perceived, so I think you should try a different tact.

I don't mind disagreement, as it fosters growth for both sides.  I hope you can step up your game to an actual level of discussion.  I wouldn't mind being wrong, or learning more about both the topic and your views.

Haha ok, my small-brained friend.  Your original comment does not require any counter argument or dissenting opinion  because it clearly illustrates the comprehensive lack of understanding you possess of the role of media.

Agree, the right is not nazis, the alt-right has latched on to the GOP but they are really not republicans 
Haha.  Definitely a trump supporter here.  Hey pal here's some advice, when everyday more and more prominent, qualified and intelligent people staunchly and publicly rebut the "president of the United States" (lol), the less and less legitimate your pathetic, hallow, misguided and shortsighted cause is.  Perhaps taking a big step back and looking at current events through the lens of a moderate person would be helpful, though, you are a trump supporter so I am sure life hasn't been good to you having half a brain and all.  Trump supporters don't get respect anymore.  Un-American.  Disgraceful.  An insult to all those that built this nation before us.  
Dude is a complete dumbass.  Unfortunately we both gave him a response so he's won.  Fuck.  
Well then one of y'all "conservatives" (American conservatism died with HW) should let them know or start a new party.  Sad! 
Yeah.  In situations like this last weekend, any public official, especially the President, only gets one shot.  His first statement was an unforced error.  An OT 4th down fumble on the 1.  There were easy points along with at least a full week of positive press coverage right there for the taking, and he blew it.  
A Commander in Chief who is clearly not worthy of his respect
Telling the truth regardless of the fact you know a bunch of corrupt media will lie and twist everything you say is a respectful and commendable act.
This issue should be settled now. 
Okay then.
Unless he did it on 5th Ave.
Mike, shut up.
Yeah, no. Darrell is wrong. There's no reconciling the deliberate and repeated refusal to condemn the white nationalists, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, etc., from this weekend with that assertion in any way consistent with objective reality.
Ah!  So you know big words, and yet can't accept that someone may have a differing opinion on what "news" should be responsible for.  Just because media has a defined role today doesn't mean that is the role I believe media SHOULD have.

Yet again, you denigrated yourself by attacking your "opponent" directly.  You don't even know me, and you feel the need to strike at my intellect, rather than at the topic of discussion.

Take a breather, read what I wrote twice so you don't miss anything this time, and try to be civil.  Being an ass just makes you look pathetic and desperate.
No matter what Trump said they were going to shit on him for it.  He was honest and that's more than most presidents would have done.
You are delusional.
He made an entire speech condemning all of them and you just ignore it.  There is no making you children happy.  At least have the common decency to keep your bullshit off of subs that you don't belong on.

Head back over to trumpnicknames with the rest of the useful idiots.  I'm sure everyone is waiting anxiously for your next witty and hateful comment about our elected president.
You are a child who is being used as a useful idiot.
Not even a Republican. I'm an independent pushed to the right by the repulsive propaganda I see by insane leftist. Didn't even read your post. Just the first line. 
I'm not a conservative... are you assuming my political affiliation? 
He's right though
You've accomplished nothing in lots of text.  Your opinion on role of media is incorrect, if you enjoy the freedoms of democracy that is. 
"Didn't even read" yea that's for sure your motto in general.  "Insane leftist" is hilarious.  After your buddy Donald, we really are going to have to make America great again, assuming there is anything left to repair. 
Well you're a dumbass, so yes.  The dumbasses tend to apologize for the pathetic ineptitude of our modern Republican Party. 
Yes, because murder is wrong. 
unfortunately for America, the left controls (totally) the national discourse
My opinion is incorrect?  Because you know what the role of media should be?  And there is no room for that role to change?

We aren't talking about truth (though you seem to think we are).  This is an opinion!  The role of media is not set in stone.  The definition of what media should and shouldn't do is not a universal truth or law.  These are opinions, they are mutable, and they have already changed over time, and will again.

Learn the separation of opinion from fact, because it appears you have muddied that line and can't distinguish (or refuse to) between the two right now.

My opinion of the role of media is not about what it is, but what I believe it should be (as I stated before).  I wouldn't be announcing my opinion if I believed media was already handling this the way it should.  I believe the media should be held to a higher standard of honesty and truth, more rigorous fact checking before they make announcements, and to take responsibility when their statements are false and damaging to others.  That's an opinion, and that's a role they could have.

Learn to separate fact from opinion.  It will help you argue more logically in the future.  A better angle for you would have been to state why YOU believe media shouldn't be held to a higher standard.

Try again.
Again, patently incorrect.  I appreciate the advice from someone clearly spending lots of time crafting an argument online, but the reality is the role of media doesn't require definition.  It up to you to think critically, have a comprehensive understand of history and current events and then take different sources of media to produce an accurate perception of reality.  Blaming media is just a reflection on your own inability to form a rational and accurate perspective of the world.  Those that lament the media to no avail are only exposing their own ignorance, as if the media was somehow responsible for the integrity of your worldview.  Perhaps you would go well to not blame others, but blame yourself for your own lack of effort. 

Be an adult.
After his SOTU speech, he got nearly a solid week of positive coverage simply because he spoke in sweeping generalizations and complete sentences without ad-libbing some incoherent word salad. 

Fast forward to this weekend and he refused to name the worst people at the rally and tried to focus solely on the clashes and used the "it takes two to tango" defense.  Who's responsible for initiating the violence this weekend was far less important to the conversation than condemning the Klansmen and neo-Nazis that showed up.  They showed up openly hoping to provoke conflict, as they confirmed with their words in interviews,their provocative chants,  shields and clubs, battle rattle and AR's.  

There's also the fact that everyone there to protect the statue was on some level an extremist white supremacist.  Not every counter protestor was antifa.  
I didn't apologize for shit 😂
&gt;After his SOTU speech, he got nearly a solid week of positive coverage 

I just googled his address just because I thought I may be wrong.  Nope, article after article of how Trump is a liar, "Watch Colbert shred Trumps speech" ,  "Trump gave a nod to the progress since the Civil Rights movement but he's a racist because...".

So you're totally full of shit with that statement.

&gt;he refused to name the worst people at the rally

The worst people at that rally were the ones committing violence, like ANTIFA and the white supremacist.  He said both sides were bad, he also gave an entire speech about condemning racism. 

&gt;There's also the fact that everyone there to protect the statue was on some level an extremist white supremacist.

You don't know that.  Just because someone doesn't want our history to be removed doesn't mean they are a racist.  I was once granted access into a room where Robert E. Lee and his generals strategized during the Civil War and I was allowed to sit in his chair.  That is a piece of history and it should be preserved. Does liking history make me a racist?  Does wanting to preserve that history make me a racist?

 I would say a lot of Americans don't see things as black versus white and racism doesn't enter their minds every minute of every day.





Colbert ripping Trump is not "the media". You can't conflate them with the reporting media. Even his harshest critics at CNN/MSNBC would gush about how Presidential he sounded. 

No person is advocating to remove any battle markers.  No one wants to erase history.  They just think these statues, erected on public land to honor men who supported slavery, by people that wanted to validate the war during the Jim Crow era, send the wrong message.  Put up a monument to the war if you want.  Just don't make it one that honors people that wanted to keep slavery.  The Daughters of the Confederacy had a big influence on the erection of most of the monuments, even up here in free states, and they were meant as a thumb in the eye to the black people that wanted equal rights just as much as they were meant to honor Confederate generals.
Awesome.  You tell me I'm wrong, but three times you have failed to explain HOW I'm wrong.   I never blamed the media for the integrity of my world view.  I blamed them for the lack of integrity of theirs.  Again, your assumptions insert your foot into your own mouth.

Please actually READ what I post, instead of browsing over it, then covering it in a layer of your own assumptions.
The first story I saw was from CNN shitting all over Trumps speech and Trump.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/02/28/politics/donald-trump-congress-speech/index.html

So again, you're full of it.

Where does it stop then?  When do we remove any mention of Robert Byrd?  A Democrat that was at the highest level in the KIK.

What about the Democratic Party itself?  A political party built on racism and hate for black people.

How about Planned Parenthood?  An organization founded with the idea of controlling black populations through eugenics.

How about Malcom X, do his statues go to?  

How about native Indians who were slave owners?  Do we start wiping out their history too?

How about the black slave owners, do we start writing this out of the history books too?

I can point out so many examples of this hypocritical bullshit it would take me days to write it all out.  
Yea bro only problem is WE NEED TO FIGHT FACISM WITH VIOLENCE.  NAZIs must die.  Too many Americans died fighting them to see a resurgence.  VIOLENCE AGAINST NAZIs. 
How was Byrd's record after he renounced the clan? (For the record, I hate having his name all over everything because that was straight up, "look at all the federal dollars I'm spending here" populist vote buying.) 

What is the Democrats record on race since the Civil Rights era? Better than ours, arguably. 

What has Planned Parenthood done lately that has a racist motive? 

How is the civil rights movement on par with slavery?

What enshrined native Americans had slaves, and what is the context of those monuments? 

How many black people in America owned slaves?  Do we have any monuments to them?

Nobody wants to erase history.  We still have books, should you care to ever try some.  We can still have markers at battlefields at monuments to the union.  We can still have have memorials at significant locations.  What we shouldn't have, if we're going to be honest with ourselves about our past, is statues to people who fought the United States for the sake of owning other people. 

All of your examples of hypocrisy fail Phil 101 logic tests. Full of false equivalence and straw men.

So I baited you with that and of course you responded with the same idiotic talking points provided to you by other idiots.

If renouncing your racism and not committing racist atrocities for a certain amount of time qualifies you to be left alone by the hordes of morons wanting to erase our history, then explain why you all don't carry the same opinion in regards to Robert E. Lee who renounced slavery numerous times?

"**I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interests of the South. So fully am I satisfied of this, as regards Virginia especially, that I would cheerfully have lost all I have lost by the war, and have suffered all I have suffered, to have this object attained.**"

Have fun explaining that one away.  Oh, and you probably would have known this about Robert E. Lee had you picked up a book.
I've read plenty about it. A few quotes don't absolve a person of literally killing people to preserve a horrible practice.  He also didn't have a body of work decades long after the war doing work to repair the damage of slavery.

If he founded a school, especially one for freed slaves, by all means put a statue out front.  It still doesn't mean he rates one in combat uniform in a town square, or his name on other schools, streets, or buildings, unless a legit connection can be traced.

I didn't use talking points, but you did. I simply used logical arguments to prove them invalid.
&gt;He also didn't have a body of work decades long after the war doing work to repair the damage of slavery.

Lee died within 5 years of the Civil War ending so how the hell is he going to have decades of good deeds?  Wtf

Lee became president of a college and turned it into a prestigious University after the war.  He gave the university it's largest endowment and black people were allowed to go there.  There is a statue, and the band of idiots want all resemblance of Lee taken down and the school to remove his name.

Again, happy to educate you about these things but it doesn't seem like you are learning anything.  
I'm fine with him having a statue there. It isn't one I think should come down.  But the Confederate General statues aren't monuments to his benevolence or support for scholarship.  I can separate the two. 
Drivel 
no one on the left will ever see/hear any of this

but if some accidentally do, it will all be dismissed as lies
Well what did he expect going on CNN? You cant actually be mad about this
But shouldn't the issue be racism RIGHT NOW, rather than trying to justify it by referring to history?  We will never get anywhere if the attitude is "they did it too!"
I know there are true racists out there, but I don't know any.  further, I don't know anyone who knows any.  it seems to me charges of racism are almost all political
[removed]
You've never, ever known anybody who was racist? I find that very hard to believe. 
I didn't say that.  I said **NOW**
Is this supposed to be a reminder of how dumb the people at Slate.com are?
It's so inspiring to see Sean Hannity care so much about racism! 
I live in Texas. Believe me, buddy. There are casual racists aplenty. Most just don't protest.
Yeah.  That's not happening yet.  They will go after the staffers they consider to be apostates though.  McMaster will still get dragged.  So will Kushner.  It will all be framed as those guys holding back Trump.  

Now, Trump is capable of pissing them off enough to turn on him, but I doubt it.  Trump is still Brannon's prince who was promised, and his greatest accomplishment so far.  This is also an administration that's very comfortable with unpaid advisor relationships.  I suspect Bannon will continue to play a role in White House strategy and will run stories closely aligned and timed with Trump's agenda.
&gt;Trump is still Brannon's prince who was promised, and his greatest accomplishment so far. 

Bannon didn't join the Trump team until after Trump was elected president, so what the hell are you talking about?
He didn't join the team until August but Breitbart.com was the conductor on the Trump Train early on.  So much so that a few editors quit in protest of the bias.  
So what, Bannon isnt responsible for Trump being elected.
Presidents aren't responsible for the stock market doing well. Doesn't stop them from believing it was their leadership that make it possible.
Huh
I was trying to draw an analogy that shows peoples opinions of their effect on things does not necessarily reflect the reality.  Or Bannon's opinion of himself may be greater than your opinion of him.
Not Trump but the RINOs, hold overs and leakers. 
The DoD/military does believe in climate change and that it will drive an increasing number of conflicts over resources and refugees.
Not, it does not.  It was told to prepare to it by Obama. That's it.
Republican led congress requested a report on it.

https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/612710/
I wonder what reasoning each one of these people have for denouncing Trump.

I'm not that concerned that they say it, I want to know why they say it.
It's because of him condemning ANTIFA and White supremacists in Charlottesville
What are they expecting him to say? I would think this condemnation would be a good thing?
It was because of him drawing a false equivalency between the two groups.  The ones marching with torches and rifles, shouting racist chants, and advocating ethno-states are objectively morally worse than hippies with sticks.  A supremacist committed murder over the weekend.   

Being *technically* correct that both sides engaged in violence is worthless.  It is worthless because it removes all context from the weekend and from the groups involved.  "Both sides" is a matter for the legal system.  The protests and any responses to them are political in nature, and the political response is important.  

Also, the "deep state" is a myth.

ANTIFA is a violent domestic terrorist organization that have members currently facing multiple felonies from attempted murder to assault with a deadly weapon.

These pieces of shit went to that rally to assault people and that is exactly what they did.  Protesting for something even as vile as white supremacy does not allow anyone to be violent just because they have tiki torches, legal firearms, and a horrible message.

What Trump said was exactly right and only a complete partisan and/or a dipshit would think otherwise.  

And ANTIFA isn't "hippies with sticks", they're violent communists.  Read their own announcements and tweets, they are a domestic terrorist organization made up of extremely far left zealots trying to start a revolution.


why do I feel we're losing (we = sensible/logical people) when we even respond/explain how wack job leftists are loonie tunes?
Only complete partisans like most every other elected Republican in the country would think otherwise.  Take off the orange colored glasses. I'm not fond of an appeal to the crowd but at some point you have to look around at the overwhelming disparity in numbers on this and wonder, "maybe I'm wrong". 

I've voted republican for 20 years, and only once did I vote for anything other than (R).  Trump was the only republican on the ballot I didn't vote for last year.  I'm not partisan, and certainly not an idiot.  Antifa is still not classified as a domestic terror organization, despite their spurts of violence.  

You seemingly missed my point.  Everybody except "Trump can do no wrong" republicans heard the same message, even from opposite sides of the spectrum.  
&gt;I'm not fond of an appeal to the crowd but at some point you have to look around at the overwhelming disparity in numbers on this and wonder, "maybe I'm wrong".

I don't subscribe to group think so no, I'm not wondering if I should change my opinion because others are ignoring facts.

Politicians are spineless, if speaking out against their president will make them look good to their voters they'll do it regardless if it genuine or not.
How does that explain the retired and last term politicians condemning him?  There's nothing to be gained.  If you ignore the political realities of the whole situation, you are, by definition, ignoring facts of the matter. 
How are they simultaneously deep state and elected public officials? Does "Deep State" mean anything?

Why do Christians use the Old Testament as a lesson on Christianity? It seems to me they pick and choose which lessons and laws they will follow. "Have a border" good, "don't eat shrimp" bad. 

As for Babel, look at line 6:

"And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them."

So the problem is that one world is too powerful. 

Anyway, if you want a biblical quote that is relevant:

"Do not put a barrier to the stranger for you were once strangers in the land of Egypt."


It's current year, you don't get to condemn the Left without RINOS attacking you.
&gt;Morally worse  

I forgot that it was illegal to be mean. Freedom of Speech isn't there to simply protect popular speech, otherwise it'd be basically useless. The Nazis **legally** acquired permit and stated their location of the March. The leftists assembled illegally with weapons and started antagonizing police and Nazis because their feelings were hurt. Even CNN reporters were attacked by the "peaceful counter protestors" and that should be proof of their non-existent moral superiority.  

They're not "anti-hate activists", they're simply violent self-righteous anarchists, many of them hating "evil white males who are the cause of all the world's woes".
The counter protestors did in fact have a permit as well.  Protesting nazis and klansmen will always be the morally superior side, even when a few dipshits in the crowd get carried away.  

The extremists made up a very small amount of the left's protestors.  The right was made entirely of people ok with standing shoulder to shoulder with the klan and nazis.  

The statement was never just about the violence.  The problem was never just about the violence.   
Cult
&gt;Points of view I seem incorrect should be banned  

That's not for you to decide. How would you feel if when evangelism was basically the mainstream and deemed gay marriage or atheism "offensive speech to God" and shut down the rallies?  

The nazis were not many when compared to the counter rioters. The ANTIFA I would bet have been more. It's not their first rodeo either. When Milo, Chapiro, and other conservative speakers went to Berkeley to protest ANTIFA has gathered in large groups and burned signs mentioning free speech and assaulted people. They destroyed public property, shops, and banks. They burned American flags and they called for the death of white people and police.  

How they hold moral superiority just because they hate a different group from the one that is traditionally known to be hated simply due to race is nonsense.
I never advocated for a point of view to be banned.  Where's that coming from?

Additionally, for the most part I'm holding my arguments to the specific Charlottesville protests specific to Charlottesville.  I'm not a fan of antifa, but it's still a small group, even if motivated.  Most of the counter-protestors in attendance had no affiliation with antifa, and probably know little about them other than the Berkeley incident.  Most of the "conservative" protestors self identified with the alt-right and it's varying degrees of racism.  That's the big separator for me.
Or maybe the ones who aren't actively courting a racist base?
Nope. Paper ballots
No, it doesn't
So basically the new neo-con. A term that had a specific meaning that now means those I don't like.

&gt;I'm not a fan of antifa, but it's still a small group  

You think Nazis are a huge group that run the country or something? The ANTIFAs were as many or more than the Nazis.  

&gt;It was because of him drawing a false equivalency between the two groups. The ones marching with torches and rifles, shouting racist chants, and advocating ethno-states are objectively morally worse than hippies with sticks.  

Here you call ANTIFA "hippies with sticks", even though they're [**just as bad as the Nazis**](https://sisypheannewscom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/antifagreece.png). It isn't false equivalency when that group causes riots and destroys public property while publicly calling for the murder of whites and cops (and even acted on some of these threats). One side thinks whites are superior and the other thinks whites should be killed. That isn't a false equivalency, it's the extreme of both political spectrum but the only difference is that the ANTIFA never gets any blame and is called "peaceful anti-hate protestors" by both Democrats and MSM, CNN literally called them "spreading peace through violence" . That is the "big separator for me".
When did antifa murder cops?  I don't think antifa's default setting is peaceful, it seems they show up everywhere spoiling for a fight, but so did the nazis and klansmen. 

Another difference is that the lefties support an economic model that they think hasn't been tried.  You know and I know they're wrong, but they are sincere in wanting to try it again "the right way". The antifa does not believe that whites should be killed, especially since so many are white. 

The alt-right has no naivety about what it wants. It's most evil goals don't even have anything to do with the economy. 

Listen, all I really want is for my party to put down the mindset that it should be against anything and everything on the left just because they're the left.  There is never a reason to excuse nazis or the klan.  There is no justification. There is never a good reason to give them hope that someone is listening.  That's all I want.  If we can identify antifa that were trading blows, by all means charge them with assault.  I don't like their message or their methods. I hope the filthy socialists never get a meaningful representation in Congress.  

They are still not as bad as the alt-right.  Maybe it's because they support the most extreme republican candidates, and are pulling the party further right than it should be. I mean, they've helped pull us so far right that lefty policies like tariffs and protectionism are suddenly our policies?  Propping up bad businesses with fed dollars? It's crazy to me. They've done all that, and they're still racists to boot. 

Antifa was a very small subsection of the counter protestors. Lots of people from all walks of life think the statues that were erected specifically to lionize the south, rewrite history, and intimidate black citizens shouldn't continue to do so. 

Every single person in that torch march was a white supremacist.  Every single one.  There is no escaping that. The entire rally was put together by them for them.  They have an extremely objectionable message.  Businesses closed to deny them access to their goods.  Regular citizens came out to tell them they objected to them being in their town.  Its a college town, which by nature means alot of college kids who love a protest. 

This is why and how the alt-right was worse than the leftist protestors.  The message, makeup, and death toll of each side last weekend is far more damning for the alt-right.  Then Trump played the false equivalency, which they interpreted (correctly) as a wink to them and their cause.  The very fact that they got that message should be enough for even Trump's most ardent supporters to say, "yeah, he fucked up on that one".  Instead, they double down like he did.  It sends a terrible message and makes us all look bad because that's our guy, wether we like it or not, and he legitimized nazis.  


my compliments.  99% of the time he's wack job far left
I don't know what to think about them having to remind themselves not to be violent. 
So, Tucker Carlson believes the Allies in WWII are equally to blame for the violence of the war? "Sure the Nazis were violent, but so were the Allies!"
Well if you kill women and children or go around raping, you're no saint
Violence from the left radicalizes people on the right which radicalizes more people on the left which in turn radicalizes people on the right.

After watching the speech in its entirety, I have to agree with Don.  That was a dumpster fire of nonsense, blame shifting, and jingoism. 
&gt; Who cares

who cares...about Rock or Kaepernick?
Just assuming you are talking about the Rock running for president, I hope he doesn't but other than that I don't care about either one
Rock isn't running for president....he's **maybe** running for Michigan Senator
Kid Rock and *The* Rock are two different people.
Yeah when you called him Rock I made a mistake as I said I was assuming the Rock not Kid Rock 
I am aware of that I made a mistake as when I read Rock with capitalization I automatically think of the Rock. 
I think that was a look of embarrassment for Trump and himself by association 
That doesn't make her a hypocrite. She's not her father...
Liberals like to say Trumps father went to a KKK rally. Does same logic apply there? 
Yes. It's called 'guilt by association' and is a branch of the [ad hominem logical fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/10/Ad-Hominem-Guilt-by-Association). 
Pelosi is a hypocrite, maybe not for this but she is definitely a hypocrite.
I believe she is, but that wasn't the point I felt compelled to make.
Is dedicating a statue the same thing as being a member of a terrorist organization? 
Are you referring to the Democratic Fraternity aka the KKK? 
Do you like that liberals say that? Do you agree with them? Or do you think it's a stupid fucking point that is utterly meaningless because Trump is a separate person from his father?

Don't do to others what you don't like done to yourself. This is a weak argument. 
“The son will not bear the punishment for the father’s iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son’s iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself” (Ez 18:20)
Regardless of how true it is, I think his point is that this is Bannon's own belief and view.

Teaching our kids about another culture and another language is an amazing idea to help us understand a group of people we obviously do not have a grasp on. 
 
If we know their culture and their language we will be less likely to want to have negative engagements with them. 

I say the US federal government should be sponsoring more language classes (Chinese, Arabic, Russian, etc) across the US. 

Edit: additional thought, the French and English fought for centuries until the early 20th century. Why did they stop? Because their was a movement to understand one another's culture on both sides of the channel. 
Because they found a common enemy.
No the movement for the FR and ENGB alliance was happening way before WW1. Did it help solidify? Yes,  no doubt. but everything was in the works before then :). It wasn't like WW1 is what made them put their differences aside

If you attack North Korea, you'll prove their point that the only way to protect themselves is through nuclear weapons.

Attacking Gaddafi in Libya after assuring him he wouldn't be attacked after stopping his nuclear program was bad enough. 

Doing the same to North Korea would ensure every country in the planet would start a nuclear program.

Yes. Because everyone would lose. So by extension NK loses. 
America has numerous anti-missle defense systems throughout the world and for much more sophisticated missiles than what that dickhead could launch at us.

Nothing would even come close to us.
Yes, and/or duh. 
I just... can't fathom the point of saying this. 
Me either. North Korea isn't a power even worth considering in terms of  their capability to actually win a war. That's never been the issue at all.

The issue has always been what are the consequences of steamrolling them that aren't their infinitesimally slim chances of winning. 

Namely, the damage and casualties they could inflict day one to Seol/South Korea, a probable proxy war with China that could potentially escalate to open and possibly nuclear war, and that no one wants to be left holding the humanitarian shit pile North Korea will be after they're steamrolled. 

All their nuclear capabilities really changes is that they can now potentially inflict two million casualties day one instead of tens of thousands and that it makes it harder for newer technologies or precision operations to disable their ability to inflict damage before there are unpalatable numbers of casualties.
I can't wait to see the full interview. This going to be nuts.

What's the point of this being posted here?
I don't think it's fair to say that more men are falsely accused of rape  than women are raped by perps who get away. [Here](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf) are the stats I found. 63% of rapes are thought to go unreported to the police, and false or baseless reports are thought to be between 2-10% of reported rapes.

The fact that a lot of women are actually raped does not need to discredit the fact that it is problematic men go to jail after being falsely or baselessly accused. 

Which is not to say that the 1 in 4 or 5 statistics are real, just that even though those numbers are inflated, it is still also a problem. If we go with the 2.1/1000 number, that's still 339,255 women in the United States who were/will be raped, 213,731 of which went unreported. If you live in a decently sized city it would be fairly reasonable even by this number for there to be protests by hundreds or thousands of people who were actually raped. It'd be about 8,700 women in NYC by that number, and ~21,210 in the greater metro area. 

And, anywhere from 4,275 to 21,373 men falsely accused across the entire country. Which is all just to say, it's no wonder that you can find tons of articles about women falsely accusing men, but that doesn't mean it's more frequent than actual rapes. 

When people on the other side hear your argument, they hear you saying that you support these changes because you don't believe that women are actually being raped in general. And they tone out before ever hearing the logical part of the argument. If you want to persuade, you need to accept the premises of their problems, because they are real, then get them to accept the premises of your problems, because they are real, and then debate the solutions. 

As an aside, the supreme court ruled in 1977, Coker v. Georgia, that the death penalty could not be given to rapists. Nobody is dying because of false rape accusations by state governments (maybe by personal vendettas though). In 2008 they expanded the ruling to include preventing the death penalty for child rapists, for similar reasons. 

I think you made some really good points, but your presentation could use some touching up. 

You say you don't know what shaming they're talking about. Fastforward to 10:18, where you say, "let's just use our brain here, okay, look at this woman." and then cut to Family Guy throwing up for almost half a minute. 

I think that's exactly what they're talking about. In this particular case the woman really did falsely accuse people, and it was problematic. But it wasn't the fact she was hefty that made her guilty. But, when girls report rapes, and aren't the image of beauty, they will face this kind of shaming in retaliation regardless of whether or not they were actually raped. If not by the rapist, then by his friends, who don't think he'd do such a thing.

And this is the heart of the problem. In these kinds of cases, either the guy will be found guilty of rape, or the girl will be found guilty of false reporting. The system is setup to prevent any kind of resolution that doesn't punish one side or the other, and it's only natural that guys should want it to be in their favor, and girls should want it to be in theirs. So long as this is true, we'll keep fighting. 

I think a lot of the problem stems from sex education in this country, or rather, the lack thereof. This is part of why there is 'baseless reporting' - which is when the girl genuinely believes she was raped, and the guy genuinely believes he didn't rape her. In these cases, it's possible nobody is in the wrong, but the girl thinks the guy did something bad, and the guy thinks himself falsely accused. And they're not going to talk to each other and figure out what really happened, because the guy's instinct will be to deny it lest his life be ruined, which is fair enough. And the girl's instinct will generally either be to report him, as a moral imperative to prevent harm to others, or to not report him, because they still don't really understand what happened to them, or are afraid of being shamed.

Because if they do accuse him, sometimes he'll deny they ever had sex, saying "let's just use our brain here, okay, look at this woman," or they'll admit they had sex but argue it wasn't rape, and using similar logic say, "let's just use our brain here, okay, does it really make sense that I'd have to rape her? She puts out for everyone, she's a total slut." And this is what they mean by shaming. And it is genuinely problematic, because it leads to real rapes not being reported.

It's a real problem that people don't know how to talk about these things without needing to deny the reality of other perspectives. The whole issue boils down to [specificity versus sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity). One side wants to minimize false positives (false accusations), whereas the other wants to minimize false negatives (letting the guilty go free). Both are understandable motivations, and are not irrational. And, clearly, both sides are guilty of sharing inaccurate statistics.
**Sensitivity and specificity**

Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test, also known in statistics as classification function:

Sensitivity (also called the true positive rate, the recall, or probability of detection in some fields) measures the proportion of positives that are correctly identified as such (e.g. the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition).

Specificity (also called the true negative rate) measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as such (e.g. the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition).

While I understand your position, I feel like you're making a lot of assumptions about how people will perceive discussions about Title IX. I agree that in general, at the macro level, attacking Title IX gets presented as arguing that an unrealistic amount of men are falsely accused of rape. I don't participate in discussions at this level so I can't really offer much opinion on a better method.

At the personal level, on the few occasions that I've had discussions about Title IX with other students, I've found people pretty open to hearing criticisms of Title IX as long as they didn't ignore the acknowledged statistics. My issue with it is largely that I think it's ridiculous for a person to be able to be found innocent in a court of law but be kicked out of their college. To me that implies the college is simply assuming guilt based on a much lower bar of evidence. If there is insufficient evidence to convict a person of rape then I don't believe colleges should be allowed to punish the student as if they had committed rape. Further, I don't think college administrations should be dealing with this sort of problem to begin with. I think rape should be a matter for local police departments and no one else. And while I recognize colleges often have their own police officers who work closely with the college and its staff, I still think that it should be a matter separate from the proceedings of the college itself.
Because Trumps admin is doing it. 
Sounds like you are working off national numbers for the whole population. Wouldn't that be fairy meaningless when talking about just the college student population?
Apparently these days being a republican means that you need to spend 5 minutes a day hating CNN.

You can see how terrible the reporter was here.. He told a man to get back inside to safety because the storm was going to worsen. The reporter had talked to the man before and was concerned for his safety. What an absolute monster, we need smaller government to stop this. 
College rape isn’t significantly larger than national statistics. If anything it’s actually lower. It’s discussed in the video that the statistics based off surveys for college rape statistics is wrong due to non response bias. The national average for rape is 2.1 out of 1000. The false claims on college campuses is 1 out of 4 or 250 out of 1000. So college campuses experience rape 125 times the national average??? What college are these people going to? That alone should show these to be wrong as they would be incorporated into the national average bringing that up from 2.1 out of 1000
Yea. I think one of the reasons a lot of people are led to believe it's particularly bad in college is because they are able to see the disparity between high schools and college, but not yet that that disparity also exists outside of college. 

Idk whether or not it's actually higher or lower, but it's probably on the same order of magnitude regardless
&gt; The false claims on college campuses is 1 out of 4 or 250 out of 1000

The reason that number is so high is bc of how insanely broad they define sexual assault.  The authors of the study themselves said that Obama's characterization of the numbers were misleading.  They lump an unwanted sexual comment into the same category as actual physical rape.  When you define it that broadly, that's how they end up with a number that high.
I agree completely! I may have been a little sleep deprived and ranty last night. 

&gt;I agree that in general, at the macro level, attacking Title IX gets presented as arguing that an unrealistic amount of men are falsely accused of rape

I guess what I was trying to get at, was that if we argue that *they* are saying an unrealistic amount of women are actually being raped, we're giving them incentive to turn around and say that *we* are saying an unrealistic amount of men are falsely accused. And I pointed that out because it sounded like a similar logic might be underlying the ideas discussed in this video, in that, because the other side often acts like false accusations are not a real problem because their frequency is lower than what guy's think, he is saying rape is not as big of problem as they think because it's frequency is lower than what girl's think. I don't think he's consciously justifying it thus - but why should he believe any of their statistics if some of them are definitely wrong, and those of his that are right are considered by them to be ridiculous? And the same problem exists on the other side, which just causes both sides to reinforce their view that the other is lying intentionally for the purpose of narrative. Maybe I'm reading a bit too much between the lines here, but some fraction of both sides are guilty of this, and some fraction of both sides are also not guilty of this, and on both sides the frequency of the real problem is too high. 

&gt;At the personal level, on the few occasions that I've had discussions about Title IX with other students, I've found people pretty open to hearing criticisms of Title IX as long as they didn't ignore the acknowledged statistics.

My experience as well - but also in the reverse. They should acknowledge it's maybe not really 1 in 4, but I haven't seen anyone have a productive conversation with the other side that began with the claim that there are more false rape accusations than actual rapes! If we want them to abandon their incorrect statistics, the ones we use have to be right, and they shouldn't completely invalidate the problem experienced on the other side. The people who are protesting often are people who have experienced these things, or know people who have, and their experiences are completely valid and reveal a real problem. We can understand their argument is made from a rational perspective, just as the argument is this video is rational, even as they both use faulty statistics, because they are biased by their own experiences and see those statistics as being compatible with those experiences. Which is why we can't have meaningful conversations with them if they feel like we are invalidating or outright denying their own experiences ever happened, and vice-versa.

&gt;Further, I don't think college administrations should be dealing with this sort of problem to begin with. 

Absolutely agree with you here. I don't think the colleges appreciate having to take on this role!
They also have a lot of non response bias in their studies. Someone like myself who could have received a request to fill out a survey in relation to rape would have been likely to not respond to it. So with loose definitions of rape and inaccurate surveying and studying led to the outrageous numbers 
While Shapiro definitely enjoys mocking college kids and their world views, nothing he says on campus remotely resembles something that would require therapy.  I just don't understand.


Have you watched people who protest his speeches?
Not much.  I mean, by all means, protest him if you think he's wrong.  But to be so damaged that you need a counselor is crazy.   
I agree, that is crazy. But the sad thing is, I don't think that is outside the realm of possibilities. Some of those people do look like they need serious help. 
I think most those people don't understand how many death threats and other hate mails he gets from "conservatives" because he's a jewsish never-Trumper.  His rhetoric doesn't come near that.
Honestly, that doesn't surprise me. I will admit, that thought hadn't come to me. Though, he definitely doesn't allude to it or mention it in his podcasts. 
Liberalism is a mental disease.
Bullshit! Just because none of Al Gore's predictions where wrong doesn't mean he wasn't right! /s 
The letter is not disputing climate change. The letter is disputing the severity of the effect humans are having on it. 
Nobody is denying that Climate Change exists, because it clearly does.

The debatable thing is if it's _man-made_ or not. That's what's still up in the air here.
This article is from 5 years ago. The 49 former NASA employees include 23 administrators, 8 astraunauts, 7 engineers,  5 techs, 4 scientists or math 
Mathematicians based on their job titles. Though all smart, none were/are climate scientists.

It doesn't take much effort to find climate scientists generally all agree, we have man made climate changes occurring.  Says a lot that all the deniers have is a letter written over five years ago with no data but just a complaint about how NASA is addressing climate change.
oh yeah. Graham, what a stalwart. lOL
AKA disputing climate change...

Let's not nitpick semantics. When some politician or liberal activist talks about climate change, and demands that the US halt all emissions while the rest of the world does little to nothing, they're talking about anthropogenic climate change, man-made climate change.
That's not still up in the air and has not been for decades.  What's up in the air is accurate we can predict and prevent future warming.  The prediction graph has a max and min extreme curve that has proven true.  
Predictable as the tides. He must have a primary approaching. It's the only time RINO graham talks tough.
Somehow I feel like this is a joke. 

I mean it is a good joke, but I don't believe this is real. 
Is this the extent of these kids argument now? Everyone who disagrees with them is a nazi. 
I honestly don't think so. the GOP will win the midterms. I'm just commenting so I can say "I told you so" or "guess I was wrong".. haha.

Keep it coming.  Antifa and their ilk are destroying any reputation the Democrats had left.  The quickest way to lose an argument is to overstate your case.  And the more the Democrats try to make the case that Trump and Republicans are fascist, Nazi, white supremacists, the faster they will lose, because no rational person is going to believe that when presented with actual facts.
Neck
I’m pretty sure that guy was confused about what he teaches. And I’m pretty sure he’s confused about everything else in his life. What a blatant idiot. 
that dude owned tucker
LOOK AT ITS NECK
Antifa is not a democratic group. They are an anarchist/anarchocommunist cabal, much further left than democrats. 
Don't let your children go to John Jay College. Sounds like a breeding ground for people who teach students never to take responsibility for themselves and that it's ok to move home and live with your parents for the rest of your life.


Every last one of them looks like they're made of glass. 
Okay, a few things here. 

First, the idea isn't to hurt Starbucks' bottom line. It's to hurt the revenue generated by the store locations at Trump-owned properties. Perhaps a misguided, quixotic attempt to influence policy but hardly ridiculous considering there are 2 Starbucks less than half a mile away from the Trump Tower one. 

Second, Carson has been asleep if he thinks progressives aren't putting pressure on companies to pay better. Let alone equal pay policies that have been pushed, places like Apple and Starbucks actually *do* pay their employees well. Starbucks in particular provided healthcare, 401(k), and a high wage for what is low-skilled labor baristas. 


Tucker Carlson is so cute. Love his charm
CANT CUCK THE TUCK! \#BADEDGODTUCKER
Of course he did.  His mind was already made up.

All you got is a five year old letter written by retired people from NASA...none of which were climate scientists and no data provided to support their uneducated opinion on the matter? Please.
He acts and speaks like uneducated trash. He doesn't know what class is.
The signatories to this letter are not disputing climate change. They're questioning the science indicating that CO2 is the primary factor behind observed climate changes. 
black trump supporters are stupid

most blacks live in poverty, Trump wants to cut welfare and social services to lower taxes for the rich

he called the Central Park Five guilty and demanded their executions, had a history of being racially discriminatory in his apartments and wants to expand *'stop and frisk'* in urban areas even though broken window policing has been proven to not work and isn't viable in preventing crimes
"most blacks live in poverty" - Look, the racist showed up
Can't support illegal immigrants and say youre looking after the best interests of disenfranchised us citizens . 

Re racially discrimination  in his apts, any proof in that? Or is being sued enough? Did d. Trump himself prevent people from moving in? We're there 0 black people in any of his building? Was he found guilty? Oh ? That's been under reported, no Info available? Not like the us does a legally mandated census every 4 years. 

If I went through your post history and found you made the wrong call on something, would that invalidate you in your entirety? 

Edit: imagine /r/politics commenters being compared against /r/hatecrimehoaxes 
so what? it's like only rooting for people from your home state, or any other cultural association. sure it's not based on talent but it's the Emmy's. how is this noteworthy.
Right? Wtf. And regardless of a person's skin, shouldn't the goal be to get people *out* of poverty with employment, rather than keeping them in it with more welfare checks?
Black people are underrepresented in Hollywood, and even more so in Hollywood awards.  When their representation resembles their population share, we can criticize her.  
What she says is unfortunate, but posting this video on /r/republicans is far more unfortunate.

You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.
Does she root for Asians too?
But without the UN who's going to dish out stern sanctions to North Korea!? 

/s
I love it when these idiots turn on each other.
I think if we want changes in policy, we need to have Donald say things like, "I love abortion. I've had the most abortions. The number of abortions that I've paid for is hyuuuge!"

Then all of the idiots on the left will line up to vote to ban abortion because they are more anti-Trump than they are any pro-left policy
I doubt it, this looks more like she's shaking just because she's 400 years old.
Ya, it looks more like shakes due to bones turning to powder because skeletor has osteoporosis. 
Nobody liked her because she was a horrible human being. She could have been any gender or race. Still horrible. 

Contrast with Obama. I hated his policies, but he was a genuinely charasmatic leader. That's why he won both times. 
Yeah, the song is terrible, but even if it were good, Top Gun is a little old for a pop culture reference.  I mean, it came out almost a decade before a lot of the millennials were even born.
As I always say to these whack jobs: you first. 
Wow. That's much worse than I was expecting.
That's not gasping; it's laughing.
Paired with clapping
Slight polite clapping...after laughter which was at least as loud.

But it is billed here as "gasping". Can we at least agree there was no gasping?
That has to the worst campaign ad I've ever seen. What was he thinking? If I was voting in his district I'd look at that and tell myself "clearly this man has no sense of good judgement" and never vote for him. 
I was totally in agreement there was no gasping. I was saying in addition to laughter the clapping was even more evidence there is no gasping. We're on the same page, my dude.
Thank you. 
The look on President Trump's face when they laughed... he knows, I know. The UN is laughing it off.
[deleted]
Really? So by "trump" he meant "manafort" and by "Obama" he meant "9 judge paneled FISA court".
[removed]
No, they weren't and no he won't.  Trump was not surveilled, the people who were subject to surveillance had been the subject of warranted investigations, and a court approved the taps requested by the FBI.  Obama did not order them. 

There is no logical way to get from legal wire taps of Manafort to what you claim. 
The wiretaps were in place before Manafort joined the campaign and before the campaign started... Clearly vindication of the theory that the Trump campaign was being spied upon by Obama. 
Don't put this crap here. 
What?  How?  So, the FBI gets legal warrants to surveil Manafort before he's linked to the Trump campaign and somehow that equals spying on Trump?  That does not make any sense. Clearly not vindicated.  Clearly, Trump lied.
See Comey is a genius wizard who can see the future... But only until the day before the 2017 election. So he knows that Hillary needs help to win..

Yeah this makes no sense. Manafort was doing shady shit in Ukraine before he was involved in the Trump campaign. That was likely the reason for the surveillance so people could walk the line of "the campaign wasn't under surveillance"

Is this Freddie Mitchell? Formally Eagles WR? 
Why does anyone care is what I don't understand?  It's a friggin song that somehow enforces a football team to be loyal to a country?  It makes no sense to even care about such piddly things.  This is not the military, they are not swearing allegiance to a country when playing football.  It's a game.  That's it.
It's about respect, really. You either get it or ya don't. Obviously, this is another topic that will be added to the "Something America can't meet in the middle on" list... 

Me personally, think that kneeling for the flag is disrespectful because the song represents the heroes of our country. I also don't see how kneeling for the song is any kind of protest towards any oppression, etc... so that bothers me as well. But on the other hand, I'm not going to physically raise a big hoot about some who does take a knee.

Side note: I will say however... I think it's a little ridiculous to teach a kids, who have a developing/gullible mind, that taking a knee is the way to stand up against the evil in America. Especially when majority of us do actually see it as disrespect to the ones fighting for our country.
&gt;  I think it's a little ridiculous to teach a kids, who have a developing/gullible mind, that taking a knee is the way to stand up against the evil in America

That's my issue. An adult taking a knee is their issue and I may or may not agree with whatever statement they're trying to make but it's their prerogative. None of those kids understand what they're being told to do and why, they're being used as pawns.

I can agree with that.  And thank you for the response.  Guess I just don't understand why it is played at games.  What's the point?  This is a game, not a military drill or a gathering of patriots.  Guess that's where the most confusion comes from.  It's just a game.  I try and teach my kids things like that.  A time and a place for everything and nationalism at a football game is not the time nor the place.  They are going to watch people clobber the crap out of each other for money.  That has nothing to do with our national anthem.  That's what makes this so silly to me.  I do seriously appreciate the response though.  I wasn't thinking in terms of pride on our country when watching footballers beat the shit out of each other for money.
The left certainly uses multiculturalism to justify the racism/bigotry of lowered expectations.  ‘Oh, but that’s part of their culture, they don’t know any better!’
It appears the problem is not that her signs are pro-Trump, but that they are over 2 feet square, the legal limit in her town.

Some YouTube commenters are saying that she can fight that ordinance and win, but I'm not so sure.  The ordinance seems to be message-neutral.
&gt;The phrase “targeting sources of white privilege … does not mean exterminating people who are currently categorized as white” sound guilty.  It indicates that the idea of “exterminating people who are currently categorized as white” has been at least considered in his circles.  

I mean, if you're an "alt-right" personality, sure. They claim there is a white genocide taking place via "population replacement" because we let in immigrants. This kind of article has no place in this sub. You should repost to /T_D, where this kind of conspiracy crap belongs. 
How sad it is that we have a Republican President, Republican Government, Republican House, and Republican Senate, and yet the only content we ever get here is some fringe complaints about what the "Left" think or said.

The ball is in the Republican court now. It has been for over half a year now. Why is the persistent whining not stopping? Where's the action? Where are the results? Seriously how **weak** are Republicans to constantly present themselves as the victims even when they have majority in all institutions they care about?
Haven't we all seen both good and bad male and female leaders? It comes down to the individual. 
Wouldn't her argument be the same for say, a uneducated person being president, or a poor person.. or literally anyone-- because they have a unique perspective?

I hope that dumb bitch runs again, that's a guaranteed 8 years for Trump.

Then again, the Democratic Party is full of far left dingbats who have no appeal nationally so it's not looking good no matter what moron they prop up and fuck their voters out of a choice with.
Hillary is a deeply disturbed fruitcake

Not really sure where the lie was.  Could you be more specific? 
Everything that came out of her mouth was a lie
Nationalism at sports games is what happens when the Military starts marketing to children. 

while you're trying to let your kids watch a game of football The Pentagon is paying the NFL with your tax money to "brainwash" (tough word choice) your children to become more nationalist and to join up to the Army.

 


https://www.truthdig.com/articles/pentagon-paid-nfl-displays-patriotism/

I suppose 4 years of college was just to play football. Not like they have to acheive good grades to play or anything. I'm getting tired of this party and the idiots in it. Fuck Sessions. 
You mean the part where Trump ignored Puerto Rico for days and instead blasted football players? 
Actually if you didn't know he immediately made efforts to help and the Puerto Rican governor praised him for all he has done to help. The story saying Trump didn't pay attention is fake news. Just because the Clinton News Network didn't cover it doesn't mean it didn't happen 
Ooooh, my mistake. Would you like some more salt with your phake nooz? Clinton News network? What are you? A Russian? GTFOH with that dumb shit. Just cause CNN is liberal doesnt mean Clinton owns it. 

Ricardo Rosselló, the governor of Puerto Rico, was begging congress for more assistance, days ago. Just because the White House had initially unlocked funds for relief aid doesnt mean they will continue to do so in proportions needed to help recover the island. Go blow smoke up someone elses ass. 
Democrat appointed administration, Democrat-controlled states, Democrat deals with foreign governments and political parties, Leftist media, academia, entertainment ...
Aha. So until the moment every single state, institution and government employee is 100% Republican, we have an excuse to do nothing and whine and complain about Democrats. Got it.
Nothing like this is in the article.
I literally quoted it. Are you sure you know how to read?

I'm considering giving up on all Politics.  For years, I voted and waited.  Voted and waited.

Now it's almost a year and....nothing.  Both parties are contemptible.  No wonder the approval rating is in single digits.

Trump wants to change things.  He gets no help.  Republicans hate him and would rather have had Hillary -- then they could keep their cushy jobs by whining and lying.

I would vote for Trump in 2020.  But I won't vote for anyone else ever again and especially won't donate any more money to any politician ever again.
Couldn't have said it better myself. Without the swamp being drained, Trump can't move on things like he planned.
I hear you SpecOpsAlpha. These guys have become more than contemptible. I too am frustrated. 
An interesting take, but it seems more about protecting yourself from being called a bigot and not really proving that people are or aren't using it correctly.  It's an opinion piece, with no backing evidence, and is exactly what is wrong with our political conversations these days.  It's just like grade school drama.

We like to tell people what they are doing wrong, and how our way is right.  

We don't like to discuss how we could work together to do things better, or come up with any kind of cooperation and compromise (double sided, not one-sided compromise).

Let's not promote poor political discourse.  How can we work together with everyone to create a legitimate, and reasonable rule set for proper behavior?   Must we have a new Manual of Style for public discourse and cooperation?

The idea is to call people out on their issues in such a way that the person wants to change, not so they want to attack the accuser.  This is a thing called tact, which everyone has been lacking of late.

The difference is in the variation of group ideology. KKK wants to assert their dominance as the number one race (bc that makes sense). anti fascists want to stop another hitler, Mussolini, or Franco from coming to power.  I mean....we can al agree that isn't a bad thing right? Fascism is not American. 

Not saying I agree with their tactics but the differences are bigger than who controls who. 


They really wanna get rid of capitalism 
They really want to get rid of fascism, that I can say for certain. 
Not really if theyre the ones that are being fascists 
Here is the definition of fascism. A governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism. Please explain how they are being fascists. 
Sad that you're defending those terrorists
Who do you believe is being a fascist?  

I can call myself an anti-communist but if I'm going out and assaulting people who aren't communists then I'm really just a violent hateful piece of shit with a dishonest tagline.
Sad that you think defending the english language is defending terrorists, no wonder we can't get funding for education.
&gt;anti fascists want to stop another hitler, Mussolini, or Franco from coming to power.

So who are these fascists?  Where are all these people that they must fight and assault?

ANTIFA has shown up at political rallies that have absolutely nothing to do with fascism and committed assaults on innocent people.
To be honest I don't believe Antifa to be more than a bunch of organized idiots looking for a fight while pretending to believe in something so people will have their backs when they go to jail. 
Can you give some examples of when thy show up when fascists aren't around? Would love the input. 

Regarding who are the facists...I'd say the guys who show up with Nazi flags (that's the easy one :)), and anyone who willingly associates with folks like that. 
I don't understand your argument. Please elaborate. 
When the percnentages on which accuswtions are false or not, etc, are tossed around...i am left wondering( maybe I am missing something), but why should the percentage that are truthful or not dictate the process used to find the truth in these cases?
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/28/black-clad-antifa-attack-right-wing-demonstrators-in-berkeley/
I don't think that the numbers point to a particular solution, they just help interpret and understand the nature of the problem, which will be necessary to find the solution. 

The goal of the justice system should be to (1) punish wrongdoers, while (2) maintaining that each individual is considered innocent until proven guilty. The ability to prove guilt is critical to the ability of the justice department to function, and in rape cases in particular, it is extremely difficult to prove. 

In these cases it seems we can't 'have our cake and eat it too' - we can either (1) punish people accused of rape, and accept that we are at some rate punishing individuals who are falsely accused, or we can (2) let the majority of rapists go free, knowing that at least we didn't falsely punish anyone. 

It just isn't clear how we can do a good job of both punishing rapists and at the same time ensuring the presumption of innocence, when the nature of the crime is such that it is always subjective and difficult to prove. 

In the general populace (outside of universities) it's something like 1/3 of rapes are reported, and 2% of those reported lead to incarceration. So ~99.4% of rapists walk free. And this is the cost of protecting the presumption of innocence, given that rape is very difficult to prove. 

On various college campuses which have implemented their own methods for dealing with the issue that fall on the other end, and basically consider an accusation sufficient evidence to implement non-legal forms of punishment (eg, expulsion), it is something like 5% of the accused who are being falsely punished, and this is the cost of reducing the rate of unpunished rapes. 

Either way the system is screwing somebody over, and I don't know of any correct solution to the problem. But I know that the solution won't be found by coming up with false statistics (1 in 3 women are raped, or more men are falsely accused of rape than actually rape women) designed to invalidate the problem faced by the other side.
Do you have others? As I've noted above I don't agree with their tactics. Violence is for people who can't display a proper message (like Nazis or dictators or communists lol), but like I said they don't seem to show up unless the far right is involved. This was sponsored by a far right group before thy cancelled so I'd expect the antifa would show up. 13 were arrested too, which you would hope for
What do you consider far-right?  According to ANTIFA it's anyone who supports Trump or is a Conservative.  Is a gay conservative far-right to you?  How about people who organize a march against Marxism, are they far-right?  People who want lower taxes and believe in the constitution, are those the ideological beliefs of the far-right?

Let's establish what you believe is far-right rather than waste each other's time.  You have Google so you can look up the same things I can, why are you asking me to provide sources?
Wait, are you saying Antifa or the white supremacist neonazis are terrorists?
Ideological attributes I think are far right are fascism, corporatism, racism, holy law of any kind (Though I respect all religions and practice I believe the government and law should be made on secular grounds), or more broadly the opposition to universal background checks for buying guns (I don't care about owning guns or what kind you want to buy, I like guns, we just need background checks to stop lunatics). 

Those are some examples of what I believe is far right.  Idk what else far right can mean now a days it's just my input. 

I cannot speak for the antifa. They believe Trump is a fascist so anyone who supports him is too. As most conservatives voted for trump you could say they too were on that list. That's their beef, and I said I don't agree with their methods.

But what you noted above does not sound far right at all so that's confusing, as I too believe in the constitution, lower taxes for anyone making under 300k a year, and that all should have equal protection under the law. We're in the same boat here. 
&gt; I'm considering giving up on all Politics.

And do what?  All things depend on politics.  If you stop playing the game, all that will happen is you lose.  You abrogate your power to your enemies.

&gt; Trump wants to change things. He gets no help.

Trump can't get help because he has no charm, no connections, and doesn't know how to manipulate the levers of power in Washington.  This is why he was a terrible choice.  It's not enough to have good ideas, one must know how to be effectual.

&gt; Republicans hate him and would rather have had Hillary

Republicans do hate Trump, but once Trump won the nomination they changed their tune and started openly praising him, because they'd rather have him than Hillary.  "Better our bastard than their bitch" was their tacit mantra.
The system IS rigged and a lot more than Donald imagined.  It's like he's taking on the Roman Empire circa 200 AD.  The rot is too entrenched.
I don't think it's that.  The President is simply not a dictator.  Congress is not subordinate to the President.  Trump can't fire a Congressman.  When Trump promised to "drain the swamp", my response was "How the fuck are you going to do that?  It's not going to be as easy as switching on a pump."

Obama also suffered obstructionism.  The Republicans opposed pretty much everything Obama did.  He could "shove Obamacare down everyone's throats" only because the Democrats controlled Congress, but after the Congressional elections of 2010 he lost that advantage and the Republicans rendered him ineffectual.
The first paragraph of this story reads like it was written by a freshman who took political science as an elective.  It's frightening that someone would read this absolute bullshit and think it should be shared.  Shame on you OP.
Both really
Why do Trump supporters feel the need to lie so much?  This issue has nothing to do with the President.

He's posted it to 13 different subs. Obviously he is the author and thinks he just penned an award winning piece. However, it is really just a heaping pile of shit.

ANNIHILATES is a bit overzealous don't you think... She literally just regurgitated a talking points.... The investigation continues and they 100% are not releasing everything. Its hard to say 100% collusion off the table but it is not appearing so far to point to Trump directly
 
Not sure where the "slam" was. 
Looks like the "slam" was itself fake news.
Don't do this, Mr President. It is not in the USA's and your best interests. Ride out your anger and don't believe the media on the "moron" comment. they are trying to sow division. The more they can break up your cabinet, the stronger the opposition becomes.

It's okay to be ashamed of your president for golfing as his fellow Americans suffer. He's really not defensible. 
Liberals are fucking idiots.  Under Obama they were saying we needed to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, now it's evil.

fake news has been around for decades. 

why are people acting new?
Ya If you ever watched the Stephen Colbert, Scaramucci interview there was so much disrespect towards Scaramucci who had the balls to come on a show that he knew he would be witch hunted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esK9TkuEQc0
This kid needs to be in Leavenworth for the rest of his days. By abandoning his post he created a security hole in which his unit could have been devastated. Just for the risk he created, the lives that could have been lost, lock him up, forever.  
What? Talk about shitpost clickbait. And this is why our party has complete power yet cant accomplish anything. Its too busy stoking its ego to actually work.
Yeah, he had balls, but its not like he was sucking his own dick. *eyeroll* Scaramucci was thankfully the briefest embarrassment in this cabinet.  What a joke.
I agree 100% he risked the lives of his platoon and himself which it's ok to put your own life at risk but others is completely wrong.
Manafort is zero collusion? Why the fuck couldnt the party just have pushed Jeb or someone else who wasnt a sociopathic liar. Its like a dream come true, congress, senate and president, all Republican led, and yet here we are up to our necks in shit.
I'm all for civil disobedience and would love to see the cowboys have to forfeit a game or two because of this ultimatum.
I wouldn't sadly because I am a cowboys fan lol
It's ridiculously dumb for the players to continue this.  They are going to continue to piss off their fans and the team's will lose revenue.  

Trying to take a tradition of honoring our troops and making it about the ways blacks are treated is stupid.  If they want to show support for that cause they should wear a patch or a certain color of socks or something like that.  Disrespecting our traditions isn't going to gain any support.
Good for him. It's a business. Make the money by giving the customers what they want. 
Just a suspension? Fire that bitch.

Disparaging remarks against Obama would’ve ended in never being able to work in broadcasting again. The double standards in this country are ridiculous. 
It's a crazy country we live in

Just depends I guess. Maybe if you say something like "gross sexual predators like Harvey W. and Donald T. should never be allowed in the Oval Office" it might work out. Let's see how this comment goes though.

As an Eagles fan, I think this is the only times I've rooted for the Cowboys. Good for him.
If it were for a valid cause, I'd be with you. Unfortunately, it's in support racist BLM idiots. Liberals are already likening the players to "slaves" on the "white man's plantation". I didn't realize slaves got paid millions of dollars.

It's all virtue signalling horseshit.
Are there a ton of liberal brigaders in here or something? Why is ever sensible post being downvoted?
Yes, they are always here trolling every post and comment.
She started a boycott of major ESPN sponsors: Ford, MillerCoors, AT&amp;T etc. I cannot imagine any comparable situation where the employee is not fired.


Veteran here.  I swore to protect and defend the constitution, including the right to free speech. I don't agree with what these players are doing, but I'll defend their right to do it. 

Threatening them for it is far more offensive to me than their taking a knee. 
Muh free speech! Right boys?
And strip your employees if their first amendment rights?
The business is more than free to threaten them. The first amendment applies to government. Not businesses. 
The president urging businesses to fire employees for their speech is, in my opinion, a violation of the constitution.  

Businesses aren't obligated to uphold the constitution the way that public servants are. That being said, Jerry Jones' statement is not consistent with the underlying principal.  He's certainly allowed to threaten to fire his employees, but he's a scumbag for doing so. He's much more of a scumbag than someone who feels it's necessary to take a knee during the national anthem. 
Opinion doesn’t matter when it comes to the constitution. It isn’t against the constitution. 
What? No. No one has those rights at work or else i could yell rat turds in a restaurant as the chef with no repercussions. It's not a free speech issue. 
I'm so glad that we have people like that in Congress to protect our rights and not try to take them away
/u/impeachtrump3 is a pedophile.
You just got done telling me that the first amendment applies to government, now you're saying the president urging private businessmen to act on it isn't an infringement? 

Legally, you *might* be right. Ethically and morally, you're absolutely wrong.
The president isn’t using government to do anything. He is using his own freedom of speech. If he threatened legal action or arrest or favors that would be an issue. 
I thought Dems said walls don't work...?
CNN: "White House spokesperson viciously attacks press corp."
Oh yes, thats a spectacular rebuttal. Why dont you actually invest some time into countering the argument instead of being a fucking idiot?
Posting an opinion from a far left zealot website to a Republican subreddit is being a fucking idiot.  Go suck on Hillary Clinton's balls ya douche
Ah yes, I understand now. Because someone posted from a source you dont like they must be a pedophile. That makes perfect fucking sense if you're a jackass. 
Trump talked shit. This guy was a serial predator.
Weird, she wasn’t actually asked the question the title raises.
She just doesn't get it. She still has no idea why she lost the election. 
What kind of piece of shit defends pedophiles.  You're disgusting.
Wow, the title was not kidding. What a great response. And he brought up a great point about the leaks in the context to privacy rights. Outlets like the NYT are quick to profess the importance of privacy rights...except if it pertains to someone they dislike politically, and then they can't get enough leaks.
Let’s all just hope she runs again in 2020
I might quibble with putting a number like 1% on it.  But, essentially, she's not wrong.  The anti-Clinton hysteria goes back 30 years.  Criticizing Trump is new.

Honestly I like her more then Spicer, she is doing a good job. 
Methinks he doesn’t know the meaning of the word “extortion”.
For full disclosure I supported Trump since the primaries, but I'm not a full-on kool aid drinker kinda supporter.

It entirely depends on how much the media continues to shit the bed. People hate their guts, but ultimately the sole criticisms I hear about Trump are:

1. Unprofessional
2. Impulsive
3. Narcissistic
4. Etc.

The people who hate him usually just spout the usual racist sexist kkk kinda rhetoric by blowing smaller words/actions out of order. These people can't be reasoned with, and can be beneficial to getting people to try conservative.

The hardline/moderate right wingers I talk to LOVE the hell out of him, and generally conduct themselves with tact which again, helps us.

My biggest concern is how weak the GOP has been in government. We have all three branches and they've done what exactly that us normal folks have been screaming?

I think if Trump can start cooling his jets (which after the last few speeches, I think he's already doing it) while keeping those balls that made him stand out, we have a good chance of term 2.

The ultimate wild card in all of this is what the DNC chooses to do. But part of me is even skeptical of that. They pull a Bernie? Reddit loses their mind but the majority of Dem voters hate the radical angle and skip out. Pull another Clinton? They satisfy the majority of Dem voters but it makes them seem like they learned nothing from Clinton.

I'm rambling at this point, but here's to hoping. 
He got to where he is bc he had a connected dad, not bc he was bright 
[removed]
If trump doesn't cool off, Hillary will blow him out of the water in 2020... We need Trump to step up and garner approval from the snowflakes or prep for the worst. 
I see Rand Paul from Kentucky making big strides towards running in 2020 as a libertarian. He will get my vote. 
Rand Paul attended Baylor and is a graduate of the Duke School of Medicine and is an eye surgeon.  

You on the other hand are a fucking moron.
And promptly wastes money on another Benghazi investigation. Decompose, Trey Gowdy.
I browse both democratic and republican subreddits on a semi regular basis, and you're so right when you say that people make mountains out of molehills. It honestly feels like there are few people of reason.

Ultimately, I think it will come down to who the democratic candidate is. I don't know who, but just about anyone would be better than the two presented at the last election. And if the republicans can't get their act together and start making positive progress (above and beyond repealing unconstitutional executive orders, as those will eventually run out) I don't see trump making a second term.


Unsurprisingly, republicans are the only ones with the moral courage to speak up about things like this, yet again. 
When pigs can fly that is.
What kind of piece of shit just accuses people of pedophilia just because they didnt like something they posted online? That would be you, you're that piece of shit.
Victim shaming? You're right, Republicans ARE the only ones who think it's the right thing to do.
Could also be that no one is showing up to these book signings.

fucking stupid.

Liberals look to the dumb and dumber guy for their opinions 
As a life-long Republican, I feel his pain.
Why do you associate all Republicans with the opinion of an extremely small minority of evangelical leaders?
You're missing his point. There's a plethora of half-truths, mis-truths and outright lies that make up the GOP's current platform.

The specific example here (which is a line from a TV show), is meant to illustrate that point.
&gt;There's a plethora of half-truths, mis-truths and outright lies that make up the GOP's current platform.

Like what?  Some examples please, you know, as one Republican to another.
Cutting taxes (especially corporate taxes and taxes on the highest earners) improves the overall economy and the middle class.

Coal is coming back.

Federal lands (including national parks) should be given to the states and/or sold off.

Climate change is not real.

Gay marriage/rights are an assault on society.

Life and human rights begin at conception.

Abstinence education is enough.

Campaign money is speech.

More military spending at the expense of other programs.

Environmental regulations are killing business and should be eliminated.
FAKE NEWS. 
to be fair, there is a large ultra religious contingent of people out there that think scientific phenomena are directly tied to social issues.  The overwhelming majority of them are republican. some big names on this are ann caulter, kevin swanson and yahuda levhin (did I spell that right?) who blamed hurricanes on gay marriage, pat robinson blamed the 1994 earthquake on gays, and cindy davis blamed the 2005 dead birds on the repeal of don't ask/dont tell.  Some of these people are the religious voice for millions of primarily republican americans.

Is this sarcasm? Grassley confirmed man. 
Great, so you have no problem with full-scale investigations into presidents both sitting and past, yes? Excellent news.
Is this another “Benghazi”? Because that found sooo much evidence. /s
So, I’m supposed to listen to one guy on YouTube and not the people who study this topic professionally every working day of their career? If you did that with your health, you probably wouldn’t live long.
Well I don't know about that, since 'Murricans live TERRIBLY. They are fat, stupid and lazy. Any of this score home? 
Yet the brainless sheep that are liberals and democrats would gladly elect them president if they could I am sure 
What does this old story have to do with being republican? 
Well, obesity is demonstrably on the rise and I often hear from certain individuals on the right intense criticism of America’s schools and how Americans need to work harder or are lazy. Sooooooo ...
Trump wants to keep culture wars flaming and wants them to permeate every sector of society to keep us divided. He think people attach more to cultural issue than tax reform or Healthcare. Other than that literally nothing.

I think it's a pretty easy bipartisan thing to say sexual assault is bad and maybe Hollywood/famous people are as a lumped group are a bit hypocritical. 
What is this for?
Looks like they are doing a white paper on conservatives specifically targeting drug policy and the death penalty. 
Yeah, okay, sure, whatever. Try presenting evidence which says voters care more about that issue than any other and you might have something.
It’s definitely a thing to be concerned about, not just because the next billionaire may be a dem, but because if Trump is the example billionaires don’t know how operate in an environment where they can’t just fire their coworkers (Congress). 
Tucker Carlson has FAS
Dumb video title. That's not "CNN", that's Noah Rothman, noted conservative at Commentary magazine, being interviewed on CNN, talking about how reporting on Trump in general is sensationalist crap.

Trump has worked with Congress to pass more legislation than any president since Truman.  So technically he's more skilled at being an executive than every president since 1953.

Where is the proof of bot? Posting in a lot of subs, yes. Spamming, depends on the definition. Bot, no proof from that pic.
So, the video title is the actual “fake news”?
Posting in the exact same subreddits, in the same order, at the same times, with the same inhuman speed, with the same randomly generated username.

Yep. Completely real.
Anyone who posts 10 plus times of political content of the same link and barely comments on anything is probably a bot in my book or a spammer with a suspicious agenda.

Even if they are neither why should we even care about them if they aren't interested in commenting, what the entire website was designed for. 
You're not going to get very far trying to debunk the "fake news" thing by posting your own fake news.

Bold faced lies...that's why she's not president. 
"There's no shortage of uranium." Ok buddy, let's just throw up our hands and let the norks run amuk. 
I don't know what to think about this. IN two ways.  First it's not the greatest pizza in the world.   But people have different tastes. Maybe they like the bread-like stuff.   But I do like the owner of the company.  He's a very nice man.

Second, I don't know why people want to be at war with themselves over the NFL.  No more Patriot fans?  No worship of Tom Brady?    No more Steeler fans?    No Bears?

These are the things I remember from growing up.  That at one point football took over from baseball and became America's sport "We're number 1, High Mom!" 

And this is a kind of self hate.  I don't think self-hate is very good for people and maybe we all just need to get over it.

In the mean time, I like a little local chain called "pizza guys" and our NFL team is moving a way.  

C'est la vie...Viva Las Vegas I guess.

Did you fall for your own misleading headline?  Wow.   This isn't "CNN admits", this is "Guy interviewed on CNN claims".  

[I'd love to hang with Papa John!](https://m.imgur.com/r/funny/EVOgJq1)
Yes!  
Oh it's worse than that.

In 2002 a woman who had come out as lesbian took her ex-husband to court to get full custody of her children as she had proof that her ex-husband was physically abusing her children. A circuit court in Alabama ruled in favor of her husband and then was overturned by the Supreme Court of Alabama, claiming substantial evidence that abuse was happening.
Roy Moore wrote the dissenting opinion (direct quote from his opinion).
"To disfavor practicing homosexuals in custody matters is not invidious discrimination, nor is it legislating personal morality. On the contrary, disfavoring practicing homosexuals in custody matters promotes the general welfare of the people of our State in accordance with our law, which is the duty of its public servants. Providing for the common good involves maintaining a public morality through both our criminal and civil codes, based upon the principles that right conscience demands, without encroaching on the jurisdiction of other institutions and the declared rights of individuals.
The State carries the power of the sword, that is, the power to prohibit conduct with physical penalties, such as confinement and even execution. It must use that power to prevent the subversion of children toward this lifestyle, to not encourage a criminal lifestyle"
This disgusting human being believes executing other humans based on their sexual orientation is better than allowing them to raise children.
Where a party can get into power with a 12.6% majority? No thanks 
I fully agree, Moore holds absolutely reprehensible views. 
nepotism
Probably =/= proof.
You’ve never had multiple tabs open in a browser?
Major donor?  $20,000 to a Pac is a major donor?  

OP you are an idiot for believing this has anything to do with Trump or donations made to a PAC that Trump himself denounced as a candidate.
Who gives a fuck why should we listen to these worthless contributors. Reddit is an anonymous website, so there will never be "enough" proof for anything like this. You can slam your head on a brick wall over proof until it bleeds trying to find it for each user before they make a new account but you will just waste your time. 

Probably good enough for me to not listen to literally anything they say, downvote it, and report it.

If they want to post 40 articles a day, they can spend more time backing them up.

**And it looks like their account was banned or whatever for spamming or deleted out of fear of being called out.** 
Our President would not have passed a competency test. 
If nobody managed to bust Clinton after all these years, it's not going to happen ever. 
To whom? 
Hitler and Mussolini were veterans. Trump has a bone spur. 
20K seems like a non insignificant amount to donate to a candidate, as it bypasses the 2.5 k limit that individuals can donate. Can you actually play devils advocate without resorting to ad hominem attacks?
As someone from Alabama, I will be voting for Doug Jones. Moore is a pitiful asshole.
We need proportional representation.
Trump has been accused of sexual assault and even alluded to it on tape.
Didn't he promise to drain the swamp?  There's a reason this Flake has an 18% approval rating in AZ.
So much that the author is missing. You can't moan and complain that the populist wing of the party isn't electing "true" Republicans when the so-called "true" Republicans like Flake, Corker, McCain, etc. have been in government for decades and have done jack squat for the conservative movement.

When's the last time we had tax reform?  Or repealed terrible progressive laws?  Or regulations? Or passed more permissive gun legislation?  Or passed immigration reform?  Or border security?

You can't just sit in DC for a few decades and do nothing and just blame all the problems on the Democrats.  Sure, the Democrats cause a lot of the problems, but if you're not doing anything about it, you need to be replaced by someone who will.

Trump isn't the cause.  Trump is an effect of a Republican base that's fed up with an establishment that is unwilling to do anything except let the lunatics on the Democratic fringe drive the debates and the legislation.

Exactly, they hired a third party to do the collusion in their place.

Why are you posting links to anti-Republican sources on one of the few pro-Republican subreddits?  Is having full control over every thing on r/all not enough?  What a faggoty asshole piece of shit you are.  
Where can I read about the third party they hired?
Clinton hired law firm Perkins Coie, who in turn hired Fusion GPS, who worked closely with Russian sources to create the 'trump russia dossier' which was then provided to Senators, FBI, and media under the pretense that it was a British Intelligence report.

Don’t say faggoty. Makes you look like an asshole. 
So, Hillary is guilty of knowing someone who knows someone who knows someone? I’m surprised the GOP leadership don’t all have hernias from that stretch. Wouldn’t the party be better served by showing how it’s platform makes the lives of Americans better? Is it really helpful to keep campaigning against someone not in office and not running for office?
She paid 9 million to have this dossier created and distributed, it's not a friend of a friend... it's paying someone to commit crimes for you.  You all act like collusion is a huge problem, and now that the proof comes out you say she isn't running for office anymore so who cares if she committed treason.  
[deleted]
There is a social justice warrior sub. Go there. 
I’m a republican and this “Hillary colluded with Russia” stuff is the weirdest and lamest attempt at a redirect I’ve ever seen.  It’s like saying if I hired a private eye who interviewed someone that J collided with the person interviewed.  That makes no sense. 
I’m a Republican, and I think this sub needs challenged.  Echo chambers are bad for growth, and their have been some seriously weak arguments made in here, mostly from accounts that spam videos to 50 subreddits at once.  I don’t think it’s pro-republican to ignore uncomfortable facts or to share false info, yet that’s what I see here often. 


But dems claimed trump Jr (aka an employee of the trump.campaign, hired by Trump) met with a Russian about the campaign that was collusion.  But when fusion GPS, hired by Clinton, does the exact same thing but then uses that data to try to sway the election AND tries to deceive the FBI by claiming it was from British Intelligence.  I'll let the courts decide, but it's clear the Clinton's spent a lot of money to get info from Russia and used it, while Trump's campaign met with 1 Russian and used none of the information.
They claim they didn’t get or use anything, but the Trump family lies about things they can be proven wrong about, I don’t really trust them to not lie when they believe we can’t prove them wrong.   There’s also a tremendous difference between an investigator using contacts/sources and a representative  of a campaign meeting a representative of a government.  
I think Republicans, Democrats and their constituents who vehemently  dislike clinton should appoint a special investigator to get to the bottom of this.

(Trite sarcasm I didn't read the article, I'm just a passer-by!)
You can't trust them?  The email said this Russian would provide "official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia".  DID YOU SEE ANY OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS ABOUT HILLARY'S DEALING WITH RUSSIA DURING TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN?  Then they didn't fucking use any of it, right?
Hillary didn’t deal with Russia, so there weren’t any.  Besides, wasn’t it originally about “adoption policies?”  And previously undisclosed until someone was about to expose it?

Of course I don’t trust them.  Here are some reasons why.  And it’s old!  He told three more whoppers this past week regarding GDP growth, the collusion investigation, and Michael Moore’s broadway show.  


https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html

That list is verifiable factual lies.  An overwhelming amount of them can not even be chalked up to a difference in opinion.  So why would I believe anything he, or his associates, say?  There’s no such thing as an “alternative fact.”  Only facts, and the facts don’t support his claims or policies.  
Why are you moving the goalposts?  At first you said you didn't believe that Trump didn't use the Russian data, now you are saying there wasn't any Russian data?  Which is it?  And I don't know what the meeting was about since I wasn't there, but I have read the email, and according to the email it was about Russian documents proving collusion, which the Trump campaign either never had or never used.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/11/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-email-text.html

And this list of lies is just nonsense.  Obama says he'll shut down Guantanomo, stop borrowing against the national debt, calls his wife Michael twice, says you can keep your doctor, and Trump's a liar because he said he was on the cover of Time 14 or 15 times, but it was actually 11.  Where's the NY Times article on the list of Obama lies so we can compare?  Maybe the Mexican that owns NY Times has a bias against Trump?  What's that, they never did a list of Obama lies?  


Obama said ISIS was 'jv'... nah, they are fucking varsity.  He said the steel industry produces as much steel as it used to (false) and that it only needs 1/10 th of the people to do the same amount of work (false).  He said most young americans weren't covered by health insurance, which was false.  He said 'we have doubled the distance a car can go on a gallon of gas" which was false.  He said healthcare premiums went up slower under Obamacare than at any time in the last 50 years which was false.  Here's a few dozen more Obama whoppers, from the left leaning politifact, owned by the Tampa Bay Times, who backed Clinton for president! :

http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/statements/byruling/false/

But you don't care, you just hate your own Republican president.  Fucking asinine.
Trump, or a minion, most assuredly colluded with Russia.  I took your meaning that they were going to expose Clinton’s dealings with the Russians.  My point was that she hasn’t had any meaningful business with them, so what was there to expose.  If they had some, that would be out by now.

I don’t fault Trump for simple common hyperbole, like trying to take credit for the current market climb.   He is full of shit of that, but every President does it.  It annoys me, but not like actual lies.

I do hold presidents accountable for broken promises, but consider the context when i do it.  I don’t however accuse them of lying.  “No new taxes”, “wmd’s” “keep your doctor”, and Trump’s own “3% sustained growth pledge” all strike me as sincere promises or claims that were, or likely will be, interrupted by reality.  I might judge them all for being naive, but i wouldn’t call them liars on any of those.

I took a little while to peruse your user history. Can you point to any of your own posts that would back up your claim of being Republican? I see you are against a few right leaning people, and that's all. Not pro any right leaning people, or against any left leaning people. If you are a Republican, you're doing a shit job of expressing yourself.

And there's good reason for Trump to take credit for the current market climb. It literally started the day he won the election, and it's called the Trump Bump by economists. CEOs like lower taxes and less regulation, and it shows in the stock market. The market only grew 1% per year of each of Obama's last 2 years, and grew 25% in Trump's first year. Hate Trump or not, but his Republican views of regulation and taxes ought to be something a self-proclaimed Republican like yourself would support.



Well, in fairness to myself, I’ve only been on reddit for just over a year.  For most of that year, the Republicans have owned both Chambers of Congress and the White House, so of course they’re going to catch most of my ire.  Democrats are impotent when it comes to passing laws right now, I can’t really be mad at them for anything.  They can’t even stop a law.  

I am against quite a few of the biggest names on the right, though in my opinion, they don’t represent any actual conservatism.  Conservatism was supposed to be the thoughtful pragmatic party making small, incremental changes when necessary, blind to race color and creed.  I can get behind that, and still do.  Limbaugh, Hannity, and Coulter are all just cynically riding a conservative money train, and the alt-right heroes are even worse.  Conservative columnist I do like is George Will, who left the party over Trump.  He is, without a doubt, one of the smartest conservative minds in politics right now, and our party called him a RINO and said good riddance.  Ben Shapiro at least seems consistent in his views, but engages in cheap logical fallacies in his arguments too often.  Beating up college kids is easy when you make a living arguing, and it makes great videos, but his arguments aren’t as solid as he likes to think. 

The last 8+ years have seen conservatism get away from core conservatism and get closer to “do and say anything to win”, including embracing identity politics and sometimes overt racism.  I had to ask myself why people waving the symbols of the Confederacy and Nazis were on my side, and I didn’t like the answer.  Former editors at Breitbart reported Bannon was more than happy to court and harness that groups energy, even if he personally claims to reject their views. 

I love McCain and always have.  I would have happily voted for Rubio or Kasich against Hillary.  All of those guys have crossed the aisle and worked on controversial bills because it needed done.  They respect their offices and constituents.  Ted Cruz is a purist and would rather shut it all down than compromise.  He’s emblematic of what’s going to make our party a minority soon.  

TL;DR I am an old school Republican that places character above policy points.  When policy preferences conflict with each other, I try to resolve them and prioritize them.  I think the party currently just ignores its inconsistencies and prioritizes whatever is the topic at hand.  Above all else it prioritized winning without a plan to follow up the win, and it stretched the truth in that effort to a degree I’m not comfortable with.   It chooses to engage in distracting culture wars out of spite instead of wanting to make a more perfect union, and that’s just disappointing.  Trump is the walking manifestation of that.
I guess I'm the exact opposite.  I didn't support Trump for his character, I supported him so he could enact his policies of lower taxes, less regulation and common sense immigration policy.  

I agree with much of what you said though I can't stand the argument that the party is racist because racists support the party.  Black Nationalists and LA Raza members have been pro Democrat for just as long... it seems like the party that gets the most white votes gets the white racists, and the party with the most minority votes gets the minority racists.  But we live in a world that only condemns white racism, although statistically whites commit far less violence against other races than vice versa.  It's bizarro world when the media explains it.
The whole party isn’t necessarily racist because it has racists, but there are some policies/positions with racist intent/overtones that get alot of traction.  It’s not in-your-face racism, but still subtly there.  The sudden upswing of racist support and enthusiasm in the last election was real and provable.  The reason? Trump’s platform.  It’s okay to look at your candidates platform objectively and disagree with it, though the conservative disagrees vehemently.  


An example is the kneeling controversy; a totally unnecessary culture war.  The President should be MILES above engaging in it, let alone stoking it.  As a small govt, Republican that believes in the Constitution, I HAVE to support the kneelers.  Not just because it’s their right, but because every person in the country should know what it’s like to not know fear when talking to police.  Try to talk to other “conservative” people about it though, invariably the claim comes out that maybe “black people should’t be thugs”.  This happens every time, or a phrase with similar meaning.  To hell with that!  These same people will usually start their defense of police with innocent sounding reasons, press them on it, and point out the problems in the argument and out comes the racism.  Officers are supposed to be professionals working to serve and protect within their community.  Instead it’s far too common to see cops treating the entire community as an adversary, with a gun in every waistband and dope in every pocket.  The innocent residents of any ghetto should get the same treatment as the innocent residents of any gated community, and they don’t.  That is an offense to conservative values, and administration pretending like it isn’t is a betrayal of those values.  This is one reason the racists support the “law &amp; order” rhetoric, despite it not being overtly racist.  They know who’s going to get beat up, jailed, and shot, and it won’t be them. 

I also don’t see  much sense in his immigration policies.  The costs of rounding up that many people, regardless of what they’ve done here, especially DACA recipients is outrageous, and that’s just the financial cost.  And the rhetoric behind it is ridiculous.  Leftist immigration groups called Obama the Deporter-in-Chief because he deported so many more illegals than anyone else before.  Yet the republican rhetoric made it sound like he was shipping mexicans in by the boatload. It wasn’t true.  He achieved the higher rates by prioritizing who ICE targeted.  Leave the otherwise law abiding ones alone, and target the ones actually commit crime.  The immigration courts are already overflowing again, and it’s because they’re back to non-discretionary enforcement.  That’s the exact opposite of “common sense”.   The wall doesn’t make sense either.  Most of the immigrants and drugs come through checkpoints, by plane, by boat or over/under already existing sections of wall.  That’s why those sections are there, instead of in the middle of the desert.  Some come through the open desert but it’s rare compared to the other ways. The wall will cost billions, and likely have zero impact on anything coming across.  It’s really just going to be a big monument, and that’s after we use imminent domain to cut off some natural born Americans from their own property.  

I like and support lower taxes and regulation, but both of his plans seem pretty poorly thought out on this. His numbers on taxes only work if you use a method of scoring that no one uses(dynamic scoring), and even then it only works if he can maintain unheard of growth. That seems irresponsible, and indicated to me that it’s all bullshit.  The regulations, though, I prefer thoughtfulness.  My dad lost his job to acid rain regulations in the 90’s.  I hated all regulations then, but here we are with provably higher quality air and water.  Are those regulations still bad?  Every regulation should be reviewed for effectiveness and impact, but a blanket removal only looks childish.  The remove 2 for every 1 new regulation rule is something an idiot would come up with.  The regulations exist for a reason, and should only be removed if they either didn’t have an impact or the unintentional impacts exceeded predictions.  

Which brings me to my next concern for the party in general.  We will be banished to the minority for a generation if we keep spitefully rejecting science.  It will happen.  When things happen that disagree with our political preferences, like Obama’s sustained if slow economic growth, or the warming planet, we should adjust our policies to fit the facts.  We should not adjust the facts to fit our positions.  That’s dangerous to the country, and like the ACA repeal efforts demonstrate, dangerous to the party.   The ACA, by the way, bent the healthcare cost curve down, but you wouldn’t know it from listening to our speak about it.  

That’s enough of a text wall.  Remember, this is supposed to be the big tent party, and kicking out people that would be allies is the exact opposite of that.  Have a good one! 
Wait, so, if someone tries to break a law and trying to break said law is itself illegal, that’s perfectly okay? This sounds more like “It’s okay if you’re a republican.” Either wring is wrong or it’s not; there is no “sometimes”. But more importantly *Hillary is not in office* and the only people who keep dragging her up are *Trump loyalists*. How pathetically cultish does one have to be to keep doing that? How blind does one have to be to fail to see the difference?
Being respectful to others isn't a political issue, it's called being a good person. You know good and well that saying shit like that isn't going to fly. Think about it. 
You're in the wrong sub for respectful discussion of others.
Tucker Carlson is a liar. No surprise he's making up crazy shit.
Sure, now that they make the budget, deficits and debt are *good*. How 50% of the population hasn't wised up to this I have no idea.
Trump sure as hell ain't helping, though. 
Why haven't the mods corrected this brutally misleading title?
But you presume they tried to break a law.  They met with someone.  They may have looked at the information and politely declined, they may have turned the matter over to authorities, there may have been no documents at all.  So far the FBI agrees with me in that no crime was committed.
Blacks are 13% of the population, 23% of the ones killed by police, 43% of the ones who kill police, and 50% of the murderers.  

http://www.snopes.com/do-police-kill-more-whites-than-black-people/

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/09/are-black-or-white-offenders-more-likely-to-kill-police/?utm_term=.25c525d55a8e

https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/race-and-homicide-in-america-by-the-numbers

Claiming police are the problem ignores the facts.  I support every Americans right to freedom of speech, but if they use that speech to claim cops are bad for blacks, then I'm going to point out the facts.  Ignoring the falsely placed police hatred, which has led to several police shootings by black nationalists, is not supporting freedom of speech.  To make all of that worse, they insult the country by using the national anthem as their moment to bring attention to themselves.  Sure, they have the right to do it, and can't be arrested for doing it, but fuck them for it, it's a dickhead thing to do.  The U.S.A. has lost lives and money to fix the racial injustices of the past, and to continue to act like whites bear racial hatred against blacks is foolish.  In this country, whites account for 72% of the U.S. population, but only 48% of hate crime offenders.

https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2015-hate-crime-statistics

And to act like the president wanting to stand for the anthem is race based, while Obama said Treyvon Martin looked like his son would have looked, is madness. 

Obama is claimed to have 'deported' more people than any other president, but his actual deportations (5 million) were HALF of Clinton or Bush's (both over 10 million):

https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/obama-record-deportations-deporter-chief-or-not


And the ACA resulted in “enrollment-weighted premiums in the individual health insurance market increased by 24.4 percent beyond what they would have had they simply followed…trends.”

https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/07/28/overwhelming-evidence-that-obamacare-caused-premiums-to-increase-substantially/#6681d58f15be

I could go on, but as you say the text wall is too big already.  I stand by my initial statements that you sound like every Democrat I've ever debated.  You defend Obama, but attack Trump, Hannity, Coulter, Cruz... very odd, and meekly acknowledged a couple that you would vote for over Hillary.  The only Republican you actually voiced support of is the most hated Republican in the party.  A man who ran on appeal of Obamacare, and voted against the repeal of Obamacare.  

This might be unpopular here, but as a conservative, I firmly believe anyone who can pass a physical fitness test, meantal health check, and is willing to put their life on the line for this great country should be allowed to serve. Just as much as anyone who causes problems or at any point or prove themselves unfit for service should be removed immediately. It doesn't matter what hardware you've got under the hood, what you want to call yourself, or who you spend your time with off-duty, if you can eliminate terrorists, repair planes, or process intelligence, and the afformentioned things aren't a distraction for you, why wouldn't there be a spot for you?
That would be great, if the physical fitness tests were the same across the board, but they're not. I agree that anyone fit to serve should be allowed to serve, but there needs to be a single standard, not one for men and one for women. 
It's less than 50% and they draw the electoral boundaries since 2010
&gt;meantal health check

Thats the rub right there.  How can you pass a mental check when you're a walking mental disorder?

I love anyone who wants to serve our country, but there have to be rules.

**Homosexuality in ancient Rome**

Homosexuality in ancient Rome often differs markedly from the contemporary West. Latin lacks words that would precisely translate "homosexual" and "heterosexual". The primary dichotomy of ancient Roman sexuality was active/dominant/masculine and passive/submissive/feminine. Roman society was patriarchal, and the freeborn male citizen possessed political liberty (libertas) and the right to rule both himself and his household (familia).

"Walking mental disorders" are already serving just fine. If you look into first, it may change your perspective. A guy I served with transitioned after we all got out, and he was a stellar soldier and leader. Would never have guessed he felt he was supposed to be a woman, because it never effected his job.

Totally. First-past-the-post gets even worse. I strongly support PR since in any system with more than 1 party, no party gets 50%+ ever (except if you're North Korea and don't care about democracy)
How did the kkk vote did they vote republican or democrat
The KKK was started by Democrats and they even recently made endorsements for the DNC Chairman.

Should he be removed? 
It always surprises me how much more disappointed I can be in my own party. Pennsylvania is a closed primary state, so I feel an obligation to remain a Republican so I can support republicans in the primary who aren’t radicals or haven’t sold themselves out in an effort to ride this President’s coat tails. How can trying to obstruct this investigation be in line with the ideals of law and order, personal responsibility, America first, etc. that were once fundamental principles in my party as I grew up with it. I find it a shame.
Mueller is implicated in the pay for play Uranium One scandal and he's hired numerous former Clinton campaign operatives as part of his investigation into Russian meddling.

He shouldn't even have to be asked to step down, he should recuse himself immediately.
I can understand your frustration there. Who would you recommend take his place in the special investigation? 
[removed]
I'd like to see Trey Gowdy lead the investigation.
I fear that a lot of R’s are blinded by trumpism/hyper-nationalism and try to eject mueller as a means to simply sweep the special investigation under the rug. Gowdy seems like he’s willing try to impartially get to the bottom of the issue. Or a time least he has admitted his support to allow Mueller to continue uninterrupted... just without the leaks.

I believe the time has come for the Republican party to champion Black Americans. To loudly and unceasingly celebrate their contributions, to mourn what was done to them. And most importantly to start making good faith steps to right the multitude of destructiveness that has been rained upon them.  The answer here is by no means to merely give them money.
The problem, of course, is that most of the voices calling for 'reparations' only want a check.
Absolutely true.
It's never been discussed in any other terms. It's necessary to expand the conversation, to open up people on all sides with new ideas
America doesn't owe black people anything.  Thats the problem with many in the black community, they are waiting for someone else to do something for them when they should be doing it themselves.  End the dependency on governmemt mentality.
I am really sorry for breaking the republicans only rule. Just wanted to say that we need more people like yourself. Thank you for being an American first and having allegiance to the constitution instead of some political party. 
They hid bot tweets, not people.
No
This scandal was created by media to destroy his character and his credibility among Republican voters. There is not an investigation into it by any law enforcement. Politicians are using this for political points to appease Trump and keep their voters happy when they should be fighting for the dignity of the Presidency. 

What power does HRC have from her couch? Her political career is over. And if you believe she is a criminal, then why can't we investigate Trump with a non-partisan law enforcement official? Gowdy is a politician now.

Keep fooling yourselves.
Only of the Republicans want to commit suicide.
Hilarious.
&gt;This scandal was created by media to destroy his character and his credibility among Republican voters.

So you believe The Hill and the NYT's are secretly in the pocket of the Republican Party?

Mueller is a Republican so what exactly do you mean we need a non-partisan?

Since when have we been a nation that allows people to walk away from crimes just because they no longer matter?

You seem to be ridiculously uninformed about everything.
How Republicans feel is of no issue.  Mueller is implicated in the Uranium One scandal, that alone is reason for recusal.  How can we expect a person to be impartial in an investigation into Russian meddling when that person was part of a pay for play with Russian officials to sell of 20% of our uranium?

It's asinine to believe Mueller is the only person capable of leading an impartial investigation on the matter.
When you give a person increased capabilities, they are going to use it. 
This article it not very well written.

&gt; a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines was passed in 1994. It was lifted in 2004.

 It was a ban on new sales of some magazines, yes, but with so many already in circulation, it's not at all clear that this really did much.

&gt;Experts said lifting the ban helped to usher in a new era of mass shootings. With these weapons, individuals could shoot faster and for longer periods of time - and consequently were able to kill more people in their attacks.

Which experts said this, and what data support this conclusion?  Most people don't think we have reliable evidence that the AWB affected crime.  
&gt; Thats the problem with many in the black community, they are waiting for someone else to do something for them when they should be doing it themselves.

Get a fucking load of this guy. Right, right, sure. Because institutions, laws, and other measures havent been created to hold them back. Neither has voting been rigged to delegitimize their voices and education been slashed by boards for profits. Perhaps you ought to measure the outcome of programs intended to raise people up, that have actually failed. Its not like institutional racism exists, or else why would we have a name for it? This may be old, but its still relevant, I suggest you read from a black persons perspective instead of leaving such arrogant comments. https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-progress-how-far-weve-come-and-how-far-we-have-to-go/
I find it hard to believe "hundreds more" would fit into a church, or that he could have shot more people after he already left. Its like our President were tv show, and he was digging for ratings by chance.
Sounds great. Now how about some of that trickle down? Cause I got bills to pay.
Another video, another fake map of counties red and blue. Wonder how many times people are going to use that fake map.
Thanks.
This is America, if you want it you can get it.  The Chinese were slaves in this country, they are a minority, and they were impoverished; yet they managed to dig their way out.

It's hard to feel sorry for people complaining about how politicians aren't helping them when they vote for the same party for decades.  Black entrepreneurship peaked under Ronald Reagan, yet the vast majority of blacks still vote Democrat.  Black unemployment has begun to plummet under Trump, yet many call him a racist.

Enough complaining, fix the stupidity in the thinking and get ahead.
How about you get a job and earn your own money so you can pay your own bills.  Stop waiting around for people to take care of you.

Fake?
Must be hard to wrap your brain around the truth huh..
LoL. Wow. Not only do you make my job really easy by taking the bait, but you respond exactly how I wanted you to so I can rebuke your bullshit from [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/7az203/maybe_republicans_should_back_a_new_kind_of/dpe9ds2/). 

u/FranklinAbernathy first of all, capitalism claims to have a trickle down effect, boosting the lower classes with production, thus growth, and economic investment back into the workers themselves and increasing the welfare of all citizens. It has clearly failed to do this as wages have stagnated for the last 30 some years and all return has been lodged with the upper class as the rich get richer and the poor have stayed poor. Tax breaks and incentives for the rich only benefit the rich, this is fact. If you would like to use factual arguments instead of crybaby whiny assumptions, I'd be happy to hear your rebuttal.

Second of all, lets address your assumptions. Yesterday you said 
&gt;Thats the problem with many in the black community, they are waiting for someone else to do something for them when they should be doing it themselves.

which is total bullshit because you obviously just assume things instead of attempting to be informed. Example: you attempt to insult me here and say get a job and earn your own money. LOL. What a fucking joke. I have a job, and full benefits, and I'm a Veteran that did 7 years. I'm very much a big boy and take care of myself, my family, my mortgage and on and on. You just like to jump to conclusions or assume things so it fits your bullshit dialogue.

So, that being said. Go fuck yourself, and learn to pick arguments you can win with facts instead of assumptions and making yourself look like the asshole. 
My county in that map is painted red when it was blue. Yes, fake map. Hard to understand, isnt it?

edit: downvote all you like, its not like I'm fucking wrong.

Peaked you say? Hmmm, I wonder what kind of economic rebranding helped it tank afterwards. I suggest you refer back to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/7bcuxr/oneyear_since_trumps_win_us_funds_enjoy_strong/dpixlyx/) in case you havent read it yet, or reread it and the link included. 

edit: typo
Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. And safe spaces? You mean like the countless conservative subs which have banned me for being a Republican who despises Trump? Pretty sure thats text book definition of "safe spaces". 
&gt;Go fuck yourself, and learn to pick arguments you can win with facts instead of assumptions 

Ok chump.  There is no economic philosophy called "trickle down economics", fact.  There is an economic philosophy called supply-side economics which is the philosophy that lower taxes and reduced regulations promote growth, increase competition which lowers the price of goods and services, and increases wages.  

So for an example of supply-side economics the best example we have is the Reagan Administration.  The Reagan Administration added over 20 million jobs, increased wages, decreased poverty, and led to the longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation's history.  Reagan was able to achieve this through lowering taxes, reducing regulations, reducing government spending, and decreasing the supply of money.

So now morons like you associate the economic philosophies of every president who decreased taxes with supply-side economics, but is that a fair comparison?  Trump not included, let's take a look.

Has any president since Reagan reduced government spending.. fuck no.

Has any president since Reagan reduced the supply of money...fuck no.  

Has any president since Reagan reduced regulations...double fuck no.

So why is an economic philosophy that isn't even being employed, responsible for everything wrong with the economy?  It's not, but dumb fucks like you and all the other useful idiot Democrats have been fooled into thinking tax cuts mean "trickle down" and that's bad.

You're an idiot, especially because you think you are smart and witty.  
If it doesnt exist why is the term used and why are there descriptions of it? Apparently clicking links and reading things isnt your strong point, albeit your mastery of shit talking on reddit. Does any of this negate that you're an assuming prick? Nope. I may not be the best economist, but you're still an assumptive asshole. 
&gt;If it doesnt exist why is the term used and why are there descriptions of it? 

Because it's used by politicians to easily fool and persuade ignorant voters.

**The term trickle-down originated as a joke by humorist Will Rogers and today is often used to criticize economic policies which favor the wealthy or privileged, while being framed as good for the average citizen. In recent history, it has been used by critics of supply-side economic policies, such as "Reaganomics".**

Hopefully that causes you to pause and think about the bullshit you've allowed yourself to lap up from politicians that are only concerned with keeping their power and influence over the American people.

You call me an asshole, but you're the one talking shit and being a lazy useful idiot who is ignorant to the fact that you've become a puppet for those that seek to control us while retaining their wealth and power.

You attack me but defend the real assholes.  No buddy, you're the asshole.

Apparently you're the only one who knows whats right in this conversation, and I'm just an "ignorant voter", yeah, okay, sure. Thats a fucking great way to make me want to consider anything you have to say. I will read the article you linked because I'm not a petty fuck, but I dont do it with much intrigue since its being delivered in such a condescending way. Its not like capitalism hasnt been promising this for decades, I'm the idiot. Right. 

Yes, I called you an asshole because you attack me. And you continue to do so. You're still an asshole. A presumptive one at that. Keep em coming, asshole. You know, you could always try to drive a point without being such a presumptive asshole. Might help in future dialogue. 
I'm just making fun of safe spaces m8
&gt;While ending the mandate could free funds up for a tax overhaul, it would also leave more people without health insurance: CBO estimated in December that 15 million more people would be uninsured if the mandate was ended, and premiums would increase 20 percent.

So it would save the federal government money but even less money than they claimed, drop 15 million people, and raise insurance rates even more than they already are.
Show us the real map then.
https://img00.deviantart.net/16ad/i/2016/319/0/2/2016__election_results_by_county_by_ynot1989-daoioo0.png
&gt;drop 15 million people

This is why it's important to read the CBO report yourself.  First, those numbers are for the next decade so that's a lot of time to come up with something better.  And it's not that 13 million would be dropped, it's that the majority of healthy people would stop buying insurance.  They would have their choice back, not dropped.

Also, these estimates are based solely on the mandate being repealed and no other factors or changes to the law.  We know that is not what the Republicans want to do, they want to overhaul our entire healthcare system.
Yeah just as I thought.
You don’t seem to understand the difference between County-Level Results and County/Voter Share Results.
You just presented the County/Vote Share results. The map in the video presents the County-Level results.
More people may have voted democrat in your county, but whoever the delegates were voted Republican, hence your county voting for Trump.

Your map basically helps explain why Trump lost the Popular vote, but the map in the video basically shows why he won the Electoral Vote. (The one that counts).
So you're saying my local delegates voted for Trump even though (s)Hillary won? I mean, I voted for douchey Trump on the premise of antiestablishment, but how can delegates not cast their vote for who won? I remember seeing this in the election results but didnt know it was so prevalent. Whats the point of individual votes if "delegates" can vote for whoever they want? Just more evidence of how the system is broken if thats the case. 
Mission accomplished! 
Why don't republicans ever try and build a medicare fraud commission. This would be much more effective for reducing government spending!
It’s always been like this.
It is an undemocratic system by design.

The United States has never been a Pure-Democracy. All of the founders thought Pure-Democracy was essentially Mob rule. Majority over the minority. This is why we are a Constitutional Representative-Democracy.
The founders spent more ink on the electoral process than anything else, because how we elect people to represent us is one of the more important things to consider. This is why the balance of power matters, and why having a majority of people vote for something is not always necessarily ok. Our representatives are there to represent us, not just have everything go to a popular vote.
This is why federalist principles are important, and why we don’t just want to be like Europe.
If the popular vote was the only thing that mattered, we’d be saying hello to Madam Clinton right now.

The electoral college is also why Presidential Candidates have to campaign in all the states that most people tend to ignore, the “Fly Over States”. Because they have voted that presidential candidates need. This is also why Swing-States are super important.

If the “People” picked Hitler, the electoral college would be there to negate that pick.

It’s a mostly confusing, somewhat sucky process, but mostly I’m content with the electoral college.

I understand your frustration with the process, why should your vote in a state mean nothing if a vote in another state would mean more, but this is part of the compromise the founders made to negate a “bad pick” by the people.

In your case, the people of your county voted for a delegate of the democrat party, who ended up voting Republican. 

The process of selecting delegates to represent the party is also different by both political parties. Some are bound and some are not bound to vote the way that their states vote.

It’s all a safe guard to prevent the will of “the people” or, “the majority”.  To prevent the “Mob” from completely deciding things over the minority. 
I understand the intent, purpose and design of the electoral college, I just have never really agreed with it on the basis of I believe one vote should equal one vote. Its difficult to reconcile with because I understand the concept of avoiding mob rule, but it also negates the concept of voting power if a delegate can do as they please instead of represent the vote as it were cast. I also did not know my county delegates voted Trump, nor would have had the inclination to do so. I live in a very liberal area that has a lot of conservative clingers hanging onto an old way of life that just doesnt really exist much anymore. I am a socially conscious humanist republican, I believe my gov't should fill certain roles, and no more. Its a difficult balance in this era of Trumpism and Tea Party politics. I constantly tread carefully.

Thanks for the thoughtful posts and not just name calling and being a douchey douche like most people resort to. I appreciate the time it took to share your insight and explanations. Perhaps I can find some time to mull it over further, and come up with some better ideas that could perhaps be more representative and fair at the same time. Kudos to you kind sir.
If its not made up then please explain why Shepard Smith wont cover it. 

A republican, on Fox News refuses to cover a story that could stop the a presidential investigator and put HRC in jail. That doesn't make sense unless the story is BS.
How do you know Shephard Smith is a Republican?  Why is he your barometer for what's true and what's false?


Sure thing, so how did you enjoy the rest of the video?

I think dude could tone back the rhetoric a little. “Pocahantas” is kinda too far. I dont care if Trump says it, he says a lot of dumb shit. Instead of drawings he could provide slides and data, to prove some claims. Im a skeptic by nature so I like sources of some kind. Other than that I like how succinct he is about  Brazilles revelations. I couldnt stand Hillary back in the 90’s, she lost back in 08 to Obama, I dont know why she ran again.  She’ll never win. Too many people dont trust her or dont like her, but who would have thought she’d go so far as cheating so well, only to fail against an 80’s guy turned reality tv show host. Its asinine. His other video put me to sleep. Lol.
If you've never seen CNN or MSNBC talk about the menendez trial you don't watch it for enough balance. They have been on trial for 65 days dumbass, it's on going, and there hasn't been much action in the past month because they are in trial. 

Moored stories just broke days ago. See the difference? It's all part of the news cycle. Also, dude is a fucking creep...I always like to think what my dad would have done if my 17 year old sister brought home a 30 year old man. (Would have whooped his ass to the curb). Any defense of Moore is bullshit. 

Here are a bunch of links showing the media covers menendez since mid September. There are hundreds more but here's a sample.

Since you’ve done so much of the legwork and know more about this material, perhaps you could boil it down to only successful cases of vote fraud, complete with full, independent, verifiable documentation of such. (We obviously don’t need to focus on the unsuccessful attempts because current procedures are obviously preventing those from being successful.)
Interesting to note that the first link I clicked on is actually about how Ohio's method of purging voter rolls might help Republicans in large metropolitan areas, as "voters have been struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods." (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/ohio-voter-purge/485357/?utm_source=feed)

A large share of these 406 "reports" are either completely off topic, only sourced by extremely right-leaning blogs or websites, or simply dead links (number 157 straight up has no link at all).

If you want to start a meaningful discussion about voter fraud, a Gish Gallop is not the way to go about it.
Cherry picking to discredit everything OP put out isn't really showing an effort to open a discussion as well.

Truth the Vote has a database of all the voter fraud cases they can find.  

https://truethevote.org/voter-crimes
They are purging voters who haven't voted for at least 6 years.  It's not a move to wipe out Democrats, it's simply because Democrats don't vote as routinely as Republicans.  From your source...

**"That’s because residents of relatively affluent Republican-leaning neighborhoods are more likely to vote in both congressional elections and presidential contests, historical turnouts show. Democrats are less likely to vote in mid-term elections and thus are more at risk of falling off the rolls."**

Thanks for wading through OP's dump. Sometimes when I find people being *really* wrong on the internet and I just *have* to set them straight, it can take a lot of time and energy to evaluate their sources and explain just how their "evidence" proves nothing and it's completely draining. Yet even then you're often talking to a brick wall and they were never going to be convinced anyways. I noticed a lot of Youtube links in the file and I don't have the time to sit through conspiracy theorists' and propagandists' crap presentations. And there were multiple InfoWars stories as well, and if anyone actually believes in those, it's absolutely fair to write them off.

This is interesting. 

In countries with proportional representation, the government is usually made as a coalition of parties.

I really think that America is ready for proportional representation. The debacle around the primaries showed how out of touch the political establishment is.
Well, they would need to establish a coalition to get them above 50%. That's how it works in countries with proportional representation.

Usually the coalitions are prearranged, based on the likely elections outcome scenarios.
My source? I am not OP.

What about what they wrote indicates cherry picking?
&gt;Interesting to note that the first link I clicked on is actually about how Ohio's method of purging voter rolls might help Republicans in large metropolitan areas


How does that indicate cherry picking? It doesn't indicate they were purposefully selecting a link which they knew would fit their agenda. As I read it's either I clicked the very first link, or a link was randomly sampled, and it contained [information]. 

It doesn't indicate cherry picking.
The first link is video footage of poll workers offering out of state ballots to people.  There are several others before the link that they "randomly clicked on" that cite voter fraud.

They then skip all of the stories from numerous national news outles and local affiliates to skip to 157 where there is no link.

It's cherry picking dude.  Hopefully your not really this stupid.
&gt; It's cherry picking dude. 

Maybe his post is cherry picking, but the part you indicated doesn't suggest it on it's own strongly enough to be convincing. You could be right, I just don't find the part you indicated on it's own to be compelling enough an argument.

&gt; They then skip all of the stories from numerous national news outles and local affiliates to skip to 157 where there is no link.

Is a more compelling argument for cherry picking. 
Very true. 
&gt;“Remember,” he said, “Trump beat both parties

Very true statement right there.
&gt;Surprise! I’m the creator!

I had a suspicious feeling for a second that might have been the case. I tried to be informative since you asked. I know, seeing Hillary shit is funny, yes, but for the serious effect make sure you cite some of these sources, it makes proving the claims within the video a lot easier, and try not to use any .com "news" sources, as we all know these days, bloggers act as if they are news sources when they arent. I see lots of "news" on blogs and people eat it up as if its reputable. You say you're in college, well, you should know this then. Cite, cite, cite.

As far as the Pocahontas thing, I mentioned that because it detracts from Natives. Theres a lot of indigenous people in this country, and with Trump using that as slander he's cutting off a ton of would be supporters from even considering him. Thats like asking for the black vote and calling Eminem a wigger, its not going to sit well and its not blatantly racist, but it is ignorantly racist speech. One can be conservative and inclusive of all people that make up this great nation. 

Keep it up. I've subbed to your channel. We'll see how far you go in the future. Good luck with school!
This is an analysis of Trump's chances of winning in NH and also the rest of New England. I think NH is a possible flip as it was so close in 2020. However, NH is really wealthy and educated. this may pose a problem for Trump.
John Oliver is a monumental idiot and so are his viewers.
I love it when liberals whine about Ivanka being an unpaid adviser, as if that's a) illegal, and b) bad for Democrats. She's a fucking Democrat, you idiots! She's pushing for half the things in Hillary's platform! I want her out too...because she's a Democrat. Oliver is such an ill-informed virtue signaling twat.
A 10 point bump, and all he had to do was leave the country and say very little on Twitter for a week. Ben Shapiro really nailed it. If he can do that for the next 3 years, it'll be the most successful administration in history.
If he is so stupid why don't you debunk some of his points.
What is your source that she is a democrat? And why is John Oliver ill informed? if he really is than debunk some of what he is saying.

His alleged lover never confirmed anything either, robbing the accusation of validity compared to Moore’s victims. 
Was that before or after he announced that he would not pursue an investigation because there was "not enough evidence?"

Is Sessions a deep state plant, guys? 
Agreed. Crybaby arguments like this don't hold water.

A story every day or two. 
Please explain why a person on Fox News (not MSM) refuses to cover the story
Very entertaining. I would like to see Trump's reactions to the ads shown in the end. In particular, given that this is not the 1st time.
Fox News employs numerous liberal democrats, I'm sure you could find several people who work for Fox News that would prefer no one would talk about the Uranium One scandal.

I'm failing to see how any of this pertains to anything.  Why is what Shepard Smith reports so important to you?  How is this important to the Uranium One scandal?  Why is he your barometer for what news is important and what is not?

You must realize how dumb your argument is, right?
&gt;robbing the accusation of validity compared to Moore’s victims.

The women accusing Moore are doing just that, accusing.  There is no proof that Moore did anything so saying "victims" is a bit overzealous and idiotic.
There are enough corroborating and similar accounts to evaluate his character and fitness for office.  Hell, he only bothered to deny two of five accounts, last I checked.  Plus, first person accusations always carry more weight than third person rumors.  That’s why they’re allowed in court.

Believing him over his victims demonstrates a severe misunderstanding of both victim and perpetrator behavior regarding sexual assault.  There’s a consistent pattern, and it is damning.  His reaction is even more damning.
https://youtu.be/yTSwknPgYCw 
This is not evidence either, and he even prefaces his claim by admitting to his bias. “You’re a good judge”.  Dude was removed twice for failing to uphold the law.   “Good judge “my fuzzy butt. 

Let’s not forget that he has a number of positions that are antithetical to republican and conservative philosophy.  One being, “People who commit homosexual acts should be arrested”.   Another being, “muslims should not be permitted to hold office”. Neither statement is compatible with our philosophy.  
&gt;This is not evidence either

That was my point.  Hopefully you see how overzealous and dumb it is to refer to these accusers as "victims".  Have a good one.
You have failed to make a valid point.  One dude’s opinion is not equivalent to dozens of independently corroborating stories. 
Meh, the Democrats have far more revolting beliefs and members within their mainstream than Republicans do.  The most revolting group within the Republican umbrella are white nationalists and racists, and Republicans don't defend them at all.  Meanwhile, communists and antifa are heavily defended by Democrats.

Roy Moore is a red herring.  If he is guilty of something, then indict him, convict him, and maybe then I'll condemn him.  But you'll have to excuse me if I don't judge him based on some opportune accusations from 40 years ago that surface the month before an election.
Me too
It doesn't matter. This argument, despite being true, is entirely ineffective.

&gt;is not equivalent to dozens of independently corroborating stories.

Dozens?  I was unaware that there are dozens of accusers.  I just looked it up and I see 6.  Where are you seeing dozens?  
Six victims, but they were tracked down due to over 30 people telling reporters about Moore’s affection for teens and giving them names of a few victims.  “Yeah i knew him.  He used to chase around this teenager, Sally Schmuckatelli.”

Reporters look up Sally. Sally confirms. 

Rinse and repeat for other names.
Let's play devil's advocate here.  Far left reporter and Gloria Alred who is notoriously full of shit find all of these women who claim all these events happened in the late 70's/early 80's.  Why is there nothing recent?  Pedophiles don't stop being pedophiles so Where are the recent accusations?  

Why is Gloria Alred involved?  She and David Brock were caught offering money to get people to accuse Trump, so is there no doubt when this woman is involved?

Brock who is a massive pile of monkey shit had his Trump attack plan leaked and it involves Alred as well as making accusations up and trying to bring endless lawsuits against anyone who supports or is part of the Trump Administration.

"Among those who have advised him on the plan is Hillary Clinton, who suggested to Brock in a phone call after the election that he should sign up some top-notch litigators who would do pro bono work against Trump. “She spoke about trying to construct a suit that would get you discovery on potential or alleged contacts between the Trump organization and the Russian government,” Brock remembers. Brock has since been in talks with attorney Gloria Allred to help fund the defamation suit she has led against Trump on behalf of a former contestant from The Apprentice, who has said Trump made unwanted sexual advances on her."

https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4641901/trump-inauguration-david-brock

It all seems like a bunch of bullshit to me and it wreaks of Brock/DNC/Clinton tactics.


Brock wasn’t “caught” offering money for dirt on Trump.  He announced it.  Much like Larry Flynt has recently done.  That’s not underhanded.  That’s also not the same as paying anyone to falsify a story.  Frivolous lawsuits are a pissant tactic I’ll agree, but Trump’s famous for using them to avoid paying his contractors so that’s a goose/gander situation.  

Are you asserting that the reporter is “far left” or are you saying it’s possible?  I don’t think you’d be able to say for certain.  Gloria Alred did not work with the reporter, btw.  Alred is prone to cry wolf for sexual harassment/equal opportunity but that’s often a matter of opinion.  Here we’re dealing with accounts of facts. 

Why nothing recent?  Well, he does have a wife now, who is about 14 years younger than him (not a big deal or even suspicious today at his current age, but within the context of the accusations, maybe it is) .  Maybe he decided that was worth not risking it.  Perhaps he decided as he got older that the victims weren’t responding as well as they used too.  Or maybe he had a close call that spooked him a well studied man of law would certainly see where he was headed if he didn’t stop. Who knows?  Maybe we’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.  Maybe he just did it until he found one he wanted to keep.  Point being that not doing it today does not mean he didn’t do it yesterday. 
Brock and Allred offered money to anyone who accused Trump of sexual harassment.  Brock has announced he would pay for dirt, yes, that is correct.  But I'm talking about Brock and Allred offering money together to anyone who would accuse Trump of sexual harassment.

Yes, the "journalists" who broke the story about Moore are far left.  Read any of their Twitter accounts.  

https://mobile.twitter.com/bethreinhard?lang=en

One of the accusers was just caught lying about having no contact with Moore.

http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/11/breaking-accuser-lied-no-contact-roy-moore-alleged-sexual-assault-judge-moore-dismissed-divorce-action/

Also, Allred refused to say that the yearbook "proof" of Moore knowing her was not fraudulent.  See, if she stated that it wasn't fake and it came out that it was she would likely be disbarred.

https://youtu.be/AWRnNEyDwNE

&gt;Here we’re dealing with accounts of facts.

You don't seem to understand what that word means...
How far back should I go?  Two weeks back so far and nothing really partisan on her feed at all. 

Gateway Pundit is not an acceptable source for citing, and their article doesn’t really support their headline.  I had a judge for my divorce.  Never saw him.  Even if I did, i wouldn’t consider it personal 
Interaction.

You’re really grasping for straws on the yearbook.  She’d be disbarred if an investigation turned up she even suggested forging it.  Likely, she’s taking her client’s word for it.  Again, no reason for that woman to make it up.

Yes 
Her entire Twitter is anti-Republican.  There isn't a single story about Uranium One, the DNC contract with Clinton, the Podesta group, or any other huge news that paints the Democrats in a negative light.

The Gateway Pundit story links directly to Moore's attorney who passes out proof to the reporters that Moore and his accuser had contact after the alleged incident, this being what she lied about.

Are you aware that one of the women that has come forth has alleged that Moore simply stood in a way that made her uncomfortable?  That's her beef, that he stood in a way that made her uncomfortable.  How terrible!

Allred was exposed in the wikileaks DNC email dump as being an operative for the DNC.

https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/18961

As someone who claims to be a Conservative Republican, you really are very ignorant to the history of these people that go back decades.  You believe this is all new and these people have no motive behind all the bullshit, but thats your lack of knowledge causing this thinking.  Allred did this same bullshit with Romney, Cain, Trump, and numerous other Republicans.  Read and nform yourself, stop being a stooge for the establishment assholes in both parties 

So I'm watching CNN in my hotel room and you are parroting the talking points from Don Lemons guests; a Democratic Party operative and Gloria fucking Allred.

Are you a paid troll?  Fucking verbatim dude, no way that's a coincidence.  Wtf
Nobody is paying for shit, wish they were.  I don’t watch cable news.  I read WaPo, Fox, NYT, and Washington Examiner.  I peruse drudge links as well, but am always careful to read the articles carefully since he plays loose with headlines.

I suspect that were you to argue any actual points, they’d bear a striking resemblance to some other talking heads.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing.  But the points should be logically sound and valid.  So far with this other dude, his basic premise is a conspiracy theory, and a flimsy one at that.  Some of his points aren’t really true.  I can’t find anything about Allred and some of those candidates like McCain.  

My opinions on this kind of situation are informed by a few things.  First, there’s the number of similar accusations from different victims.  Second, there’s the multitude of non-victims backing up the story as a “known secret.”  Third, there’s my time as a victim advocate in the Marine Corps, where i was trained about it, gave training, and interviewed victims.  Their stories, and his quasi-denials, are exactly like thousands of others.  
Verbatim buddy, I'm not buying it.  This will be my last reply to you and I'm blocking you, I won't deal with trolls or people who are parrots for political operatives.  No way that was just coincidence, it was word for word.

There is literally no useful information in those articles.  And, speaking of parroting, copying links takes even less thought than writing down your thoughts on the matter.  
I want to make something very clear.  None of her stories are “anti-republican”.  Running stories about allegations with on the record sources is neither pro nor con anything.  It’s a story.  As long as all the facts are reported, that’s fair and balanced.  The facts include the allegations, because people are making allegations.  If a story that damages a republican is true, the story is not anti-republican. It’s a true accounting of the facts.  

Secondly, do you think that maybe since Roy Moore is the subject she was assigned to investigate that she might be inclined to focus on Roy Moore?  She’s not a casual consumer of news, she’s a reporter.  She’s still investigating, chasing down leads, double checking for accuracy and validity.  I doubt she has time for other stories right now.  She’s doing her job.

Lastly, while some of your examples of “anti-dem” stories may have weight, Uranium One does not.  It’s a non-story.  Even the Trump appointed attorney general, the honorable Jeff Sessions(R) agrees. There is no reading of the timeline that supports wrong doing.

DNC?  Sure.  Some stuff in there dem groups would really like to know the facts on.  

Podesta?  Sure.  What’s the less famous Podesta doing to get looked at by a special prosecutor?  Love to know, but Mueller runs a tight ship.  We’ll find out when he wants us to.  If a prosecutor gets to witnesses before the press, he may very well order them to not speak to press about it. 

For all of them, hard to write stories without new info.  The Post may very well have a legion of reporters looking at all of them,  but with little new dat comes little to wrote about.

For an example, if you remember when Don Jr tweeted out that he had met with russians to get dirt on hillary, you may remember the internet laughing at a reporter.  This guy had been working on that story for a year, but no one heard about it until Don Jr tweeted it.  That reporter didn’t hear something sketchy and immediately run 500 words on it, he started doing the work to investigate and verify. It took year just for him to get scooped by his subject. 
I can't believe I just found this on the Republican sub. Wow. Didn't expect that.
Good read. It makes perfect sense and it's from an educational source.

3 million illegal immigrants voting 
Refreshing that no one in /r/politics is standing up for him. Good to see some integrity when it comes to dealing with the bad apple
Name calling doesn't add much to the credibility your argument.
It might be worth saying what specifically you disagree with?
Personal opinion? 
Or something you can substantiate?
I don't get how he thought "yup this is a great idea given my social status and political agenda"
this was 3 years before he even became a Senator
you don't think he had preconceived notions to run for senator?
And you know exactly what was going on in his head 2 years before he even had to start campaigning?
this is like saying someone in 2 years decides to want to be a doctor. Pretty sure no 30 something year old up-and-decides "today I am going to be a doctor." But lets say he didn't. If you are going to run for any office, you best be sure to clean up your tracks- dirty or not. 
Nothing to see here, folks. Move along.

* she's donated a lot to Democrats
* she wasn't a registered Republican by the time of the primary and couldn't vote for her father
* she believes in forcing companies to provide paid maternal leave
* she believes in the gender wage gay myth 


Sources on your bullet points? And the snopes article never said that ivanka was either a democrat or a Republican. And the 2nd article is just saying that ivanka has a similar viewpoint to hillary on 1 topic. That doesn't make ivanka a democrat. I agreed with trump on increasing veteran care, but that doesn't automatically make me a Republican
She supports positions that Democrats support. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck...
No one wants to mess with you, ugly bimbo
And what are your sources for that claim and the claims about her you made in your previous post?
Lol
Always happens the same way
I think Ben Shapiro made a comment on Out Numbered confirming this statement..
Dude is such a clown. Taunting against the person you beat a year ago? Like come on man
It's actually smart. He had beaten her one he'll beat her again. Just hope the DNC isn't stupid enough to go for it
They aren't..... maybe. DNC should have Biden to run but at this point who knows.
She just questioned the legitimacy of the election, so Trump can burn her publicly for all I care.
&gt;Fox News employs numerous liberal democrats

Ok. The object of your sentence is plural so, please name two. 

&gt;I'm sure you could....

This is how you begin stating an assumption, not a fact. 

&gt;I'm sure you could find several people who work for Fox News that would prefer no one would talk about the Uranium One scandal.

If your assumption is it is so easy to prove, why aren't you pointing them out to me? You can't tell me I am wrong then make it my responsibility to prove your point. That's not how a debate works. 
Politics aside, I'm not sure I know what thing he has done to help or hurt employment.
[removed]
It's a little more than a year since Trump was saying that the government's employment figures were "fake." Also, your average right-leaning radio/tv host was spouting that it was the labor participation rate that mattered and the unemployment numbers were doctored.
I don't think that anyone thought they were "doctored" (well, anyone other than Alex jones), but rather that unemployment numbers might not be the most accurate, because it doesn't take non-seekers into account...BUT they have been saying this for the past two decades also, so..
Well, I give Hannity a listen for about 15 minutes a day. Prior to the election, yes, all economic data was fake and doctored. He'd go on a rant that I could recite along with him (because he basically recites the same talking points every day).

Unemployment data is fake.

Labor participation rate is the lowest since 1950.

Home-ownership is at its lowest levels in 40 years.

etc. etc. etc.

Basically, any good economic data since the "Obama Recession" started is fake.

The fact that he called the crash the "Obama Recession" is another testament to how disingenuous he can be. 
Deregulation.

https://www.google.com/amp/thehill.com/opinion/white-house/360456-credit-trump-for-boosting-business-and-fueling-our-economic-growth%3famp


https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_8974_us_unemployment_rate_n.jpg

Can't really see where this 'deregulation' has kicked in. Can you?
Being on a Republican sub I apparently took for granted how easy the linked article was to understand.  What is it that you are having trouble understanding and we can go from there?
Being a Republican, I fail to see how you answered the question about helping or hurting employment.

To be fair the linked opinion piece is fairly biased, the writer was up for the U.S. Labor Secretary job by Trump before having to withdrawl due to outcry from across the board, including many Republicans.

&gt;Andy Puzder is a policy adviser to America First Policies. He was chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants for more than 16 years, following a career as an attorney. He was nominated by President Trump to serve as U.S. labor secretary. 

The article also does not detail how this new de-regulated economy is any better than the previous one, the economy is still going up at roughly the same rate as before. All it states is that there is less regulations
Well, I linked an article that details how deregulation under Trump has drastically increased economic optimism and expansion.  Within that article there are links to the Small Business Optimism Index and the Consumer Confidence Index that detail how business and consumer optimism has drastically increased since Trump was elected.

Increased small business optimism means expansion and investment, that leads to more jobs.  Increased consumer confidence means more Americans spending money, this leads to economic expansion and more jobs.  

Your issue doesn't seem to be with me, it's your laziness to actually read what has been put in front of you.  
https://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/7e2qwq/magic_wand_trump_brings_jobs_back_to_america/dq3liiy/
The article uses trucks and optimism to claim that the economy is blowing up.... That is not evidence of an increased economy, that is hopes and a few trucks, the US economy is far larger than that. Hard numbers are needed and then compared against what the economy was doing before Trump came to power to see the difference. 

It is generally known that the first year of a presidency has little to do with the new president as the economy is still running off the old governments polices.


&gt; Basically, any good economic data since the "Obama Recession" started is fake.

Someone should tell the Dow Jones Index that. 
"Optimism" is great, but this optimism has not translated into any kind of measurable change in the employment rate. The downward trend of the unemployment rate has been fairly constant. Trump's policies have yet to have an effect on the economic numbers that he called "fake" and "phony" just a year ago.
In the conservative media world, the booming stock market only started to count for something on January 20, 2017.

&gt; “We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what’s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.”
&gt; 
&gt; ~ Trump's Presidential announcement speech, June 16, 2015


I just look at the market and regardless of who is in charge, the Dow has been a straight line for almost a decade (since the collapse of 08). It didn't magically get better..or worse. Industry leaders stood next to trump, then turned on him, but nothing really changed. Just a lot of yelling IMHO.
Your lack of knowledge on what these indexes are is the issue.  Businesses and our own Government use these indexes to forecast growth, invest in new infrastructure and hiring, as well as production.

When two parties have come together to discuss a topic and one is too lazy and ignorant to learn so they may have an understanding, it makes no sense to continue the discussion.

Rather than be an ignorant troll, perhaps you should take the time to learn and hopefully stop making yourself look like an idiot.
Since you and the other moron want to remain ignorant, I'll spend no more time on you than I already have on him.

https://www.reddit.com/r/republicans/comments/7e2qwq/magic_wand_trump_brings_jobs_back_to_america/dq46xpl/
"moron", "idiot", "troll" ... Why do you have such trouble sticking to the topic being discussed?
Well, you ask a question and then I answer it using two economic indicators that show a direct effect of Trumps policies and you refuse to read them and just respond with idiotic responses.

You're a lazy idiot and you're obviously a troll because your post history is nothing more than you talking shit about Conservatives.  This being the most hilarious of it all.  An idiot attempting to make jokes about people who are vastly more informed than them.
Yes, I asked a question. Your response did not address the question. The name calling thing is very juvenile though. And post history? That's a little creepy and stalkerish to be looking at that. But go ahead. I stand by everything. I haven't looked at your post history, because it doesn't have anything to do with the topic at hand. Nor does calling people names.

So hide behind your anger and mock outrage. Have a great day.
That's what's infuriating.  My response has everything to do with it.  The indexes state that the upswing happened the moment Trump was elected.  All you would have to do is actually read it, but you won't so you will remain voluntarily ignorant.  Sad😕
OP was talking about unemployment.

They do not use optimism and truck sales to forecast growth, they use economic growth and economic numbers. 

Not "optimism" and good wishes. 

Will end the discussion there as you are unable to discuss in a decent manner. Grow up.

And if you actually read what those indexes are you would know you are continuing to make an ass of yourself.
The rate patterns on employment hasn't changed since the election. The only thing that's changed is how the right-wing media addresses in the employment numbers. That used to be fake, now they're not. That's dishonest, disingenuous and an outright lie.
Businesses, banks, and our government actually do use those indexes to forecast growth, investment in infrastructure, and hiring.

You didn't read anything and yet you still comment while being ignorant.  I will never understand why someone would be happy to remain ignorant, yet here you are.
Good
Is your blog satire?
I'm afraid not... 
Still confounded how anyone can think Trump has “American values”.  He doesn’t even have Republican values, let alone American. 
This reads like the blog author ran out of their medication...

Doesn't even have an American wife
&gt; \1. Rejection of free speech.  

You are rejecting their right to complain.  Isn't that rejection of Free Speech also?  Let's not be hypocrites here.

&gt; \2. Rejection of U.S. history.  

I haven't seen any hatred of history.  This accusation has no proof.  Please provide some proof to support this claim, otherwise you are exacerbating the divide issue in our country over an opinion you have stated as fact.

&gt; \3. Belief in discrimination in the guise of equality.  

You mean like kicking out all Muslims as terrorists?  Isn't that discrimination?  Or are you arguing that discrimination to help minorities groups is bad discrimination?  Which I would definitely be willing to listen to arguments of the ills of positive discrimination.

&gt; \4. Belief in entitlements

This can easily be re-written to say, "Belief in having a fair chance."  Entitlements is so poorly defined that you can attach it to any reasonable request to make it sound unreasonable.

You claim that all these "entitlements" are sought to avoid taking responsibility, but that argument can be flipped:

You refuse to grant a fair chance to everyone else because you wish to avoid taking responsibility for your own impact on and weighing down of society.  You forget that you are not a lone individual succeeding in a war where selfishness rules.  You are part of a nation of people who have to work together to keep the nation together and healthy.  You need to face THAT responsibility.

&gt; \5. Rejection of natural human sexuality.

Your definition of "natural human sexuality" seems to miss that homosexuality is a naturally produced, not manufactured, form of sexuality.  Check your Republican neighbors who have argued against gay rights, only to be found in homosexual liaisons themselves.  

Why would they argue against it if they embraced it?  They wouldn't.  

If they fought being gay, why was it so difficult that they still succumbed to it?  Because it isn't a choice.

&gt; \6. Belief in murder

     Do you eat?  You murderer.  You have to murder a cow, a pig, a carrot, a head of lettuce, just to survive.  You murdering hypocrite.

Murder is bad.  But let's not make it out to be worse than it is.  And let's not make out like we're all innocent of it.

I'm not sure where your other arguments are going, because they are based on the idea that all killing is bad (which is obviously not what you believe because you're alive to type this blog).  So let's get past that little hypocrisy and move to the real root.  What is it you are really taking offense at here?


&gt; \7. Vehemently anti- (the Judaeo-Christian) God. 

That would be extreme atheists or anti-theists, not liberals.  You are making a connection where none exists.  There are very religious liberals, and very anti-religious liberals.  It might surprise you that there are even very anti-religious Republicans and conservatives.

&gt; \8. Rejection of, and thus lack of respect for, private property and its owners.

Your statement and your argument don't match up.  I think you believe there is a connection here, but it must all be in your head.  Yes, many liberals seem to believe in heavy protections, which you oppose.  I agree that even protections need their opposing force.

But how does that correlate to a lack of respect for private property?

Isn't toxic dumping upstream of housing that relies on that very stream a disrespect for private property?  That's what these regulations are protecting.  So your argument that they disrespect private property doesn't hold from your argument against heavy regulation.
 
&gt; \9. Favor heavy taxation. 

Ah.  Here I see another hypocrisy.  Taxing the inordinately wealthy and the tax avoiding corporations to support the rest of the nation seems to be their goal.  But you have misrepresented it by claiming they wish to tax the "working class".

What do the tax cuts that have been brought to congress have in common lately?  Tax cuts for the very wealthy, at the cost of "entitlements" called healthcare costs for the less than very wealthy.  Doesn't that seem like uneven distribution?  I can tell you, the cost burden these cuts put on the middle and lower classes are far greater than they remove from the upper classes (who can actually handle more taxes without fear of poverty in any way).

&gt; \10. Love being victims.

This only makes you sound like a bully.  If someone needs help, they're a victim.  If they have an issue, they are only faking it.  Is it no wonder they don't listen to you?  You don't listen to them!  

Would anyone help you if you were suddenly left broke on the side of the road?  Not if they act like you do.

I thought the golden rule was treat others the way you wish to be treated, not treat others poorly because they are a hardship to you.

&gt; \11. Make other nation’s goals more important than America’s.

I think you have misrepresented the nations goals, and liberals' goals here.  You believe that any goal that doesn't align with yours is anti-American.  Therefore any goal you disagree with is akin to terrorism.  Were you faced with your own argument later, you would patently reject it because it is both absurd and unsupported.

&gt; \12. Lastly, and I could have made this the one and only trait as it encompasses all the traits preceding: They hate President Trump.

Hmmm.  I think a lot of people hate Trump.  Republican, Democrats, Liberals, Conservatives, and anyone else he has stomped on.  Ask the Scottish.  They probably hate Trump.  He hasn't made friends of many.

But does that matter?  He made his bed, and must lay in it, just like the rest of us.

If you wish to argue, I love having counter points.  It is the best way to evaluate views and come to better conclusions.  But this tripe you are trying to pass off as factual is entirely an opinion piece, meant to rile up your readers in an unfounded hatred of their fellow countrymen.  If I were as absurd as you, I'd call you a terrorist.  But I understand that you are simply a person who doesn't verify their information, argues from feelings and refuses to reflect on the results of their actions.  You are the kind of person whom could learn a lot from self-reflection.  Stop avoiding your responsibility to the nation.  Use your voice to help the world find a better solution, not divide it against itself.  Because that is all you are doing here:  Dividing YOUR nation.  You are helping no one.

I am not a liberal or a conservative, or a Republican or a Democrat.  I am an American looking to make America a place where everyone wants to live.  And I believe you are tearing my nation apart.

You and the other "party liners" out there that thrive on division and argument are not helping the people who actually live there.  You are massaging your egos with rhetoric that has been fed to you, that tells you it's okay to treat people like crap.

If that's what you believe, perhaps people should treat you exactly as you treat them.

Learn the golden rule.  Use it to make the world better.
That’s unnecessary and not really a valid criticism. 
Uhm... okay?

Edit: like seriously... wtf does that have to do with anything 
You are the hero the US need!
The fact they're still talking about Clinton means they're fuuuuuuucked

I don't know the laws on that in NY. most states have decided that to be legal.  It's a states rights issue is what I'm saying.

This blog has to be satire right?
I am not a Christian but an Atheist. I find abortion morally abhorrent and I understand the sentiment of this article. But there are some simple facts here.

No matter what I believe, think or say. Woman are going to get abortions you can't stop it. You could legislate it, condemn it, put scarlet letters on them whatever. The simple truth is they will find a way. 

The only pragmatic thing to do is to regulate it, make it safe and listen to the women doing it. 
Babies are not an ethnic group. 
Leftists will freak out about a gun death stat that is a minuscule amount compared to this  and is mostly suicides, but as soon as you bring up 500k dead babies a year they no longer care about loss of life. 
&gt; Woman are going to get abortions you can't stop it. You could legislate it, condemn it, put scarlet letters on them whatever. The simple truth is they will find a way. 

This is simply an absurd belief and idea.

If this is the case, then why have laws at all, since they will prevent no crime from being committed?
Black babies are. They are disproportionately being exterminated.
Rules are for the guidance of the wise and the obedience of fools 
Extermination is usually something we do to pests, not humans. Perhaps its your views that should be evaluated or changed in this regard.
I suppose the same could be said about rape, it is going to happen no matter what, so why not put regulation on it, make everyone use protection and get screened for vd.....we don't do this because regulating any abuse or murder on another still results in a victim who has been raped or murdered. Abortion is widely accepted, much like slavery was, at what point do we recognise everyone's human rights and put our convictions over our convenience. I know that woman struggle greatly before and after they have an abortion and that many woman are not financially or mentally ready for a child, but how does that justify murder?
Genocide- the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation.
The definition holds unless there is a loop hole where you can kill a large group just because we don't know there ethnicity or nationality. The Jewish are a religious group, any ethnicity or nationality can choose to be Jewish and yet that fact that they are not always your stereotypical light skinned Israelite, they were "exterminated" like pests as well. It's a diversion when all you do is argue semantics pertaining to the hook of the article or the use of the appropriate term 'exterminate'. And the fact that we exterminate pests not humans is a perfect example of why this needs to stop, you have acknowledged them as human, so why do they have no right to life?
&gt; I suppose the same could be said about rape

You *could* suppose that. You'd be wrong to do so, but if you want to, go ahead.
Thanks for copy pasting something I know by memory and work with on a constant basis in historical context, really informative. 

So, to extrapolate on your point, lets see which category babies fall into. "Large group of people", well, the only thing unifying babies in this context is their age. This would fall under ageism, but since babies are not trying to defend themselves publicly I'd say this is incorrect and they are not a "large group". Groups usually have something identifying themselves, and they usually have a position in which they would defend their rights or what have you. "Ethnic group", well, ethnicity usually has something to do with heritage, and since its just babies being targeted, again, its an age thing, not ethnicity. "Nation", well, since this is America, we can perhaps take on this supposiiton, but  quickly negate it with the fact that Americans would be "exterminating" Americans, and not targeting solely blacks or some "race" qualifier. 

&gt;The Jewish are a religious group, any ethnicity or nationality can choose to be Jewish 

Yes, they are religious. Indeed. But did you know that being Jewish is also traced matrilineally? You dont "choose" to be Jewish, you either are Jewish, or you are a convert. And yes, they were also "exterminated", as I said, the terminology should probably be reevaluated as humans are not pests. 

&gt; It's a diversion when all you do is argue semantics pertaining to the hook of the article or the use of the appropriate term 'exterminate'.

Actually my main point was rebuking the term genocide. If semantics bother you, I suggest learning the right words. We didnt create languages and master the art of rhetoric to simple muddy the waters when we dont know how to express certain beliefs. 

&gt;you have acknowledged them as human, so why do they have no right to life?

What about the mothers rights? What about the right to not be forced to carry a baby that will die or cause the mother to die? What about rape babies? What about incest babies? A woman is a human life, she has rights before you can claim to protect the thing she is growing inside of her. If you believe you can violate ones rights to protect another's rights, you need to apply that outside of abortion and see just how wrong that perspective is. 
500'000 people under the age of 40 weeks gestation are systematically killed, but because they are not defending themselves publicly they are not a large group? Are they now less than 500'000 people within a specific parameter based on age? They need to be a specific color or nationality otherwise they can't be victims? In Germany, they exterminated (killing, especially of a whole group of people or animals) German Jews and in Paris they exterminated Parisian Jews, all Jews, based on their practiced religion, not on their matrilineally traced heritage. Maybe you should focus on the definition of terminology used and not your personal perception of it. You might remember from your constant work with historical context that many historical and current accounts of the Holocaust refer to the mass killing of Jews as extermination and if you are so offended by that terminology being used referring to this unqualified large group of humans then why aren't you offended by their execution. I understand that an age group that can't defend themselves doesn't qualify in your book to have right
Correct. Therefore the term genocide is inappropriate for this discussion. Also, I'd appreciate cited sources of 500'000 babies being aborted every year, please. Also, systematically is also incorrect. You make it seem like there is a program with the intent of murdering babies, which is not the case. Abortion is a person to person matter, not one of policy. Again, genocide is the incorrect term.
...rights, but doesn't that suggest that it is their inability to defend themselves that makes them a specific group, other than their age. They are the people who need defending the most and you think that they are not worthy if they can't defend themselves. The mother has rights and choices, the choice to use contraception or utilize the adoption industry, or maybe take some responsibility. She should not have the right take another humans life, even if they are not a specific race or nationality. Less than 0.5% of abortions are due to rape, less than 4% are due to risk of the mothers life, so how can we set a standard based on such a small percentage abortion seekers. Other countries have set specific parameters to allow abortion for those cases, so why is America so set on all inclusivity.  If a woman is going to die in child birth then she should have the right to her life, anything beyond that does not justify the right to kill. Not being pregnant t and giving  birth is not a right. And statistically incest is included with rape? Maybe you should learn the right words so you don't muddy the waters with your overreach....rape, imminent death...that's it, less than 5% justified, though I don't think that the horrible circumstance of rape exactly justifies murdering someone else and impeding on their right to life. I wish we could have had a more kind and less condescending tone, would have been a more productive debate. God Bless
I apologise, you are right, I was looking at an older statistic, the more recent one is from the Family Research Council in 2014 926,200... 323,999 of them were committed by Planned Parenthood. Genocide is the deliberate killing of a large group of people, which large group of people is semantics and if you want to argue that it is ok to kill anyone, even someone who can't defend themselves publicly then you might want to apply that logic outside of abortion and see just how wrong that perspective is. And there is a program for murdering babies, it's called the abortion industry, it is carried out on a person to person basis. Whether something is policy or option, both can be corrupt and the abortion industry is systematic...they methodically murder babies...that's all they do is carry out a fixed system to kill babies.
Again, genocide is not the correct term for this discussion. All of your points have been hammered away at since the early 70's and yet still we have Roe v Wade's decision. Women have the right to access abortions without the threat of death, period. I suggest finding a new path to push your religious agenda. Perhaps you should start having your church pay taxes if you wish to influence politics further. That, or keep your fairy tales out of my politics which govern my quality of life based on logic, not superstitions. 

&gt;Maybe you should learn the right words so you don't muddy the waters with your overreach....

How cute. You then say, 

&gt;I wish we could have had a more kind and less condescending tone

Well, it looks like you missed the exit for the high road back there when you decided to copy paste a definition that I clearly refuted. 
Does abortion meet genocide qualifications?

1: is it a race, ethnic group or religion? 

*No*

2: is it a gov't policy with specific intent to remove or kill said poeple?

*No*

It is not genocide. 
This conversation is over. Abortion is not genocide.
I am sorry that you couldn't debate anything beyond the sarcastic first line, regulating wrong doing does not justify it. I guess if you are going to commit a crime anyway we might as well make it all legal. People are going to abuse their children, should we allow it and just regulate the abuse? To suggest that it is ok to step out of the bounds of morality just because a bunch of people are doing it is a very slippery slope. Slavery was regulated and no matter what, those victims were gonna be victimised, yet it wasn't until someone recognised those people as people and recognised their human rights that they were fought for. Pragmatism can not replace morality, that is a scary suggestion.
I am sorry you are so angry, you are in my prayers, God Bless
LOL. The best religious cop out of all time, "prayer". Gimme a break. Facts are not emotions. Just because you have nothing valid to respond with does not negate that you are wrong. 
That was sarcasm?!?


I honestly agree with you but laws like this don’t work. That’s the simple truth. It’s been tried over and over again. 

Women always find a way out of desperation 
I have never read something so ignorant. Lets have a go with these "traits".

1: Rejection of free speech

*Rejecting specific speech, is not a rejection of all speech. This is a non sequiter fallacy.*

2: Rejection of U.S. history

*Gonna have to call some serious bullshit here. As a professional who works in the field of history, most liberals attempt to rectify history with contemporary studies. No liberal destroys history, as you so put it.*

3: Belief in discrimination in the guise of equality.

*I dont know how raising one up to be equal as another is discrimination. When one has a higher station in life and others are raised to this similar standard, that is not racism against the one who already had a high station. That's also a fallacy.*

4: Belief in entitlements.

*Lets get into the details of this one, because the title is misleading. You say liberals have a "Rejection of personal responsibility and accountability, as well as their lack of historical study", again, complete bullshit. Liberalism/Humanism was founded by ancient Greek philosophers. Secondly, if liberals had no personal accountability... like really? What kind of fantasy world do you live in? Thats utter bullshit.*

5: Rejection of natural human sexuality.

*Sexuality is a personal choice. There is a naturalization of procreation, but other than that you're stretching what is "natural". And since plenty of animals in the wild kingdom are also gay, perhaps it is you who rejects nature.*

6: Belief in murder.

*Abortion? Really? Dead horse, cant beat it any further.* 

7: Vehemently anti- (the Judaeo-Christian) God

*Faith is a personal matter. Does one have to believe in your god to be a decent person? No. They dont. And since they have people like you shoving your religion down thier throats perhaps you should dial back your proselytizing so much they might not be so vehemently against it. Live and let live, perhaps?*

8: Rejection of, and thus lack of respect for, private property and its owners.

*People can not agree with rich people owning all the land. Whats wrong with that? I live in an area with a very beautiful river that I will never be allowed to fish because its all private property? Does that make me a bad person for not respecting rich people who control where I can and cannot go?*

9: Favor heavy taxation.

You quickly say, "unlike most working Americans", so I'm gonna move on to the next one because right there you say liberals dont work. Either they do or they dont. You cant have both. 

10: Love being victims.

*Standing up for equality is not being a victim and individuals can achieve in group settings. Just because they work with others does not negate thier efforts to improve other peoples lives. Something something, selflessness, something something the bible. Read it, dont just repeat it.* 

11: Make other nation’s goals more important than America’s

*As a freedom loving American who was raised on the concepts of all people are created equal, I see no qualms in spreading the love of all men to all men, no matter their country of origin, or their religion, or their skin color. I only see one problem in this section, and thats you equate others goals as anti American when America has nothing to do with setting personal goals. Many liberals have served this country because of their love for people and country. This point is null.*

12: Lastly, and I could have made this the one and only trait as it encompasses all the traits preceding: They hate President Trump.

*This is not an arguing point. Liberalism, which embraces the aspects of equality and everything that it would influence, of course do not like a bigoted, misogynistic, entitled brat, draft dodging, scamming rich asshole as a leader. Pretty obvious. But unfortunately those who do not like Trump are not limited to "liberals", as many others also do not like him. When you're an asshole who has ripped off people for a living, people not liking is just part of the gig.*


Is this article claiming that they are?
The article is making the claim that abortion is genocide. Genocide has a very specific set of parameters to be called genocide. I know semantics isnt everyones favorite game, but when dealing with intentionally murder of peoples it is not taken lightly, and words matter very much because of law. Abortion is not genocide, as the author makes the claim. My pointing out they are not an ethnic group stems from one of the basic parameters of meeting the definition of genocide.
Fair point.
Black babies belong to a race.

It is government policy to kill them. Until we ban abortion, that is.

It is genocide. That is what Sanger wanted: A pure white race with all of the "less desirables" culled from the population.

You cannot deny this because it is what is happening today.
Then we need laws against abortion.
Can you explain to me your perspective more? Why do you feel a law is the only answer? 
No, it is not a policy. The govt does not force people into abortions. 

It is not genocide, no matter if you say so or not. There are requirements to meet genocide because it is a crime clearly defined by laws. 

You cannot say something is just because you say it is. Thats not how reality works. 
Get eeeemmmm

I calls em as I sees em. ;) 
Abortion is government policy. The tolerance of abortion, even the funding of it, is all something the government chose to do, thus policy.

It is genocide because it is disproportionately targeted to black populations. Look it up. They are dying in greater proportion than in white, asian, even hispanics.

I can state facts; you are free to accept or reject them. You can find evidence that corroborates or contradicts them if you are so inclined. As it is, the evidence is readily available.
Why have laws at all? The answer is rather simple.

Your answer, or rather, your argument why you shouldn't have laws, was: You can't stop bad behavior, so why try?

My assertion is this. One, the government exists solely for the purpose of protecting rights. Two, the government writes and enforces laws for this end.

Thus, we should consider a law on its own merits as to whether or not it would enable government to protect rights or hinder it, as well as the common citizen.

Do unborn children have a right to life? I say they do, and I will fight to the death if need be to maintain that assertion. God gave us the right to life, and that means all who would take it need to be stopped, by government, if necessary.

Thus, we need laws forbidding abortion and punishing those who do so anyway.

Will it stop abortions? No, that is not the effect of laws. It doesn't stop bad behavior, but it does enable government to suppress bad behavior. With such a law, we can shut down hospitals and clinics that provide abortions, revoke the licenses of doctors that do so and fine or imprison those who get, perform, or assist in the procedure. That will certainly add a significant cost to abortions.

Those who really, really want one can still get one, either by getting it on the black market or by doing it dangerously. It's the same as drug laws: You don't write drug laws thinking it will end drug abuse, but you write it so that government and the people are enabled to protect one right or the other (in this case, the right to not be addicted to drugs.)

Viewed this way, here's what I think a reasonable law would look like:

1. No abortions, with certain exceptions. If you perform, receive, or participate in an illegal abortion, you can get fined or punished in one way or the other, among the punishments revoking your medical license or shutting down the hospital or clinic. (This pushes all abortions underground.) Exceptions would include only the life of the mother, and then, you'd need a court order, after a trial by jury condemning the fetus to death. (Everyone is entitled to due process, even the unborn.)

2. If you can manage to do the abortion secretly and safely underground without a court order, then who knows and who cares? Congratulations, you've just taken a life without anyone who cares about that life knowing. People do this all the time with other crimes. Live out the rest of your days with the internal guilt and shame. If something goes wrong, however, you can bet your life that the people who were injured are going to exact justice from you.

The law is simple and clear, and it deters people from injuring the rights of the unborn, while respecting other rights.
Although I don’t agree you make compelling points. They are well thought out and logical. 

How do you feel about spirit of laws vs literalism? 

Do you think everyone should obey the authority? 


If aborting black babies is a government policy of genocidal intent you need to prove it. You dont make claims and say “go find it yourself, its true”. Thats not how things work. You made the claim, you need to provide the evidence. And if you dont provide the evidence and yet still reply, dont expect another response from me. I have argued and studied the definition of genocide in the context of the Armenian genocide and I will not continue to repeat myself.

honestly let women do what they want w their bodies?
nice B)
You people are fucking idiots.  
Voted on and passed without a single person reading it. Brilliant.
Yeah right, who wants to keep more of their money!?!  Just a bunch of idiots working hard and wanting to keep more of the money they earn.  What's next from these scoundrels, reducing regulations that in turn will lower the costs of goods and services.  Oh the horror!
Republicans read it.  Democrats don't read Bill's before they vote anyways, see Obamacare, so it's not like we are at a loss here.
Tldr?
?
What is the article about?
It is my take on the presidential campaign. It's a bit past it's time at this point, I just started publishing. Have a great day, God Bless
Democrat doom and gloom about hurting the poor is BS, but the Republican “it’ll pay for itself with growth” line is also BS.  
TLDR: "I listen to AM radio and can recite what they say."
The "Silent Majority" exists because the left denigrates and abuses anyone that dares express a viewpoint outside the realm of acceptable leftist groupthink.

Post anything even marginally pro-Trump or pro-Conservative on Facebook or Twitter and you'll be called a racist and a bigot.  

Essentially, social media has become an echo chamber for leftist thought, leading many to believe that pro-Hillary and pro-Leftist support was much larger than it really is, because opposing viewpoints just aren't shared there anymore.
I don't think anyone is making the case that "it will pay for itself".  People literally just don't care about deficits.  They don't matter when discussing spending bills; they shouldn't matter when discussing tax cuts either.  The *entire* Republican philosophy is based on *reducing* the amount of money that goes to D.C.  

That being said, there's a bit of a smoke and mirrors game with the growth estimates to sneak past the "revenue-neutral" budgetary rules, but I don't think anyone *really* believes that.  It's not even a talking point being used by Republicans.  Hell, Rand Paul is openly saying that this tax cut is *not* revenue neutral.
Republicans did not read it, it was released 2 hours prior to a vote. A select few created it, and only they knew what was in it. Nobody read it in full, didn't even have time to actually type out all the changes, written in pen. 

If you did not have time to type it up, then you did not have time to actually think about the changes. 

&gt; so it's not like we are at a loss here.

This is the most significant change to the tax code in 30 years..... yeah, not important at all
Without trying to be a dick here I think it's safe to assume you are not a Republican?  I ask because it's normally only Democrats and far left liberals who don't know how our government actually works.

The Senate passed its version of the tax bill, the House has passed their version.  Now members of both chambers will meet in committee to hash out all of the details for a final tax Bill that both the House and Senate will vote on.

So until that final Bill is passed, nothing significant will change.  My suggestion is that you stop reading fake news that is telling you that poor people will die and the rich will smoke cigars and put their ashes out on minorities.  

You should also ask yourself why the Democratic Party doesn't want you to have more of the money you work for, unless you don't work then I guess it really doesn't matter.
I am non-partisan. Both sides are full of shit. Last I checked bills were not written in pen!!!

This should be a nonpartisan thing but for some god damn reason it is. 

This presidency was supposed to be about change and not having the same shit continue. 

My suggestion to you is to stop playing sides and see what is happening with this. Bills written with pen and voted on without anyone reading it should not be acceptable regardless of what sides does it. 
Our Constitution was written in pen ink.  Presidents sign Bills into law with a set of pens.

The Republican Party has been working on this Bill for the past 9 years and it is based on Republican ideology.  They know exactly what is in that Bill.
&gt; People literally just don't care about deficits. 

It seems like it’s a huge issue when the President is a Democrat. 
&gt; it is based on Republican ideology. 

Expanding the deficit? Making personal tax cuts temporary and business tax cuts permanent? That ideology?
&gt;Our Constitution was written in pen ink
&gt;Presidents sign Bills into law with a set of pens.

It is 2017, not 1787, and presidents sign the document in pen, they do not write it.

&gt;Bill for the past 9 years

No they have not. This is only a few months/weeks in the making. The Republicans clearly stated that it was only written a little while ago. If in fact it had been in the works for a long time, no entry would be written in pen on the margins of a page. It was a rush job. Ramming it through before Christmas to win some political points. 

&gt; They know exactly what is in that Bill.

The simple fact is that most people had zero chance to read it. 400+ pages released and only 2 hours to read, digest, and analyze. How can you even analyze something written

The economy is far to important to be a rush job. Screw it up and it will have lasting consequences, and last I checked, a major deficit increase with no plans to get it under control is not Republican ideology. Republican ideology would be to cut first and then submit a budget that is either debt neutral or god forbid would result in the debt being paid back.

Not a fan of it, unless here is something that I don't know about the case.
Part of my problem with it is that it looks like nobody believes it will spur that much growth.  If it did, the income tax cuts wouldn’t revert. If the Republicans use fiscal complaints when the Dems try to spend, they should stick to their guns on it when they run the show.  I’m definitely not a fan of the, “if they fudge it so can we” mentality.
The required growth to support the claim that it will offset the deficit is something that the US has never experienced. Not even during the roaring 30's did they reach the growth required to support this bill. 

It is based on fantasy. 
I've already explained how our government works to another redditor on this thread, you should take the time to read it.

House Republicans are working on reducing the deficit that the Bill would cause.  That's why the Bill's are going to conference.

Please stop posting idiotic comments if you don't even understand the procedures.
With regards to number 4 (and by extension, everything else), these things exist because people wanted them. While it's possible for everyone to get some of what they want, we're increasingly acting as though fair representation is a zero-sum game: For me to win, you must lose and place your neck beneath my heel.

&gt;Gimmie my National Conceal Carry Reciprocity, and give up your Medica.

&gt;Gimmie my free college, and give up your all your guns.

&gt;Gimmie my gay marriage, and give up your religious safe-harbor.

&gt;Gimmie me full rights to discriminate, give up your rights to associate.

The line dividing us is thick enough that they could be two legitimate nations, each with oppressive ideological doctrine, and both on the brink of thermonuclear war.
I agree that the lack of compromise or seeing the other side is a big factor in our issues.

I don’t see the division where you drew the lines, but these are definitely all issues people have refused to compromise either direction on.

We’re all part of the same nation, and should work to find solutions that work for most everyone.

College could be free, if the early levels were based on practical application like trade schools, where you work for the field while you learn.

Guns could be better controlled if everyone had to receive training in school and serve their country for at least a year.  Everyone could use self-defense lessons.  But that would require trusting your government.

Religion shouldn’t push itself on people who disagree, but they should have placed that are for religious purposes only, that they can decide who can and can’t go.  These places can not interfere with commercial practices, though.  No religious corporations or politics.
&gt;House Republicans are working on reducing the deficit that the Bill would cause

That is not how responsible finance works. Cut first, then you cut the taxes. That is how responsible finance is done. You do not cut taxes first and then figure out how to pay for it later, that is how a child does finance. 

Racing to ruin the US economy. Even the top tax rep for Bush is bashing this bill and saying it is a piece of shit. 

Republican's failed on this, stop posting idiotic defenses of it. 
&gt;and then figure out how to pay for it later

Tax cuts aren't paid for.  That money isn't the government's, it's the taxpayers money.  

&gt;Even the top tax rep for Bush

Is that supposed to mean something?  Bush was a disaster for the debt and deficit.  Are you awaiting the response of Obama's economic team as well?

They haven't passed a final Bill yet so how have they failed you fucking moron?  They have moved the Bill to conference to try and make it deficit neutral, once they do their best and agree on the Bill then they will pass it and it can be judged as a win or a fail.

You're an idiot, and your comments are moronic and ignorant.  


I don't imagine that you plan on running for office any time soon? Don't feel bad, neither do I. The ones who gravitate towards these positions though, are the worst possible people for the job.
Power attracts those who want power, not those who want to make the world a better place for everyone.  Perhaps there is a way we can make the position less appetizing to those with poor intentions?
&gt;Tax cuts aren't paid for. That money isn't the government's, it's the taxpayers money.

"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's" --- yeah, that money is the governments. Do not believe me? then go and get it.

You mean like all your net neutrality comments you had to go through and delete? 
I haven't deleted anything.  Great detective work there genius.
I was unaware we lived under Roman rule in America.  So who's Cesar?

I don't know how many times I have to say it before the point lands with you, but no final Bill has passed and nothing has changed.  The Bill is in conference because the Senate passed their Bill and the House passed theirs.  Now they will debate the final Bill and it will either pass or it won't.

That is such a ridiculously easy to understand truth that only a fucking moron wouldn't understand it.  They've changed nothing.
They don't want to comment. They just want to keep their majority in the Senate so that they can pass the tax cuts their donors demand. They don't care who they have to endorse to achieve that. There's literally no other motivation or explanation.
&gt;I was unaware we lived under Roman rule in America. So who's Cesar?

It is from the bible, was reference to people paying taxes and if they were approved by the religion. It means money was created by the government, as such it is there money to take back. You did not print the money, the US Government did and it is their property. So much so that it is illegal to destroy a US bill, if it was your property then you could do what ever you want to it. 

No final bill has passed, but this bill will be used in the final vote. Garbage in, Garbage out, google what that means if you need to. You are ignorant if you think some of the garbage will not end up in the final bill. If you cannot create proper legislation prior to voting on a bill then you have no business writing legislation. 

Feel free to look up the above information, a handy site is http://www.google.com 
Soooooo Republicans to call for Moore to step out of the race...?

Caesar was a Roman dictator, the quote is about whether or not Jews should pay Ceasar taxes.  The government is not some separate entity that we are separated from, the government is for the people, by the people.  My labor, like every other working American, is in exchange for money of which I pay to my fellow Americans that we have elected to represent us.  It's our money, the government simply facilitates it's handling as a governing body.  So suck a bag of dicks.

The Constitution of the United States had 13 separate resolutions passed before becoming a single draft to be signed.  What is happening now is exactly how our government is supposed to work.  No Bill is perfect dumbass.

You are ridiculously ignorant and you can now go fuck yourself you fucking moron.

Moore is a case of political which hunt
What makes you think that? 
Partisanship

There is more than sufficient weight to cast Moore as a pervert who  goes after young girls. Those defending him scream "fake signature" while ignoring every single other piece of evidence relating to it. This can only be attributed to being partisan in nature. 

The whole lot should be kicked out, including Trump who has a massive string of claims against him. 


Oh I thought you were going to try to defend Moore. I completely agree.
So, Mitt didn't serve in Viet Nam? Did he have bone spurs, too?
"During the U.S. military draft for the Vietnam War, Romney sought and received two 2-S student deferments, then a 4-D ministerial deferment while living in France as a Mormon missionary. He later sought and received two additional student deferments.[28][50] When those ran out, the result of the December 1969 draft lottery where he drew number 300 ensured he would not be drafted"
So, not bone spurs?

Whew! 
Feels like Bannon destroyed his own integrity
Nope. Just vacationing in France for a couple years and pushing religion on the unwashed masses. 
I looks like Bannon destroyed his own liver.
Well, then it's a good thing he's a dishonest, womanizing, thrice-married promoter of vices like gambling and greed. 

... or am I thinking of someone else...?
Not sure about those, but he does wear magical underwear.

The real world?  You mean the one where Donald Trump is dismantling the Obama legacy every single day, the stock market continues to soar, 40,000 new manufacturing jobs have been added in the last 10 months because of Trumps "magic wand", Democrats are falling like flies for being sexual predators, the Democratic Party is at its lowest level of power in nearly a century, and Trump is doing everything I wanted him to do and the very reasons I voted for him.  

Keep being a butthurt crybaby sport, nobody gives a fuck about whiney losers.  But I'm sure it's any day now that Trump will be impeached....hahahaha.

Yes of the two major parties its the democrats that are taking the hit, your party is too busy defending a guy who molests teenage girls and said the last time America was great was during slavery...its almost embarrassing watching that party implode and trump hasnt even touched a year in office yet

It'll be a tough race. The GOP will be running against a woman in a left-leaning state, in a climate where everyone's molesting women, with the GOP having especially bad PR. If they're going to win, they need a rockstar, and preferably a woman.
The Democratic Party and it's supporters are the ones with the sexual misconduct problems.  I don't see how that will hurt a Republican candidate.
That was infuriating. 
Yeah, we need to do a better job of weeding fuckers like that out.

Classy ad hominem.

currently even the tax reform thats been passed is horrible all around for corporate and for middle class. literally the biggest tax cuts go to people earning the most when the taxes have always had the huge issue of taxing millionaires far too little. Even then they have given tax breaks to the middle BRACKETS not the middle classes. The middle brackets being 200,000+ which typically is an executive position in the USA and typically not deemed 'middle class'.

So sadly the the scrubs get a few percentages off and the big dogs get the same percentages off when that's not proportional at all. You should in fact be growing those tax brackets but very very little in order to slightly make up for the middle class cuts. Make the 1% help out the 99% because they sure as hell have not done it since I've been alive.

[Here's an infographic](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20171121154406/SEN_TCJA_Amended_Vers_Filers.png) that shows how the Senate Bill affects various types of income earners.  It will definitely be a decent-sized tax cut across the board.

The House Bill is markedly worse for the middle class -- the credits are smaller, and they phase out at lower incomes compared to the Senate Bill.  My guess is the final bill will be pretty close to the Senate bill, since the House bill would never pass the Senate.

In general, I'm pretty optimistic about the tax cut.  
did you watch the video? do you know about the case? why would you comment if you didn't?  the video is pretty cut and dry, he murders a drunk kid who is on his hands and knees crying.  he could have handcuffed him at any time and instead unloads with his rifle in the kids chest.  What in the world are you talking about when you commented? is there some other case I am unaware of? this was clear cut murder and every one is up in arms about it for a reason. oh and PS the guy he murders was not a criminal and had committed no crime, some one saw his pesticide equipment through the window and thought it was a gun.  that was all, some one made a mistake about work equipment.
The coffee shop is student run and part of a private university. All students should have access to its facilities.
Why?
Because we pay 70k in tuition, that's why.

Just because we wore a hat that they don't like doesn't mean they shouldn't serve us as well. We were not violating any school policy.

No. I don't. You aren't born a loud jerk who is screaming that this coffee shop is a safe space. Being democrat or republican isn't a protected class and I would like to remind people that it varies from state to state so much that:

"A good example of the vagaries of state laws on political firings is the case where the North Carolina Supreme Court just decided that it was not a violation of the state’s political coercion law for a sheriff to fire deputies for failing to contribute to his campaign. " - https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2016/02/01/397079.htm http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article57362858.html
Now with net neutrality's death non-mainstream media which is reliable and not just echo chamber fake news will be impossible to get off the ground.

We can do some simple math to prove it too.

So right now all of the internet can hit a non-mainstream media site that I just put up. Lets fake a url called nonmainstream.news. So how it is now I can just send you there. But now that NN is dead we have no protection that my DNS, the URL I paid 10 dollars a year for will actually work for all computers. So you might go to that site and it be just a huge ISP ad saying "please pay an extra subscription"

This isn't what might happen. Verizon and Comcast have history of attempting to things like this and being blocked before. **So non-mainstream media is dead.** 

non-mainstream media relies on cheap and easy ways to transfer information. At this point it will be better to print out flyers and go to the old ways of trying to get people to read other news. So sad we have to go back in time like this.
&gt;part of a private university.

So the university sets the rules. Deal with it.

If the person is in the wrong for throwing people out then go to the university peeps. Not here. The government in no way should step in. Even if the university is like "bro, dems only." being republican isn't protected. (Neither is being democrat.) 

Lastly all this video really shows is two college kids being stupid and loud and angry. GRRRR. "DON'T TRY TO OUT SMART ME" "I HAVE A RIGHT!" blah blah blah. Two people who need to grow up.
Please tell me how we broke any of the rules mentioned below by simply wearing a red hat:

RODRIGUE'S STRIVES TO BE A SAFER SPACE ON FORDHAM'S CAMPUS. We welcome diversity and we encourage all those participating in the Rodrigue’s community to express themselves creatively and respectfully. As such, we urge everyone in the space to be aware of their own identity, and considerate of the personhood of their peers.

For these reasons, consider the following:

Do not make assumptions about someone’s gender, sexuality, race, class, or experiences. 
Be aware of the ways in which your words and actions impact others.

Be aware of the boundaries of others’ space, physical or otherwise, and respect their consent.

No racism - No sexism - No homophobia

Please understand that the above list is by no means exhaustive; these are only basic guidelines to help foster a safer space and a more inclusive community in Rodrigue's. Ideas and actions that intend to violate any of the above are not welcome.

If you feel that someone has transgressed this policy, we want you to feel comfortable confronting them or approaching a member behind the counter, who is available as a resource to assist you. It is the responsibility of every Rodrigue’s member to ensure that this policy is enforced.

one is a protected class the other is two college kids throwing fits at each other... yeah about the same.
So what?  As you (incorrectly) said:  "The coffee shop is a privately owned business."  

If you'd been right, your own position doesn't support your argument.
Net neutrality is 2 years old.  2015 was pretty normal dude.
&gt; No racism - No sexism - No homophobia

She got you fair and square.
It *is* a privately owned business. 
Boi don't act like these people weren't rolling through Rods with the purpose of starting something - Everyone on campus knows it's a liberal spot. This whole thing was orchestrated just to get a rise outta these kids, stop acting like you oppressed smh
&gt; Please tell me how we broke any of the rules mentioned below by simply wearing a red hat:

Again. I am not your enemy nor am I your mommy. I am not going to tell you anything other than see my original comment around: 

&gt;If the person is in the wrong for throwing people out then go to the university peeps. Not here.

Have you even talked to the university first?
Net Neutrality is not 2 years old. It's been enforced since 1970 via the DNS and ICANN system and frankly up until the guy died it was one guy who would do this stuff until 1998 in which ICANN was created.

Yet the FCC has no fucking clue what they are doing or attempting to mess with. Removing these protections will then just isolate ourselves like china isolates itself.
How can you justify any 'protected class'?
Someone's been reading the front page too often

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States

" Until 2015, there were no clear legal protections requiring net neutrality"

Now explain to me what the fuck was wrong with the Internet 2 years ago that has the front page so fear mongery?
**Net neutrality in the United States**

In the United States, net neutrality has been an issue of contention among network users and access providers since the 1990s. In 2015 the FCC classified broadband as a Title II communication service with providers being "common carriers", not "information providers".

Until 2015, there were no clear legal protections requiring net neutrality. Throughout 2005 and 2006, corporations supporting both sides of the issue zealously lobbied Congress.

1. It is a privately owned business on a privately owned university.

2. if you think that somehow this being a public place allows you the right to sit there and yell at people for any reason. If this was in public and lasted enough time for me to call it in and cops to actually come down then they both would have been in the wrong and been told to leave the area. (Happens all the time in downtown metro areas with public parks or public chess boards and etc)
Did a high school student write this piece of garbage?  10 paragraphs in I still have no clue what the point of the story is, other than the mysterious title.
okay I will try to explain.

While net neutrality hasn't been "law" it goes against the reasoning behind the ISP and has become a need out of corporate greed.

So ISPs popped up a built up in the 90s and 2000s and now we have a very limited selection of ISPs even in large metropolitan places. Makes no sense right? Shouldn't anyone be able to be a coffee company or a water company? Yes. Even as water as a utility people still sell bottled water for more money and people buy it.

So what happened? Why isn't the internet flowing like water now and did it before? Yes it's not flowing how it should, yes it flowed that way before but we are seeing the effects of an unfair market and being told consumer protection bills aren't allowing the market to grow.

In reality it's impossible to startup an ISP currently because the ISPs lobby against them from getting "line" connections to the internet. They make the deals and they actively keep even companies as large as google from getting out there and giving america cheap internet.

https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140206/06594726111/comcast-backed-lobbyist-insists-seattle-doesnt-want-faster-cheaper-broadband.shtml here is one for seattle where google fiber still isn't available and personally seen micro-isps die because of these regulations.

So what net neutrality does is simply ensure that I put information in a "packet" or an envelope and put and address on it. (Typically something like "Please give me the site" To: Reddit.com) So the idea is that that packet must be handled like any other packet of it's size going toward that address. and then the server responses back with a packet to you with what you requested.

When sending the packet then travels from server to server across the world to that address. (You can see this with the windows command
    tracert reddit.com
) Net Neutrality is these rules: You can't slow the packet down or treat it differently just because of the address it's being sent to. (although if crimes are suspected then you can of course tell the FBI and report the address and contents of the packet.) Net Neutrality allows for this.

Without net neutrality we will then be required to pay for an internet connection the basically required to pay for postage on the packet which because of the nature of the internet the person you are paying postage to is not at all the person running ALL of the servers to ensure your packet gets there. So it's unreasonable to charge for postage. No one company can own the entire internet because it's collection of servers and these servers are always owned by other people and always should be. Allows for market competition.


So this is why net neutrality is important to me and why it shouldn't be a victory for republicans to turn it off. Please if you have any questions let me know.
each class has had their own battles to get to that status: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_group

So I am not really sure what you are asking. Like why have any protected groups? Because people were getting discriminated against and those people talked to their representatives, created movements, made their voice heard and went through the legal process.

Also note that if a bunch of gay people came into a shop just screaming we're here, we're queer, get use to it. Or such that doesn't mean because they are a protected class that they just get a jerk pass. No one gets a jerk pass. Cops will haul your ass to jail.
I am asking how you justify one group being allowed a protected status over any other.

The fact that any group obtained this status does not justify their obtaining it, no matter how they obtained it. Saying 'they obtained it through such and such means' is not an argument. That's an empirical observation. I am asking you to justify it. 

My view is no group should have protected status, because individuals should all be equal before the law, and giving certain individuals more rights makes people less equal before the law.
Well that's what I am trying to say. Each class has their own reason. So I can't justify any but I can justify them all individually.

And its not that republicans get protected status. A group doesn't get the status. All groups get the status of that class. So democrats (or nazis) would also get that status. So wouldn't really be possible to just give politics protected class status.
If all groups get the status of that class, doesn't that mean every individual gets it? What's the purpose of a 'protected class' then? That would mean it defaulted to just 'individual rights'.
Fuck you I'm not reading your novel.  I provided a source.  I provided a quote.  NET NEUTRALITY BEGAN IN 2015.  
I've watched the video like 10 times. First of all this Officer was ACQUITTED by a jury who knows more about the case than you or I do. The officer is highly trained professional who risks his life every day to save all of us. This criminal didn't follow instructions which clearly posed a life threatening risk to the brave officer who had no choice but to blow him to bits before he killed the cops and who know who else. Secondly he never should have been on trial because cops can't commit murder. It's technically impossible because they are cops. They're officers of the law and the law can't murder anyone. Third, better to kill an innocent man than to let a killer go free. Fourth, no one is up in arms. There are no protests. There will be no changes. There will never ever be a citizen oversight committee. Nothing will ever change and why? Because nothing needs to change. Our cops are the best in the world. If you get shot by a cop chances are you deserved it. \#maga.

&gt;It is a privately owned business.

[Citation needed]

It's a "student-run" 'business club'.  

Tuition there is $70k each year, and the student 'manager' called the "business" a "club".  If a single dollar of their ludicrous tuition supports that coffee shop/club, they have every right in the world to be there.

Next argument?

The only person yelling is the 'safe space' manager.  The video shows her accosting them and telling them they have to leave b/c they violated a policy that the university itself admits doesn't exist.

Check, and mate.  
&gt; If a single dollar of their ludicrous tuition supports that coffee shop/club, they have every right in the world to be there.

No. No that's not that how that works. In no contract did they sign and nothing that they pay for says they have the right to use that facility. It's the same way with apartment complexes. Things like the pool are provided for free, as is with a lifeguard or not

&gt;The only person yelling is the 'safe space' manager. The video shows her accosting them and telling them they have to leave b/c they violated a policy that the university itself admits doesn't exist.

I'm not defending her actions and never was. All I am saying is that all the police can do is take away the patreons in this situation because the manager must stay there for their shift. The patrons don't have a real "right" to be there. Sure they pay but if that lady had a restraining order against one of those people they couldn't come in. Same issue here. They are the ones causing issues by staying at a certain point as she must stay for her shift.

The fact here is that these people should have left and filed an complaint with the private university.

&gt;Check, and mate.

Cute.
I mean so did I but okay. whatever. Don't come to reddit posting comments if you don't expect them back.
oh yeah. So sad, totally not paid by Dems. 
I just found out about this whole Roy Moore thing. I don't know most of the details, but if she's speaking the truth that's awful and he should be put to trial. However, if she's lying, she should get charged for slander and in my opinion, whatever his sentence would have been had it been true. Either way, #MAGA
Video removed by user 
Neither of those things will happen. The statute of limitations has passed for any sexual assault and to win a slander case would require Moore to prove she lied (i.e. that it didn’t happen), which is a very high standard. People will simply have to weigh the evidence as it is now and decide what to do from there. 
In all likelihood, Moore probably dated 16-year-olds, which was completely legal in Alabama.  The yearbook lady (who is the only one to accuse him of rape) does not seem credible and is almost certainly lying.  The lady who said Moore grabbed her ass in his office has an ax to grind with Moore because he represented her mother to gain custody of her children.  The timeline for this woman seem off, and her story doesn't match with details provided by her mother (like having a phone in her room, or being picked up at her mother's house when she was actually living with her dad at the time).

I think it's completely reasonable to make the claim that Moore is sleazy for hitting on 16-year-olds, but it's another thing to try and lump him in with the rapists and sexual assaulters that have been outed recently.
Do not pretend like this is a 1 party issue. This is an issue in all parties, full stop. 
Seems like the author is complaining because Trump isn't rolling out the red carpet or providing special treatment to "media", a.k.a. liberal elites that expect to get free passes to his events so they can criticize him.  If you want to report on one of Trump's rallies, buy a ticket like everyone else.  I'm sure all the conservative small news outlets and bloggers did just that.
40 years ago social mores and laws were perfectly in line

I mean 100-200 years ago we were marrying 14 year olds
&gt; No. No that's not that how that works. In no contract did they sign and nothing that they pay for says they have the right to use that facility.

So you've reviewed the contract the students sign with the university where they agree to pay tuition with no guarantee that they'll be allowed to utilize the things their money is paying for?  You'll forgive me if I don't just take your word for it.

&gt;It's the same way with apartment complexes. Things like the pool are provided for free, as is with a lifeguard or not

That doesn't even make sense as the English language.  Every apartment I've ever lived in, along with the condo I used to own, expressly said that usage of common areas was part of my rent/HOA dues.  Can they put reasonable time/manner restrictions?  Yes, of course.  But they're not by any means 'free'.

&gt;All I am saying is that all the police can do is take away the patreons in this situation because the manager must stay there for their shift.

TIL from a reddit lawyer that you can't be arrested at work.  I should go back and let my crim law professors know.  

&gt;The patrons don't have a real "right" to be there. Sure they pay but if that lady had a restraining order against one of those people they couldn't come in.

But she didn't.  You're just making shit up now.  That's like saying 'Well if the cafe had a no-horses policy they couldn't have ridden into it.  While technically a correct statement, it means less than nothing in this context.

&gt;Same issue here. They are the ones causing issues by staying at a certain point as she must stay for her shift.

To take it all the way back, you mean like the gay couple were the ones causing issues by demanding a wedding cake after the baker said he didn't make them for gay weddings but he'd happily make them anything else?  If you're going to be a hypocrite, that's fine, I just want you to admit it.

I also like how you've completely abandoned your 'ITS A PRIVATE BUSINESS!!!!' argument with zero admission that you were just dead wrong.
So?  Everyone 'knew' that lunch counters were white people spots.  Under your argument, those minorities in the '60s were just trying to get a rise out of society.
The university stated that no University-wide safer-space exists, they did not say that the club itself didn't have one. They're trying to wash their hands of the situation. 
Oh ffs do you actually see yourself as being as oppressed as minorites were in the 1960s? Is that *really* the argument you're trying to make??

Being a minority isn't a political belief.
Its a private school, their property, their club, their rules.
And those rules are?  The university admitted no such policy exists.

I highly doubt that coffee shop is self-supporting, so if part of my $70k (which is just absurd) tuition supports that cafe, I'm going to enjoy a study session there, no matter what my hat says.
Apparently on this campus there are minority beliefs that get discriminated against.  I deal in facts, and facts don't care about your feelings.
Unless that club somehow operates a commercial enterprise on uni property with uni resources and is somehow entirely self-sufficient, and that 'club' receives no resources whatsoever from the students at large, I doubt that they have a leg to stand on.
I fail to see how a club cannot be allowed to create its own community standards for their space. The university recognizes the club's safer-space policy.

This is a very independent club, and has been allowed to be self-run with oversight since its creation in 1991, there has never been an issue.
So it's not a safe space for people who wear the American flag. That makes total sense. /s
... but it’s 2017... so, yeah, it’s pretty weird.
If I pay a membership at a gym am I allowed to go everywhere? No I am not, they have separated sections and sections that cost more, and private sections. 

Paying a tuition does not mean you can attend every event, every class, every facility. They can make up the rules as they wish as it is their property.
Facts don't really care about yours either. 

A political belief is not protected and to compare them to the shit minorities went through is ignoring the facts. 
200 years ago, you could just ***buy*** some children and do whatever you wanted to with them.

The good old days?
&gt; Secondly he never should have been on trial because cops can't commit murder

That really says it all folks. 

This is not Judge Dred, cops are not the law. You are the antithesis of MAGA


None of these things happened in 2017.

At worst Moore used to date some younger chicks 40 years ago when it was totally normal and legal
That doesn’t matter it’s 2017 now. Your past decisions don’t just disappear when the year ends. He is a pedo, and an outright racist! At least it’s not Alabama voting... oh wait, shit....
My point is people used to marry girls who were 15 or 16 and it was considered normal by everyone

Just like there's stuff today that in the future some people will think is creepy and abnormal.

Moore probably dated some younger girls that were legal because that's rural Alabama 40 years ago.

But I see from your post history you're a flagrant shitlib so I wouldn't expect common sense or reason

Good luck tonight!
There is zero credible evidence that he's a pedo

And no you don't get to hold someone to 2017 standards when 40 years ago dating a 17 year old when you're 20s was considered normal in rural Alabama.

I like how you didn’t even recognize the racist comment. Shows which way you’re leaning also...
Don't be a soyboy. Accusing people on the right of racism is such a meme that it doesn't even deserve a response.

You morons think literally everyone who isn't on your side is a racist - you actually believe it .

Most of you cucks aren't even from the south - we grow up integrated with black folks and mexican folks - you live in your whiteville suburb of Connecticut and spew drivel about racism
He Fucking said every amendment past the 10th should be removed... do you have any idea what those amendments past the 10th are? Or are you too busy figuring out where Hillary Clinton is today... he also quoted hitler, FUCKING HITLER
Sure, people used to marry younger ... but we're talking about the late 1970s and early 80s. Hardly the distant past. I was a teenager then, myself. It would have been creepy for a 30-something man to be trying to bang one of my 8th grade classmates. End of story.

&gt;  you're a flagrant shitlib

Not at all. Registered Republican since my first vote (for Reagan). The party was strong then. We had real fears of the Soviets (remember when Russkies were bad guys? I do.)

I've watched the party devolve into a fear-driven, religious-frenzied group of malcontents who wish nothing but a 'win' for themselves, regardless of the outcome and the effect on the country or the world.

This Roy Moore business is shameful. As is the *fact* that our president worked with our enemies for personal gain of wealth and power (which he only wants to get more wealth). Equally shameful.

&gt;Not at all. Registered Republican since my first vote (for Reagan). The party was strong then. We had real fears of the Soviets (remember when Russkies were bad guys? I do.)

No you aren't. Maybe you used to be, but I doubt it. You play a character now - like Jeff Daniels in the Newsroom - the mythical "I used to be a Republican but we're crazy now!!"

I mean you throw out the Russkies being bad guys like it's still the cold war and McCarthyism.

&gt;I've watched the party devolve into a fear-driven, religious-frenzied group of malcontents who wish nothing but a 'win' for themselves, regardless of the outcome and the effect on the country or the world.

Uh huh.

&gt;This Roy Moore business is shameful. 

Only if you believe it.

&gt; As is the fact that our president worked with our enemies for personal gain of wealth and power

This is where you drop the ball and make it obvious that you're lying and pretend to be a Republican to gain credibility in arguing online.

There is zero proof whatsoever that Donald Trump 'worked with Russia for the gain of wealth and power'

That whole narrative is such a crock of shit that even never-Trumpers like Ben Shapiro have abandoned it along with RINO cuckservatives.
&gt; No you aren't. 

Yes I am. I assure you.

&gt; like Jeff Daniels in the Newsroom - the mythical "I used to be a Republican but we're crazy now!!"

Nothing mythical about it. We're out there. We're real. 

"My party has gone batshit crazy."
~ Lindsey Graham, 2016

&gt; I mean you throw out the Russkies being bad guys like it's still the cold war

The Russkies were bad guys. The Republicans projected the strength needed to beat them during the Cold War. We did. But they never went away. Now they are actively undermining Western countries. 

And the Roy Moore business **is** shameful. It wasn't normal in 1978 (despite your suggestions that it was).

&gt; There is zero proof whatsoever that Donald Trump 'worked with Russia

Riiiiight.

&gt;Riiiiight.

Please provide the evidence
Your statement:
&gt; There is zero proof whatsoever that Donald Trump 'worked with Russia for the gain of wealth and power'

So if I provide just *one* piece of evidence that Donald Trump worked with Russia for the gain of wealth and power, what will you do?
There isn't any credible evidence. There has never been any credible evidence.

Please enlighten all of us - I'm sure the Democrats and their puppet Mueller would love to know too.

Do you need the contact number for the FBI?
So if I provide just *one* piece of evidence that Donald Trump worked with Russia for the gain of wealth and power, what will you do?


Well, moore just lost.  I would say fuck him and the horse he road in on, but I feel sorry for Sassy.  I hope she gets free of him.  He sure as shit is a sexual predator.  
I was a teen 40 years ago, and back then it was considered wrong for a guy in his thirties to go after a teen.  
LOL, this is 2 day old thread.  What, did you just come into the GOP subreddit to gloat about Jones' victory, ahah, get a life.
Ok, then show me the part of the tuition contract that says that the student-run coffee shop gets to make up a policy that the university hasn't adopted and which operates to exclude tuition-paying students a rondo girl finds to be icky.

I'll wait.
Oh, I have a life, and tonight it just got a bunch better!  HUZZAH!  the slimy pedo who was endorsed by the slimy, diet-coke guzzling, fat-assed liar lost.  Mwahahahahaha!  And Mueller is coming for the Bloviating One.  Along with his asshole sons, his asshole vampire son in law and his twisted entitled daughter.  Fucking conspire with Russia to win an election and go down in flames.

They comin' fo yo mr. trump.  they comin' fo yo ass.  better have another Big Mac, mr. trump cuz where you is gonna end up, ain't no McDonalds. 
Last nights loss is proof that the far-right factions in the Republican Party are going to have to work together with the Republican Establishment. If we don't work together, then we will lose in the future. It's time the GOP leadership work with the Tea Party/Grassroots to prevent this from happening again.

wait what??? tuition dollars do not guarantee use, you can't go into any area restricted for any reason just because you pay tuition.  You can't force your way into student activities, clubs, or enterprises run by the university just because you pay tuition.  Businesses retain the right to refuse service, that's a fundamental right that republicans are fighting for all the way to the supreme court right now.  You were 100% in the wrong and if you can't see that after this entire sub-reddit told you so (or are you going to say that this reddit is partisan democrats?) then you really need to pay attention in class a little more, and stop being a special snowflake upset that some one told you no.
You're literally crazy. 
What in the actual fuck is this for?!?
It's a celebration of a beautiful women who support our Republican president. Shared in this sub because I knew it would trigger you folks who don't belong.

Fake tits and dim wits!

Isn't this the same guy who tweeted out "I have info that will leak Hillary Clinton ad the DNC to the death of Seth Rich, going to congress to testify tomorrow!" /s
Thank you for making my point, since the story said the UNIVERSITY said there was no such policy.

But thanks for playing.
No policy means they can do what they want. It is their property. 

Thanks for making my point. 
the_donald is leaking
It was a joke friendo 
haha, okay, thanks for the clarification. Hard to recognize what is and what is not serious these days.
Please O'Reilly, hurry up and get that recording released by any means necessary.  If some lawyer (Gloria Allred?) is offering women $200,000 to claim sexual assault against Republican candidates, I think the world deserves to know.

EDIT: My guess of Gloria Allred was way off base, I'm sorry.  It was her daughter.
This sub is a sham and some leakage from the_Donald would help. 
the_donald is just as bad as the furthest left wing subreddits. They are no different. Two sides of the same coin. 

So no, they are not needed. 
I guess this sub is satisfied with having a handful of active users.

Someone broke this down on twitter

800 buses, not 10, not 20, not 100, not 500, 800 damn buses. With 800 drivers, with 25,000+ people would have been required. 

A video showing a dozen buses with zero context as to where they came from, who is in them, or what is happening, or where they are, is not proof.

What I wrote is exactly the truth. The grassroots went to war with the establishment and both lost. We must unite in our efforts if we are to defeat the Democrats in future elections. 
I think that if Trump can get up to around 44% approval rating he could do really well and beat him.  I think that may happen once the blue tide is over.

Once he dropped that line I knew he was just trolling.

Then I read more and fuck me I dont think he's joking
Meh, we saved the country from republicans. Half you guys were willing to throw Hillary the election because you didn't like trump.

The republican party lost me and all of my peers. Everyone I know is no longer republican. We aren't democrats for sure, but republicans are just as bad.

Because 4 cents in Tanzania is probably harder to come by than $400 in the U.S. Plus the US probably did the research to create that pill, so we pay for whatever company to continue researching while other countries just piggyback on our success. I would much rather pay the $400 here for it and have access to American healthcare than pay 4 cents there and be stuck with theirs. 
how exactly do you know it's the same?
If you follow the link claims you will see that the $400 number is actually $218 right now and the 4 cent number was cherry picked from a 1999 source.
The $.04 was definitely the lowest, but you can easily find the drug for less than $0.50 pretty much anywhere outside the US.
A good reason why the FDA is not really helpful.  

For drugs that are low volume, like for rare or uncommon diseases, it makes them incredibly expensive because the regulatory costs can't be spread over a large number of sales.  It also means there will be less development of treatments for rare diseases, since every time this issue comes up, Pharma companies are vilified for charging high prices on uncommon medications.  

For drugs that are high volume, there is so much research, and so many people involved that any action by the FDA is superfluous and their only real function is to create an additional barrier to entry for generics.
I didn't think it was possible for me to think any less of Obama, yet here we are.

Democratic arguments against the Tax Plan now fall into only 2 categories -- criticizing the fact that they expire, or complaining about the deficit.  They're not even pretending this is a "handout to the 1%" anymore, since the numbers show otherwise.

&gt; The individual tax cuts expire in 2025, so in the long term, this is bad for individuals, because their rate will eventually return to what they are now, while corporate taxes will get lowered.

Um... okay, then isn't that an argument to make the tax cuts permanent, like we did with the Bush Tax Cuts?  That doesn't seem like a good argument for not giving Americans a tax cut.

&gt; It increases the deficit and won't "pay for itself" with growth

Meh.  Deficits have never mattered.  They didn't matter when we pushed through the massive spending and "community reinvestment" bills during the Obama years, they shouldn't matter now.  I fully expect that the federal government is going to receive less revenue because of the tax cuts.  That's the entire purpose of a tax cut -- to leave more money in the hands of Americans.  
First of all there is something that a ton of people don’t know, and that is that the person who fired the gun was NOT the man giving orders. Second of all, although it was a bit extreme to shoot the man, but the man had been warned over 5 times throughout the whole video that if he put his hand behind his back then he could die, and if he did it again then he would die. What does the man do? He puts his hand behind his back.
[removed]
1) the guy who gave the orders fled the country
2) nothing these cops did was protocol
3) there was nothing stopping the police from handcuffing this guy at any time
4) these people had not committed a crime, there was a report that a rifle was seen in there room , having a rifle is not illegal
5) the woman who was with them was allowed to walk to the police
6)the man was obviously drunk, he was told to keep his hands up and was told to crawl to the police (its impossible to crawl with your hands up last time I checked)
7) stop apologizing for the police, if any one else had done something like that, they would be in jail for murder, just because some one is a cop does not mean they are above the law.

i dont want either as president in 2020


I thought this sub was for political views and news related to Republicans. Why is this on here?
Trump finally gets what he wanted out of the Republicans.  Ftfy.
Finally?  Trump has done exactly what I've wanted from day one.  
For the most part same here, but they're talking about the GOP establishment in the article. 
You want a civil war?

Because this is how you start a civil war.
You work on a quick timeline if you already judge this administration a success.
Who do you believe will go to war over corrupt people receiving indictments for crimes committed?
Well, since the right views things that are legal as illegal, and illegal things as legal, me.
that's for sure
I haven't talked a single democrat who supported this tax bill -- and that's mirrored by the zero support for it in the house/senate.
What things?
Net Neutrality.  Obstruction of an FBI investigation.
What will your reaction be if indictments are brought down upon Trump?
Collusion with a doreign govt. Money laundering...
Not enforcing Net neutrality isn't illegal.  When was Trump brought up on charges for obstruction of Justice.
Many Republicans have claimed Net Neutrality itself is illegal, as part of the anit-Net Neutrality movement.

How many FBI Directors have to be removed before it’s considered obstruction of justice?
Well, it seems the RNC doesn't want the investigation to continue. Apparantly, 7 months is just too long. Nevermind that Ken Starr spent *years* trying to dig dirt on Clinton. Nevermind that 10 Benghazi "investigations" uncovered *nothing*.

Nope. But it's important to try to start undermining the evidence of collusion and money laundering, and rattling the reputation of the FBI and DOJ.  Which is all this is about. But hey, continue to play dumb, and act like the problem is anyone but the Republican party.
hes accomplished more than both bushes combined in one year.
What exactly is it that you think Trump colluded with Russia about?

What money laundering?

Would you be concerned about an investigation if the people investigating you were having discussions about how much they hated you and how they needed an insurance plan to keep you from achieving what you had just achieved?
Are you being pedantic? Do I need to run down every step of the widespread allegations? You know, the ones in the dossier you claim to be so concerned about, that it's provenance is a *legal* affair?

Regarding being investigated by "people that hate you" I assume you're alluding to the "scandalous" FBI emails? The ones that were heavily edited before being released as evidence of a tainted investigation, where the agents also slagged Hillary? Are you suggesting that those texts, from a single agent since fired, taint Mueller's entire investigation?

Were you equally concerned with the FBI NYC field office, that fed Rudy Giulani tips on the Clinton email investigation during the campaign?

Should Rudy be investigated?
Wow. Are there any American Republicans in this sub? This article is *embarrassing*.
You mean the dossier that the Clinton Campaign paid for?  That's your big proof of Trump and Putin plotting to over throw our democracy?  That's schmuck level idiocy.

Who's editing the text messages?  Was he being a sweetheart when he said "fuck Trump"?  Just a little joking around when he called Trump a douche and his family "the douchebags"?

How about when Strzok said ""God Hillary should win 100,000,000 - 0.", is that OK coming from the lead investigator into Hillary Clinton's dipshitery with her  hacked Homebrew server?  Are all these comments ok for someone who is supposed to be part of an "impartial investigation"?


No, I'd say the proof is in Mueller's investigation, FranklinAbernathy. The one the Republicans are currently undermining. 

As for once again dragging up Hillary's emails, go ahead and investigate them again, for all I care.

What proof?   This bullshit has been dragging on since before Trump became president and all they've come up with is a volunteer staffer who tried to set up meetings that no one took and Flynn lying about something that was perfectly legal.

Honest question, what exactly do you think this huge conspiracy is?  What indictments are you waiting for and for what crimes?

Obstruction of Justice?  The president can't even be charged with it so that's a worthless thought.  Treason?  What is it that you think he's done?

Looks like the DNC and Clinton Campaign funded author for the fake Trump dossier isn't so sure of his findings now that he is being sued for libel.  The S.S. Bullshit is sinking and the nets are waiting for the rats to jump ship.

Man, you just go ahead, continue to ignore reality. 

I'll check back in a coupla months with an I told you so. But I doubt you'll believe it when its happening.
Reality?  You mean the reality where the author of the dossier is being sued for libel and is now backing off his claims of the dossier accuracy?  

How are you not accepting this as reality?  
I guess you're just ignoring the investigation, then. It's like saying that the investigation into Nixon wasn't legit because Deepthroat leaked illegally. 

And The Washington Times? Bitch, please.
The investigation is based off of a fake dossier paid for by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton Campaign.  I'm not ignoring it, I think all those involved in the lies and unmasking that led up to it should be exposed and prosecuted.

This isn't a banana republic, we are a nation of laws and using fake opposition research provided by an opposing political candidate as an excuse to spy on a campaign should worry every American.  The only people who tried to subvert our democracy are those involved in fraudulently picking a nominee, providing fake research so they could spy on the opposing candidate, and have since appointed people who are on record for hating the person they are "investigating".

Uncuckable Tuck!
Muslim ban NOW!
1) happened in Australia

2) got 2 years probation

3) he is a minor

4) no rape, no sexual assault, its sexual misconduct. 

5) he pleaded guilty

What did you expect to happen? a hanging? a stoning? that is a pretty standard sentence. 
Two years is a long time. How long do you want to punish a minor for being a horny teenager and touching women. 
[deleted]
So if a Catholic gropes someone are you going to call for a Catholic ban? I highly doubt it. 
How is this Republican news?
That is a false equivalence and you know it.  This isn’t a case of one Muslim did something once.  Muslims are massively over represented in sex crimes in (insert Western country here).  This is a widespread phenomenon in the Muslim world.  It’s not in the Christian/secular world, but if Catholics or any other group of people reliably behaved like this, then yes it would be appropriate to bar them from entering a country.  
&gt;Muslims are massively over represented in sex crimes in (insert Western country here)

Provide evidence.

When Catholic priests were touching children did you call for a Catholic ban? No you did not. When Catholic leadership hid those crimes, did you call for a Catholic ban? No you did not. It was a widespread phenomenon and you did not call for a Catholic ban. 

It is not false equivalency it is racism and bigotry.

I started watching Fox when I discovered Tucker Carlson. ❤️ Tucker!!
Doesn’t most of Africa’s healthcare get subsidized by western countries who send billions? 
But isn’t it interesting that a party that has always ran on equality, esp for women, has been backing tons of men who have/are abusing/harassing women? Some of these men were known but people kept it quiet. Looks very bad for Democrats. 
I do not care about playing political games with this. This is not a 1 party issue, this is an issue in all parties, full stop. 


I guess it's too hard to #metoo a movement against religious tyranny they don't have to deal with in a free country. God bless the founders and the constitution. 
Yes, women in America who are sexually molested should just suck it up because people in Iran are worse off. Always could be worse eh? So just accept it women of America.

Bullshit statements like this article are just that bullshit, and can easily be flipped on Republicans. This is just as bad as the left saying Republicans support the KKK because they did not say enough when they protest. Its bullshit.


The me too movement isn’t just about molestation. It’s about any woman who has felt harassed, and that can include just touching a woman’s shoulder or attempting to hit on her. Just bc a woman says she was sexually harassed doesn’t mean she is sane. Tons of women have falsely accused men of rape. 
Do not de-legitimize the ones that actually were attacked because some were false. 

The original poster made no distinction between those who were making up stories and those actually attacked. Many women are on the receiving end of sexual assault and that can range from full out rape to groping to other stuff. 

These are American women that should be protected but instead they are being told to shut up because Iran is worse off. 
Listen. I’m a woman and I can even acknowledge that women lie. There are two sides to every story. If it’s someone you know to be truthful, then of course you can believe them. But the women coming out in the media are unknown to most of us. So why do I have a reason to believe them? It’s their story, I don’t know the people allegedly harassed and I don’t know the accused harasser. People need to stop with this notion that you automatically have to believe a woman bc other women have been told to shut up. Makes no sense.

The op made no distinction between the two groups, just that American women should be quiet and be thankful they are not in Iran. 

Let the cycle continue apparently. 
Firstly, I was referring to your first comment to not delegitimize women who were attacked bc some lie. 

Secondly, the bugaboo that people have is that American women are fighting for equality but when Iranian women, who have much more to lose (their freedom or even life), all you here are crickets from the left. It’s called hypocrisy.

This story tells almost as many lies as the Liar-in-Chief, trumpass does. What a stinking pile of  nonsensical shit.








Why is trump inviting Foxconn here?  Maybe because "Fox" is on the name and he thinks it has something to do with fox news.  Foxconn has a crappy reputation both with polluting like hell, and with human rights abuses.  This is the company that has to put nets around their overfilled employee rooms so people don't kill themselves by jumping out. 

Typical GOP BS.  Human rights don't matter to them.  Shitting all over the environment doesn't matter to them.  Just as long as the CEOs and shareholders get fat and rich. 
This will never be done with.  No political party or politician except maybe Rand Paul wants to be the scorn of the media if a terrorist attack happens after it's allowed to expire.  The media would blame the people who didn't vote in favor of it and that's the reason it won't ever go away.
CNN, MSNBC, nyt, wapo, et al. 
Fox is pretty biased too... just biased towards me and my opinions.
I used to think that, but after seeing just how far left all the other networks are I'm starting to believe they may actually be pretty middle of the road 
Are you high? They’re absurdly far right. 
To someone absurdly far left, middle of the road would seem like absurdly far right.
I'm a huge fox fan.  If you think fox is middle of the road you are insane.  Almost every host openly admits they are conservatives.
He blames Obama but this started under G.W Bush.

The reason he is not going is because he will be protested, hugely.

Not at all.  You're absurdly left if you believe that.
It's great to think that something will be done to end this, but it won't.  Neither party wants to be the party that ends it and then a terrorist attack happens which could have maybe kind of in some sort of way been prevented because of the domestic spying.

Look what the media did to Rand Paul when he stood against it.  
No. You’re on crack if you believe they’re center. They’re just as biased right as msnbc is biased left. Never mind the fact that studies have shown that Fox News watchers are less informed than people who don’t consume news channels at all 
First of all, not necessarily, and secondly I’m not super far left, im central and my stance really depends on the issue being discussed. There’s tons of things where I’m on the right side. There’s just no way a rational thinker could think fox isn’t biased. 
Trump to boycott U.K. over feelings.
Note how this is a ranking of public perceptions about media bias, not actual media bias.

Little surprise, given our politicians' tactics of deflection about media bias and fake news.
Huh.. what's the word for someone who avoids situations because of their precious feelings.. snowman?  snowfall?  Something like that.

The hats don't really look like vaginas.  more like pink cat ears.  And it was republicans who first used the term tea bag.  Feb. 27, 2009
At the first anti-stimulus "New American Tea Party" rally in Washington D.C., a protestor carried a sign reading "Tea Bag the Liberal Dems before they Tea Bag You!!" The Washington Independent's David Weigel calls it "the best sign I saw." 

Then Americans for Prosperity, an anti-tax group, encouraged people to send tea bags to senators and representatives to protest the stimulus package.  Other right wing lobbying groups enthusiastically followed suit.  Soon, by early April, many Tea Party protest sites encouraged readers to "Tea bag the fools in DC." Jay Nordlinger at National Review Online later admits: "Conservatives started [using the term]... but others ran and ran with it."

So, get over it.  Our founding fathers protested harsh taxes by dumping tea overboard in Boston Harbor.  What the tea party protestors were fighting against, most of them probably hadn't a clue.  Like those people who hold up signs that say "Keep the Government's Hands off my Social Security!!"  Having no clue that they are receiving government issued money via a government program.

One of the first times the tea party protested was against the bailouts set up by Republican President George W Bush.  On February 27, 2009, to protest the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) U.S. financial system bailouts signed by President George W. Bush in October 2008, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 stimulus legislation signed by President Barack Obama. Since the entire world's economy would have gone down the drain had those bailouts not happened, we should tip our hats to both Presidents, Bush and Obama.  

The Tea Partiers, or the tea baggers as they called themselves Often resorted to ugly behavior during their protests.  (this was what was so funny.  They wore tea bags on their hats, and used the term themselves, not realizing that sadly, the term had come to mean a very odd and crass act.  The irony of them calling themselves that term cemented it forever.)  On March 16, 2010, at a Tea Party protest at the Ohio offices of Rep. Mary Jo Kilroy, a counter-protester with Parkinson's disease was berated by one of the protestors and had dollar bills thrown at him with additional protesters also mocking the individual. The man initially denied the incident, but later apologized for his "shameful" actions. Nothing like mocking a cripple to bring out a patriotic, right wing fervor.


In another incident on March 10, gay Congressman, barney frank was called a faggot and other anti-gay slurs were shouted at him.  African American members of Congress including John Lewis and Andre Carson had the n word yelled at them repeatedly by tea party protestors.  Again, the protestors decided to be as disgusting as possible.  typical behavior for them.


As for the pussy hats.  If trump had managed to keep his damned hands to himself and had not bragged about how he likes to grab women by the pussy without asking , thise hats would not be a thing.

So suck it up and deal with it, if y'all don't like it.  You came up with the term tea bagger in ignorance, and you wore it proudly.  we took it and ran with it.

Wow man. I support your right to think however you want but um wow. 

Hey everyone else! I spotted one in the wild! 4 points for me!
Maybe because broaddrick herself denied she was raped while under oath.  And there is zero proof it happened.  Both the FBI and Ken Starr investigated her claim and found no merit in them.

Also, they are called *pussy hats*, not vagina hats.  And there is nothing vulgar about vaginas, but it is very vulgar to go around grabbing at them sans permission.

They have hosts that are openly and admittedly Conservatives.  They're daytime news coverage and the nightly news desk man, Brett Baier, is not biased.  MSNBC is almost entirely opinion based so the two networks don't even have the same type of programming.  So you have no clue what you're talking about.  Shephard Smith is a gay liberal and he's Fox New's #1 live coverage host for fucks sake.

The "study" you're citing is from a friend of John Stewart and he has written books on him, so you citing that as anything more than a joke is ignorant at best.

I would have responded with no rudeness but because you're an idiot, it's only fair to call you a fucking moron for not knowing any better.

We do not need a wall it will be a waste of money. Use that money on infrastructure around the USA whether it be at repairing/remodeling airports or improving interstates or sewer systems in certain cities like tampa or fixing the issue in flint Michigan. There are so many better things to do with the money than build a wall they will dig under or bring a ladder and climb over. 
Except no, a land barrier like a wall has proven itself to work in places like Israel. Boarder protection is of the utmost importance unless you want more illegals to come in and suck up welfare.

I'm assuming that censored post was pointing out that the parties are switched now, which is a fact, no matter how many Dinesh videos you spam.
Any other examples with real data to back up your assertions? 
No, but I think some R losers like Graham will cave, despite holding all the cards.
I’m glad.  I know many of his legislative goals aren’t far from Trump’s, but it matters how the President speaks about things.  Tyrants around the world have taken rhetorical cues from him in their own media crackdowns.  Just because his words haven’t been backed up with anything doesn’t mean they aren’t having a negative effect on innocent people.  It also doesn’t mean he won’t try to back up his words with actions later.  Better to quash it now.  

If he doesn’t want negative stories he should try not doing and saying unnecessarily negative things. He could achieve much of his agenda without being rude and crude, and probably be even more successful.  
Pointing out blatant lies from the media is rude and crude?  Flake is a piece of shit and that has nothing to do with Trump.  Flake had zero chance of being reelected and this is likely nothing more than posturing to run as a Democrat down the road.
Challenging and denying stories is one thing.  Resorting to “lugenpresse” is another.  Most stories about Trump pan out in the long run, and someone with his tendency to lie doesn’t have a leg to stand on for calling out “blatant lies”.  Flake isn’t going to run as democrat since he is pretty reliably conservative in governing philosophy.  
[removed]
The president just laid out the top ten lies the media has reported during his presidency so far, so according to you there is nothing wrong with that.  Flake just bitched and moaned about it and then compared our president to Stalin, which is not only idiotic but historically inaccurate. 

Time will tell for if Flake will be a turncoat.


Top ten? More like only ten.  One of which was an opinion piece by an economist that hasn’t even had enough time go by to measure its fakeness.  Another has still not been proven false, and in fact has much more evidence indicating it is true.  That’s the collusion one.   The rest were almost all corrected by the media, wether by original source or a competitor, before anyone in the administration did.  

What he’s doing is cherry picking isolated events, misrepresenting them, and painting the entire industry with the same dirty brush.  It’s effective, but it’s bullshit and beneath the office. Speaks terribly to his character and honesty. 
Obama's communication team would attack radio, cable news, and anyone else who reported on him in a way they disagreed with.  Was it "beneath the office" when he did it?  Clinton and Bush did the same thing.

It's like you people have the memory of a goldfish.
"You people"?  I've voted consistently for Republicans since Dole '96.  When Obama tried to bar Fox from the briefings, it was beneath his office.  As you'll recall, Fox's competitors were against the move and raked him over the coals for it.  That's the only Obama incident I recall.  He would point out when others were lying, but not reporters that reported verifiable facts.

The biggest key is that while all of them may have complained of unfair coverage from time to time, they never made it a centerpiece of their term.  They would counter specific stories with specific rebuttals, and if any denials were later found to be true (I did not have sexual relations with that woman.), they were few and far between.  This is wholly different from labeling the entire industry "fake" because they report on things the President doesn't want to be reported.  

Was it fake news when they pointed out that Trump's inauguration crowd was smaller than he claimed?  

Was it fake news when they reported the claims of his sexual harassment accusers?  

Was it fake news when they reported his and his staffs connections to Russia? Was it fake news when they aired video of controversial remarks?  

Was it fake news to report when he took credit for things he had nothing to do with?

See what I'm getting at here?  He doesn't counter reports with proof of inaccuracy. He just claims they're inaccurate.  We're not talking about an opinion host making wild claims.  We're talking about sourced, corroborated, and verified reports of what's going on.  He calls that fake news, but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

The Republican party railed against this and are using it as justification for this behavior, then taking it 10 steps further. Showing that they are capable of far worse. These attacks are something you see in Russia and third world countries, not the US. 

The Obama team never went to the lengths that Trump and the current Republican party has. Not even close. Feel free to provide evidence to the contrary tho(actual quotes, not perceived thoughts that someone has been insulted). 
The Democratic Party tried to regulate news organizations by reinstating the Fairness Doctrine.  Obama said that Fox News wasn't even news.  The Obama White House routinely excluded reporters they didn't like from their events.

From the Obama White House communications director, “Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party.”

As I said, the memory of a goldfish fish.

&gt;Was it fake news when they reported the claims of his sexual harassment accusers?

You mean when they didn't report that the lawyer representing the "accusers" was outed for trying to pay people to accuse Trump?

"A well-known women's rights lawyer sought to arrange compensation from donors and tabloid media outlets for women who made or considered making sexual misconduct allegations against Donald Trump during the final months of the 2016 presidential race, according to documents and interviews.

California lawyer Lisa Bloom's efforts included offering to sell alleged victims' stories to TV outlets in return for a commission for herself, arranging a donor to pay off one Trump accuser's mortgage and attempting to secure a six-figure payment for another woman who ultimately declined to come forward after being offered as much as $750,000, the clients told The Hill."

Yes, it was fake news when they continuously report that there is a Trump/Russia connection.  It's been over a year and the only thing they've found is a volunteer who tried to set up a meeting that no one attended and that Flynn lied about something that was completely legal to do.

You're an idiot if you don't see how corrupt the media is.  With the WikiLeaks emails from Podesta that show numerous "reporters" colluding with the Clinton Campaign, there is no excuse for remaining this ignorant.
Saying that they are not a news source or pointing out that they are closely connected to the Republican party(which is correct, that is well established, to claim Rupert Murdoch is not a major player in the Republican party is to ignore reality) does not justify the absolute attacks on the free press coming out of Trump. He is actively attacking and discrediting the entire press, minus fox of course.

No president in the history of the US has ever attacked the press to the extent that we see today. No president has ever shown photos of themselves assaulting a news agency. No president has ever held fake news awards.

&gt;As I said, the memory of a goldfish fish.

I remember quite well, and I will remember that the current administrations has attacked the press like no other administration in history. Obama's administration did some things that were not okay, but that is not justification for the current attacks and as I said, this is 10 steps further. 


Foxes use 28 different types of calls to communicate with each other
.... weird ass bot, kinda like it. 
John Adams signed the Sedition Act which made it illegal to publish anything negative about the government.

Before Roosevelt, reporters had to submit their questions in writing and the president may or may not answer them.  Roosevelt called the media "The Liar".

I could give numerous more examples but that is enough to prove you have no clue what you're talking about.

Yeah, those damn Dems with their majority control of every branch of government, if only the Republicans had the majority...
To stop what's happening with the vote, Republicans would need a supermajority. Let's just ignore the lobbying by the Democrats to get other Dem. congressman to vote no that were going to vote yes because there's no Dreamers crap attached to it...

But nice try trolling. 
Who controls the fate of this memo? Republicans. It does not need a super majority to release it. 

Which means this memo is a lot of hot air. Keep seeing quotes about how bad this is, and it will be the end for mueller, it will destroy obama, but oh wait, even tho we have a majority we can't release it because the minority dems won't let us. 

Can we stop with the victim complex? Republican's are in charge yet it is still always the other guys fault. What happened to Republicans being the party of personal responsibility?
Or both parties could try to, you know, compromise.  To a lot of people, DACA isn't "crap".

Not trolling.  It just says something that this is (to my knowledge) the first time a government shutdown has been a looming possibility while one party controls every branch of the federal government.
Limbaugh is a dinosaur 
You're pretty rude for being such a moron.  /U/imbalanced is talking about the budget, not the memo.  Try spending less time being an arrogant moron and more time understanding how our government works.  
You may have meant /u/imbalanced instead of /U/imbalanced.

They can't stop a shutdown without a supermajority.

From the article directly:

&gt;Government shutdown to take the good news of the Trump administration and the dossier memo off the news reals


I'm with you. 
Supermajority requirement means they don't control this action. 
He was talking about the budget. And rush isn't wrong whether you agree with how house repubs are using the memo or not, it's a negative story for dems until it is released. So rush is right, a shutdown removes this negative story for the dems. 

Edit: 'it' changed to 'the memo'
&gt;, it's a negative story for dems until it is released.

Only among a few places. It is common knowledge that the Republican's own the house, senate, and presidency. The group that created this memo, is Republican. Republican's are the ones responsible for this memos fate.

Yet all i am hearing is "the dems dont want this released" "dems trying to hide this" "dems dont want you to see this"

Well show the goods and stop playing god damn games. There is zero excuse for GOP to bitch about this doc not being released as it is them that will not release it, they control the fate of this doc. 

Until this is release it is just hot air meant to whip up the base and nothing more, and it will work. That Dem released a document based on a cold, yet we cannot release this? bullshit. 
Yes they can. By compromising and negotiating like members of the government should. Not stomping their feet and expecting 100% their way on a bill that requires a supermajority. Republicans own this. The entire country knows it.
He's crazy. Not "right".
So we agree on the result. I think you're painting it a little easier to release than it is. Yes house select committee could release without declassifying beauracracy, but you're missing the results internally. 

If it's true and it's very bad for DOJ, how does that change the operational status of the fbi, intel, etc WHILE we have an active threat in dprk, plus known investigations on domestic terrorists? 

Political hackery is afoot but let's not act like there certainly aren't huge considerations outside the political arena stalling the release. 
&gt;If it's true and it's very bad for DOJ, how does that change the operational status of the fbi, intel, etc WHILE we have an active threat in dprk, plus known investigations on domestic terrorists?

If this were accurate then they would not be screaming on twitter and on the news and in forums about this. It would be kept under wraps. They are specifically announcing it to the world, the dems sure as hell arent, they are supposedly implicated, so why is the GOP and blaming dems?

&gt;Political hackery is afoot but let's not act like there certainly aren't huge considerations outside the political arena stalling the release.

Then by screaming about it to the rafters, to have actual government reps talking about this would be to compromise national security. So which is it? bullshit or a national security risk? If it is so sensitive why are they screaming to everyone that will listen? 

They could have easily said it was a matter of national security, but they didnt, the said it should be released and it was the dems fault for not releasing. How the hell does that work? 

Those saying it's the dems fault are lying and should suffer. 

You aren't mentioning that 200 some thousand Russian based twitter accounts blew this story up, it wasn't specifically repub led. 

Russia wants our country destabilized whether that's good or bad for either party. A reduced intel, fbi is good for Russia. 
Rush is blaming the Dems and many listen to Rush. Nunes is also blaming the Dems. Trump Jr is doing the same. There are lots blaming others for something that is within their control.

&gt;Russia wants our country destabilized whether that's good or bad for either party

All other issues aside, I wish the country could agree on this. Russia is out for Russia and they will fuck with other countries, that is how they work, always have, always will.
The government shutdown is over spending measures you nitwit.  The dossier memo doesn't require a supermajority or a 60 vote threshold to be released.

All of you arguing that are ridiculously stupid.  A simple Google search for "Schumer shutdown" will lead you to numerous articles talking about the government shutdown.  Stop being a lazy moron and read.
So they have to actually compromise to pass a budget for our nation of mixed constituents. Boo hoo :(
So they have to actually compromise to pass a budget for our nation of mixed constituents. Boo hoo :(
If you believe the Democratic Party is willing to shutdown the government in January over DACA which isn't even up until March for no other reason than demanding we give illegals citizenship, then you are ridiculously stupid.

There is no excusing your stupidity and you need to be shamed for being such a gullible idiot.  Hopefully this will cause you to think for yourself and see that you're being an idiot.
&gt;The dossier memo doesn't require a supermajority or a 60 vote threshold to be released

Then stop bitching, release it, and it will be in the news again, just as Rush wants. Repubs are bitching about Dems blocking this shit and as you stated, it is entirely up to the Repubs. 

The second it is released it will become the news. That is the basis of the article.
The government shutdown is about spending measures and DACA.  The Bill would require a super majority which Republicans don't have so they have to have Democrat votes for it to pass.  

Rush is saying that the Democratic Party is only doing this because they are trying to draw attention away from the dossier.  Being that DACA isn't even ending until March it's pretty easy to see that Rush is right.  

Why are you arguing on a subject that you don't know anything about?  Are you even self aware enough to realize just how dumb you look right now?
&gt;Rush is saying that the Democratic Party is only doing this because they are trying to draw attention away from the dossier

Then release it, problem solved. Right now there is nothing to distract from, all we have is random statements and rumours with no action.That is not news, not by a long shot. So act, release it, and then if not picked up then raise hell. 

&gt;Being that DACA isn't even ending until March it's pretty easy to see that Rush is right

If he were right then he would be asking why it has not been released yet and discussing that. Instead he is trying to change the narrative.

I smell a giant piece of shit with people trying to change the story. 
House Republicans have already called for the release of the dossier.  It's going to be released.
So they are calling upon themselves to release the document that they are preventing from being released? They have full control, don't call for it to be released, release it!!! Hell the author is Nunes.

Republicans are in charge here, no supermajority or dem excuse.

That is like me calling upon myself to stop hiding and release the document that I created.


This is my last comment to you because you are a fucking moron.  The memo has top secret information in it.  It can only be released if the House Majority Leader allows it.  But first it has to be gone through so as not to release top secret information to the public.

That is what's going on now.  They made the House members who read it sit in a monitored room while they read it for funks sake.  Holy shit you are a stupid fucker.
&gt; The memo has top secret information in it

Then why the fuck is the GOP blasting about it on Twitter and the news? If it had secret information in it, then they should shut the fuck up and not discuss it or demand for it to be released.

&gt; It can only be released if the House Majority Leader allows it

Who is a god damn Republican.

I will repeat it for you, as it is apparently needed. If it has top secret information in it, why the fuck are they demanding it be released and blaming the Democrats for it not being released? If it contained national secrets their mouth should be shut, or saying it will be released after being sanitized, but that is not what happened now is it?

So which is it?
It amazes me that governments never realize that the people generally want compromise. Always play black or white, meanwhile everyone else lives in grey. 

If the population handed enough seats to demand a compromise then that is what the people should get.
And I linked to some random website "on the issues" ... I know you all deeply concerned about abortion etc.. ... "pro-life" until the baby born though right? I mean you don't want to support the baby with welfare or something... so explain to me, what betterment do you expect your party to do for humans?
Just about anything the government does it does incredibly inefficiently and it creates perverse incentives.  I would  prefer to limit the role of government and have the gap filled by private charities and churches 
Democracy
Why are you here? To shitpost?
We expect the parents to be parents and for the government to take less of our money instead of taking more from us and then dictating how we have to raise that kid. We don't want a government except for defense, border security, and (actually) interstate commerce facilitation. 
If it was a shitpost, why is it the top-voted comment?
Not wanting people to kill hundreds of thousands of babies per year. I think that is somewhat more significant then sending aid money to third world dictators. 
Because reddit loves shitposts? Shitpost, not shit post.
That's easy, any cause where people donate voluntarily instead of having their taxes increased.
Pro-Life until they are born right? I mean you don't want to help them/pay for welfare once they are born...
Why would I assume this child is going to be a non contributing  member of society? I want to give them the chance to live their life, not live it for them. 
Bingo

People don't get abortions because it is just "something to do." They usually get them for a reason (and before a brain is even developed on the child)- and that reason is that they are not in a situation that would be good for a baby (poverty, youth, health/drugs, etc...). A baby is then born in to this environment and what happens to most kids in an unwanted or an environment, or impoverished one- or one that might hurt the mother? Typically babies born in this situation often end up in the foster system or needing other government support, or do not become a contributing member of society.... Of course, Some may make it out just fine, but vs kids born in a wanted and healthy environment? Not many.   
Why, if republicans are so concerned about pro-life etc.. are they always wanting to cut the programs that would help these children, and seemingly have no concern for them once they are born. I mean I would think logically, that if one wants to really push the pro-life agenda, they would also really support advanced welfare and education programs so they had more of a chance to become a contributing member of society. 
Why make no mention of the FIVE republicans voting against the measure? Keep eating those propaganda boogers from nut-wing radio. See if it's any good for your long-term critical thinking and reasoning skills.
We believe in a safety net for those who have fallen down or those who can't take care of themselves.  If you can work, you should work.  It's how a flourishing society thrives and it gives purpose.

If your career is popping out babies and getting welfare then you are a burden on society.  Why is it the taxpayers job to take care of those who want to be lazy leeches?  The quickest way to lower welfare costs and increase the workforce is to cut long-term benefits.  The Democratic Party used to believe this too, look at Clinton's record if you need proof.  Now the Democratic Party is the party of the lazy and ignorant. 
They still wouldn't give the Republican Party 60 votes dumbass.  Good zinger there moron.  
Which is exactly my point. At least get the entire republican conference on board before spewing your predictable, eye-glazing "democrats, democrats, democrats" whining.
Republicans support plenty of humanitarian causes. They support them voluntarily with charity.

Democrats want to force others to give money to causes whether they support them or not. They call it welfare.
Ok, when were the parties switched? Find that time please. Ok, now find out how many Republican congressmen switched and how many Democratic congressmen switched. I'll wait.
I would like to be the first to thank you for exposing me to this channel.
I have never heard of Republicans defunding food stamps and housing assistance.


So no women have abortions just because they don't want a baby?  No middle class or rich women have abortions?  
Your point is that you are a moron.  Yeah, that's been established.
Not many people NEED to come across!
Dude... Get out of r/republicans
Wait... Are democrats in favor of spying or republicans? It seems a little wrong to spy on us because 40 people out of 350 million in the USA want to blow up a mall or something.
I support nearly any humanitarian cause that does not involve stealing from other people to fund it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy
**Southern strategy**

In American politics, the southern strategy was a Republican Party electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans. As the Civil Rights Movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South that had traditionally supported the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. It also helped push the Republican Party much more to the right.

In academia, "southern strategy" refers primarily to "top down" narratives of the political realignment of the South, which suggest that Republican leaders consciously appealed to many white southerners' racial resentments in order to gain their support.

GOP is always trying to make cuts in these areas... Most recently even bigger cuts than Reagan. Paul Ryan is trying to cut from social programs as we speak... billions. Can google it yourself or ... https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fiscal-entitlements/u-s-tax-revamp-still-incomplete-as-republicans-eye-social-program-cuts-idUSKBN1E22MD
I'm sorry I don't have faith in humanity enough to expect that everyone will just magically take care of everyone else if these programs were cut. I've seen countries with no to little welfare programs (just look at all the poorest countries/countries with biggest disparity), and then countries with super awesome welfare programs (yes- the Scandinavian ones) who seem to be doing pretty darn good. 
I agree that people popping out babies is a bad idea, especially for more checks... so hey, how about we improve the birth control program for them? Maybe they have to take it/shouldn't have more kids to get their checks or something?   
Could also just improve education and improve society as a whole... but that would require government spending, and well would be a lot less republican voters as well (except for those who become super rich i guess?). 
So, what programs should the government not have?
Birth control is ridiculously easy and cheap if not free in this country so what more would you like to do?  Forcing people to take birth control?  So fascist dictatorship is your goal?

Trump won white college educated voters by a 4% margin.  
That was something Nixon tried to do (and pretty much everyone today hates Nixon) and that wasn't even the cause of the South becoming Republican. They became Republican because of economic growth in the South. In the 50s, before the Civil Rights, 43% of low income southerners voted Republican while 53% of high income southerners voted Republican. In the 80s, they were 51% and 77% respectively. In that time the poorer southerners barely increased in votes but wealthy ones went to the right a bunch. If it was based purely on race, they would've been close to equal.

So the south went from socially liberal to socially conservative because of the economy? And your link is to an opinion piece.
It seems like the best situation is when private charity works hand-in-hand with government. I think the trick is getting government to help out without getting the idea that they have to throw as much money as possible at every cause out there.
As related to this topic, most humanitarian programs should not be a function of government.

Edit: The mere question indicates to me that you potentially think that humanitarian programs require government oversight and/or funding.  To me, this is forced theft from one person to provide to another.  This mindset to me is a false choice between being a miser and being generous. Individuals have the capacity to be very generous, and if allowed to keep more of the money they make, and spend less time filling out tax forms (for charitable giving, for instance), there will be many more resources available for charity and humanitarian causes. You need to look no further than Bill gates to see a great example of this. We are a generous people and to me, it's degrading for someone to force you to give, and for the government to decide what causes are worthy or not.
Making small cuts is not defunding.

I don’t understand the question.  People are individuals and support whatever humanitarian causes are important to them.  I’m an independent but I vote republican almost 99% of the time anymore, and I personally donate to the Wounded Warrior Project, the Ronald McDonald House, and my church.

Or do you mean the Republican Party as a whole? Politicians tend to donate to charities associated with their political characteristics, you know, to look good to their targeted voters.

Well there's an obvious flaw in your thinking, not all counties are equal. Scandinavian countries can throw their money into welfare programs, they have hardly little immigration or military so the money is there for them. Poor countries are usually poor because of lack of resources, or their history of being on the wrong side of mercantilism. 

Republicans want good deeds to be done. We just believe that government efficiency is poor and that individuals have better efficiency. The gvt can supplement the inefficiencies with modest welfare programs. But they don't supplement, and they poorly implement. 

Your lack of faith in people isn't surprising. But I have less faith in the government than I do people. I do believe most people are well intentioned and if they could would donate, however maybe not efficiently. Every time a major hurricane happens how's the governments response, and how many ppl take their wallets out and donate? 
I would rather have the chance to live life than not live at all. Many aborted fetuses could have developed into brilliant scholars and functioning people in society, but we have no idea. 

Many of these programs should be delegated to states, because they know their circumstances better than Washington. You don't need welfare to help poor people, you need a stronger economy and stronger communities. When the gvt takes control of responsibilities that should be local or state it erodes community bonds and a sense of compassion. The more local and community oriented welfare programs are the less abuse and more efficient they become. Having children wouldn't be as terrifying or nearly as much of a  financial "burden". 

Trust me, I just went through this dilemma two years ago, I understand the gut reaction of wanting an abortion. We were pretty damn poor and had great family and community help. Now we both have new salaried careers. It hurts to see a compassionate argument for abortion when I know what the outcome has been for me and my family.

abortion, civil rights, etc. They also changed race, age, religion.

The South only changed since then into becoming mostly FOR Civil Rights. I've spent my entire life in the former Confederacy (unless you count tiny trips) and I have never met a person who was against the Civil Rights Acts. Honestly, for the other things you mentioned, I can't compare the rest them to what was historically viable... The South is more Christian, if that's what you are referring to.
 
By the way, a lot of Liberals say that the parties switched during or after the 60s, depends on who you talk to. FDR, a DEMOCRAT in the 40s, said this, and I quote, "A conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who, however, has never learned how to walk forward." If the parties switched, well then FDR was a rebel who disliked the ideology of his own party.

He was a northern democrat
...and? The biggest differences between the north and south democrats were during the Civil War... it was still a Republican vs. Democrat campaign, even if he was Northern. He was a democrat, he was a liberal, and he was both those things before "the parties switched."
So this will increase the deficit by how much more?

Risking the future of the nation with massive tax cuts and no plan to fund them. Oh, I forgot there is a plan, "we'll figure that out later".

Irresponsible governing at its finest. 
until somebody goes to jail, I'm not satisfied
northern democrats were not anything like the southern democrats. Are you trying to say that liberals were the confederates?
I thought that was the point of this argument... At the very least they were the ones that voted for the Civil Rights Acts at a lower percentage. FDR was against Conservatives and was a Democrat. Northern or southern, they were similar, especially after the Civil War period. The northern and southern dems wanted independence for the Confederate states. They used the same candidate for election, if they were as different as you are saying they would've supported someone else. Also, don't pull the "Conservatives defend the status quo" crap because I'm pretty sure a slavery filled new country is a bigger thing to prevent than the abolishment of slavery.
Are you trying to say liberals were the confederates?
Actually, no - the beliefs and problems back then were too different than today to place them on either side. The Civil Rights is my main argument here, and the Republicans were conservative back then. If they were Liberal, then either they would've been liberal before - which means the Dems would've been conservative, which means FDR would've been conservative and not said that quote. Or, the Republicans would be Liberal today, which obviously isn't the case.

&gt;I'm sorry I don't have faith in humanity enough to expect that everyone will just magically take care of everyone else if these programs were cut.

Define "take care of".  Speaking in generalities, "taking care of everyone" sounds great, but when we get down to what that actually entails I'm willing to bet that my definition would include some things that you don't want your money going towards and your definition would include some things I don't want my money going towards.
it wasnt black and white where one day everything changed, and if you think that republicans were conservatives in the civil war then you have to believe that the union was Conservative, which is crazy.
&gt;I know you all deeply concerned about abortion

Not all of us.  Contrary to the picture you've painted that justifies your smug "holier than thou" attitude, plenty of non-religious conservatives who don't give a rat's ass about abortion.  You don't have to like abortion to recognize that if the government can make that medical decision for you, you've effectively given them the ability to justify making any medical decision for you.  Just like the right of Nazis to rally in public is a price we have to pay for absolute freedom of speech, so too is abortion a price we have to pay for absolute bodily autonomy.

&gt;I mean you don't want to support the baby with welfare or something

Why is supporting someone else's child my job?  Why should I take money I would be using to put myself through school or to save for a house and give it to the government so that they can subsidize someone else's poor choices.  

If you want to make this about the needs of the innocent child being paramount, how about this: if you have a child you can't take care of, then it's taken away and put up for adoption.  Go ahead and ban foreign adoptions to increase the pool of prospective domestic adopters.  Congrats, you've just provided a means to ensure every child is in a home where they can be reasonably taken care of, and you didn't need to take people's money under threat of putting them in prison to do it.  

&gt;what betterment do you expect your party to do for humans?

I don't expect to better anyone, I'd rather foster circumstances that allow people to better themselves.  Let's take the money that we hand out to people who choose not to work, and spend it on job training.  Let's stop subsidizing college degrees that qualify you to be a barista and put that money towards making a college education in STEM, medicine, or business more accessible.  And let's stop taking money from the working class to fund politicians' ideologies, and let people decide what they value enough to pay for out of their own pockets.
Umm... I just said that we can't blame either side for the Civil War, it was so long ago and problems were extremely different. I am saying Conservatives are to thank for the Civil Rights Acts, because Republicans were Conservatives then.
Yes we can, it was southern conservatives who wanted to keep their slaves. 

No, Republicans were liberal during the civil war and no amount of revisionism is going to change that fact. 
Fine, I didn't want to argue this, but you've forced my hand.

Republicans wanted to keep the country together instead of letting a third of it become independent. Bigger deal than slavery. Lincoln didn't even want to free the slaves, he wanted to keep the Union together, the status quo. The Emancipation Proclamation was a diplomatic strategy after Gettysburg to make the war about slavery and keep Europe from intervening. Also, Andrew Jackson, the founder of the Dems, was the one who pushed for the Indian Removal Act. Pushing an entire people out of their home isn't the status quo, it's something new.
So far their platform is fuck Americans, we love illegals.  Also, Russia, Russia, and Russia.  And Trump just made them look like idiots with the government shutdown.

Not looking too good right now.

I am a bot trying to encourage a balanced news diet.

These are all of the articles I think are about this
                story. I do not select or sort articles based on any opinions or
                perceived biases, and neither I nor my creator advocate for or
                against any of these sources or articles. It is your responsibility
                to determine what is factually correct.
Then maybe you should call up June of 2017, when we might have cared.
So he likes the individual mandate now?

I don't think you understand how this works, colonel. 
Hasn't our tourism and job creation went down since January? 
He just likes the mentally gymnastics for health reasons.
Heritage's healthcare proposal from the 80's is very different than the pile of shit Obama and the Democrats did with Obamacare.  
How is it supposed to be understood?  Mueller wasn't fired so it's meaningless.  What's the big revelation here?
Because Trump lied over and over about how he never thought about firing Mueller. This was back in June so why wouldn't he just tell the truth? He's allowed to fire Mueller it just looks bad because his only reason is that he's leading an investigation against him. 
&gt;it just looks bad because his only reason is that he's leading an investigation against him.

Have you not seen any of the reporting about the text messages from Page and Strzok?  Mueller has hired a bunch of lefty hacks to "investigate" Trump.  I'd be pissed off too if I had to deal with that bullshit.
Lol
Shocking.  Another dipshit who actually believes Trump and Putin colluded together to take down our democracy.  How you people can legitimately be this fucking stupid is terrifying.
I may be a dipshit at least I'm not under investigation for obstruction of justice 
You are a dipshit, there's no maybe about it.  I hope I never get to the point in my life where the representatives I support are so batshit crazy that the only hope they have of gaining any power is by wishing they find a procedural misstep for a crime that was never committed.  

It's sad.  But fucking hilarious to watch nonetheless.  Enjoy the next 7 years of Trump.
I hope I never have as much hate in my heart as you do. But anyway, you have a nice day sir!

In the conversation up till this point the primary claim being made really is that Trump stated he did not try have the guy fired. The importance of this article is in showing that he did. Is this in question or not?

The second claim is that he was doing this to impede an investigation against him. Is this in question or not?
You're more safe over at the Donald where you're conspiracy theories fly high
What conspiracy theory?
Looking at your post history I don't know where to start 
So you have nothing but idiotic remarks about things you've made up in your head.  Great contribution moron.  
He'll die of a stroke or heart attack before then. 
The White House doctor who was appointed by Obama just stated that Trump was in great health.  You're watching too much fake news.
Ok. Just going by age and the fact that he is overweight. 
I don't want some fucking IDF patrolling our border shooting kids in the face. That's the only way Israel's wall works. Fuck a wall anyways, that's some communist shit. 
No, no. Just point the finger at "Hover-hands Franken", what a monster!
Even though these girls are hot, this is somehow one of the gayest posts I've ever seen. 
Damn man, you must love the taste of boots. Lick 'em clean. 
Then please, explain me how this works. Are we supposed to run around screaming with our hair on fire because Trump *didn't* do something stupid? Let's leave that for /r/politics. We're supposed  to be better than that.
Assuming this "anonymous source" is correct...so what? You want to prosecute Trump for thought-crimes now? And Obama said he never knew Hillary had a private server, and now we know he emailed her private server regularly. That's not just a thought-crime. That's a regular crime. Where's your outrage over that?
If you're just going to troll, please go back to /r/news. You'll get all the "hur dur drumpf is a criminal" stories you want.
Did you ever consider that the reason /r/news has one sided Trump hate is because most people hate Trump? And that any reasonable person with morals wouldn't support a man like that?
That's rich. Did you want me to pull up your post history of you trolling multiple other subs? I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, colonel.  I really do want to be friends.
Yet. I have some anonymous sources that say you colluded with Russians to swing the election. If you try to deny it, or claim my sources aren't credible, that'll only prove my theory!
The House Intelligence Committee voted to release the FISA Memo that allegedly compiles thousands of FBI reports into a 4 page document that shows the many abuses of the American people's constitutional right to privacy.  This will include the Obama administration using the DOJ and FBI via NSA technology to spy on a Donald Trump while he was still campaigning against Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was openly freaking out over the memo being released yesterday.  It seems like there are some serious misdeeds about to be exposed.

I do find it comical that the party that said the Steele Dossier must be released because the American people have a right to know, are now saying the American people are too dumb to understand the memo so it shouldn't be released.  Democrats being hypocrites, what's new.

It appears that while working w/ the FBI, Steele and Fusion GPS were also working for the Russian government.  Not only did they abuse FISA 702 searches but they were being fed information and potentially being funded by the "KGB."  Lastly, the 2nd Dossier provided by Cody Shearer appears to be another blatant hit piece by a long-time Clinton flunky.

Completely unrelated to how firing Comey launched an investigation or his desire to fire Mueller, I’m sure.
Trump is taking the Hitler/Nazi playbook. We’ve known this since day one. I’m a polisci student and we’ve been trying toneducate the mases on this point. What we saw at the SOTU last night was loke the Nuremgurgh rally, with the GOP doing their seig heils ar the end, it was fucking scary to watch.
Who the hell wrote this article? It's full of legit bullsh*t. 

"We don't know for sure how average Americans viewed his speech. But we do know that it was the kind of speech that Americans like."

Hold up..... If you dont know how average americans viewed his speech then how do you know it was the kind americans liked? Was it really a speech that Americans liked? No it wasn't. Do you know why? Well for starters facts clearly ment nothing last night as Trump threw out HIS statistics that were complete bogus. Not to mention when he was talking about all the storms, and Texas what they went through but yet not a word about  Puerto rico and the one million people that still don't have power. Nothing was said aboout climate change because news flash, the commander in tweets is a full blown moron.

These "resistance" losers are afraid of everything. They're afraid that President Trump is going to make all the women barefoot and pregnant because he might appoint a Supreme Court justice who would overturn Roe vs Wade. They're afraid that climate change is going to make the planet literally uninhabitable. They're afraid to go outside because they think that cops are just going to start shooting at them. They're afraid that Trump is literally Hitler. They're even afraid of tax cuts. 

This "resistance" really is the saddest group that I've ever seen.

Totally not obsessed with Obama tho....
Fearful people are easy to control.  It's not by accident that politicians use fear as a mechanism for votes.
They're far more afraid of a booming economy and roaring return to the badass America of the 80s and early 90s when we celebrated how awesome our fighter jets were and were proud to be #1

Their whole identity is wrapped up in a complex web of victimhood and national self hate
They're busy crying about competitive victimhood, we're busy Making America Great Again.
I disagree.
3rd worst president in the United States. FDR and Clinton have the top spots.

Yeah hope is all she has left. That book deal turned sour after Mr Trump unwound everything Hussien accomplished. Who is more angry? Her, Pelosi, Iran or the Palestinians?
I agree.  Because of Obama the Democratic Party lost over 1,000 seats across America.  Obama's shit presidency has given the Republican Party majorities in the House, the Senate, the vast majority of State House Chambers, and all but 15 governorships.  And the best thing to come out of Obama's failed presidency, we now have President Trump.

So, thanks Obama!  Thanks for being such an enormous failure!

What kind of bullshit news is this? Comparing how many times the last two presidents said 'I' at the SOTU? Rediculous. 
like lying to FISA courts and giving hundreds of millions to Iran?
[removed]
He was saying that looking back on all the speeches Americans have listened to, this was a speech that (based on our history) Americans like. And it was important that he did point out that he can't speak for every American, but based on his experience and how he felt about the speech, he was comfortable enough to say that it was a speech that was well delivered.

And where are you getting your information from where you can accuse our president of using made up statistics? Because I know just from partly paying attention that our economy is doing better than it has in the past 18 years. Also that in his first year he has fulfilled most of his campaign promises, something not many presidents have done. I only got to watch a short amount of the speech and was definitely moved and felt that this guy (Trump) was doing the right thing for America.

Could he have mentioned the people in Puerto Rico who still don't have power? Yes. Could he have brought up why he opposed climate change and maybe shed some light on what he thought needs to be done? Yeah sure. But that's two things he didn't touch on versus all the other things he mentioned that are doing America good! I feel that trump is more of an in your face go getter DOer than any president I've seen. 
Whoever this guy is who wrote this article just tried to tear down Trump's whole speech by over analyzing a single sentence. Do these liberals know how rediculous they're being and how out of their mind they make themselves look? They make Trump and his Twitter posts seem necessary in comparison. 
No you are right he could of talked about a million people with no power or climate change but instead he decided to touch base on things like "clean coal". There is no such thing as clean coal it's a chunk of carbon. Let's not forget he even said after his speech that it was the most viewed SOTU ever... sorry Mr. President but you are wrong again because it wasn't, even Bush and Obama  had a better viewing numbers then this year's, so no it is not a speech that Americans liked as you said it was and it's proven in the viewing numbers that rolled out the day after. 

If you actually checked his "facts" that night you would find he told a lie ever 4.5 minutes. But instead of actually getting your facts right you just believe anything he says, and that's fine that is your decision and you are entitled to it. But this doesn't mean he isn't wrong. Honestly it doesn t matter what I say I got my information from because now days anything that goes against Trump even by the slightest it must be "fake news" so there is no point to even beginning that argument. 
Delete this post IMMEDIATELY 
I have a feeling that this is part of what the FBI and DOJ were going on about. Now the question is, what other stuff has either been "ommitted" or altered to suit the narrative, if any.

Never trust Nunes to run with something, he is incompetent and so quick to conclusions that he usually gets things wrong. 
Lol yeah let's just all bury our heads in the sand and ignore anything that challenges the narrative we want... 
This entire thing started from a fake dossier.  
GTFO with your bullshit, shill. 
This article is an appeal to ignorance.
This article is literally citing the facts.

Do you dispute the Comey testimony? Do you dispute how Nunes characterized it?

Both are now a matter of record, so do you agree that they are at odds with each other? If this part is wrong then do not take the rest of the Nunes memo as gospel.
So that justifies a false report to Trump?
Which part is bullshit? I am not here to trade insults, discuss the issue at hand or as you put it GTFO.


[removed]
This is hardly some huge find.  The "significant inaccuracy" is hardly the point of this memo.  The point is that the ENTIRE MEMO is a fake paid for by a competing political opponent.  It was pushed by Hillary and the DNC and then McCain.  It is fake.
This doesn't seem to be all that significant.  Comey says the dossier contains salacious and unverified information.  Nunes says that Comey said the dossier is salacious and unverified.  Wow.
He had an interview that he was scheduled to be in. Trump's SOTU speech went over 80 minutes, and he had to make it out to the interview.
[removed]
Obama lackey doesn't like Obama Administration corruption being exposed.  In other shocking news, water is wet and Michelle Obama has a penis.
The FBI said the memo was all accurate. The people trying to push that the memo is fake are the same people that it damages. OP drank the kool-aid. Poor guy.

&gt;The "significant inaccuracy" is hardly the point of this memo

It is a memo to Trump on the FBI, with major implications. It had damn well better be accurate. If you can't get it accurate then you have no business writing this.

&gt;The point is that the ENTIRE MEMO is a fake paid for by a competing political opponent

I believe you mean dossier, or did you mean memo? or is that not the point?
No they did not, they told everyone there was omissions and inaccuracies. Straight from the mouth of the director of the FBI.
There is a pretty large rhetorical difference between contains and is. 
The dossier contains lies.  The dossier is lies.  Both say the the same thing, neither implies that there are **no** truths in the dossier.  It's semantics. 
You're confusing memo with dossier. The dossier is being accused if being fake by a memo containing demonstrably false facts. The FBI said that the DOSSIER contains a mix of verified and unverified (does not mean false, just not verified by a second source), not that the dossier was false in it's entirety. The Trump appointed Director of the FBI released a statement saying that the Nunes memo contained " material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy". Meaning that the Nunes memo is wrong. 
The article is arguing intent and semantics. If any part of a document is salacious and unverified the whole thing may as well be. The "verified" parts could well be that's Trump's middle initial is "J" and we could happily argue that *well at least part of the dossier is verified.*  
  
It's arguing semantics, and therefore pointless.
In this case, semantics are very very important, and no, the dossier is NOT lies, it is unverified allegations in places, but multiple agencies and people confirm that some allegations are verified. 
Really.  Which allegations have been verified?
What you just said means that the truth isn't all there, not that what is there isn't true. Wording is everything in government. If the memo was false, they would have said so. 
This is a memo meant for public consumption.  They also want to release all evidence to the public.
This memo is one big nothingburger 
[removed]
Intent is political gain.

&gt; If any part of a document is salacious and unverified the whole thing may as well be.

Which is why the FBI broke it down and said parts were unverified. At no point did they say the entire thing was accurate. The FBI does investigations, that is their job, their only job, they would have taken this and investigated the various claims. 

They do not take tips as gospel, politicians, partisan people, and the media do.

&gt; The "verified" parts could well be that's Trump's middle initial is "J"

Right, if that is all you have then we are done talking.
Sure, go ahead. I already pulled yours. You've got virtually no karma in here, but you have 2,289 points of karma in the heavily censored /r/news liberal circlejerk.
Wrong, this was a memo for the President and the committee, it was subsequently declassified for public consumption, it was never directed towards the public.

Lol, do they now? Trump's [average poll numbers](https://realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html) are getting up into the mid 40s, and a recent [Rasmussen poll](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/trump_approval_index_history) has his approve/disapprove numbers tied. That's where Obama was for [virtually his entire administration](https://realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html#!)? If that means "most people hate Trump" I guess that also means "most people hate Obama".

haha, no this was meant for us to read.
"As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy"


You have clearly not read the memo.

Please tell us, who is in the "to" field ?


haha, you need to understand that when you write a letter like especially since it was advertised as well, TO US, they meant to release this.  That is absolutely obvious.  They just did it by the book to do it.
The FBI lies by omission to the FISA court...then complains about "omissions and inaccuracies" in this memo? Ironic.

That's not the bombshell. The bombshell is the FBI using the dossier as the main evidence to get a FISA warrant to surveil members of the Trump campaign, and ultimately start the Mueller probe. They effectively lied by omission to a FISC judge. If true, that's pretty damning. It would mean Democrats effectively used the their oppo research and politicized agents in the FBI to bootstrap an investigation into Trump, despite there being no real evidence.
1. Nunes is inferring from what he’s seen that entire dossier was salacious and unverified, and that it was used as the basis for the FISA warrant. 

2. Comey didn’t specify during his open door testimony whether all or only parts of the dossier were salacious and unverified, nor did he specify whether the dossier was used as the basis for obtaining the FISA warrant (this fails to mention any matters discussed during his closed door testimony)

3. The author is implying that because Nunes’ characterization doesn’t match verbatim with Comey’s testimony (nor does it contradict), that the entirety of Nunes’ memo should be disregarded. 

E: grammar and clarity 
Pease refrain from blurting out insults without providing something worth talking about.

Except that's not true.  Carter page was under investigation under FISA warrant in 2014... but that led to no charges.  FISA warrants have to be renewed every 90 days, it's not like Carter Page was under investigation for 4 years with 16 resubmitted FISA requests.
What booming economy? The Dow dropped almost 700 points yesterday and was logged worst week in two years 🤣

This is where you pull your fake news card right? 
"material omissions of fact" is code for "they left out crucial details intentionally". The memo is absolutely meant to distort and misrepresent the facts of the situation with the sole goal of attacking the reputation of the Russia investigation. 
When you bring up the Russia investigation, it reminds me that you're a clueless cry baby just screaming Russia Russia Russia over and over because you lost. Grow up and just deal with the fact he won. The Russia investigation is the distraction, and time will prove me right.

Sorry, but is this the_donald? Republicans can disagree with how their own party is run, especially when there is factual errors in a supposed mega report that was supposed to be bigger than watergate. 

Maybe address the comments instead of providing a useless comment. 
Considering all of the information proving that Russia took actions intended to influence an election, I don't think that attempting to get to the bottom of what exactly happened makes me a clueless cry baby. I think denying that there were foreign elements that acted to influence people's choices is being clueless. 

I think that it's interesting and odd that the very same people that just a few years ago believed that Barack Obama was wrong to deny that Russia was our enemy now refuse to believe that fact. I think it's odd that the same people that profess to want "clean and fair elections" refuse to seriously investigate verified allegations that a foreign power meddled in our elections. 


What purpose could you possibly have for not wanting the truth to come out? The Republican party was so determined for the truth, that they spent hundreds of millions of dollars and countless hours investigating Benghazi, where only 4 people were killed. But heaven forbid this investigation find anything... 

Don't you think that's odd?
Just to make a point, unverified does not mean false. It just means that we don't know. I could put a card face down in front of you and tell you it is the Ace of Spades. But you don't know for sure what it is, my statement is unverified. Once you turn it over and see it's the two of clubs, THEN my statement is false. Assuming something is true or false when it is unverified is logically unsound.
I mean, it is entirely possibly that Carter Page has been under investigation for 4 years with 16 resubmitted FISA requests. Wouldn't surprise me in the least.
ONLY 4 people? You just lost all credibility in my opinion. No one died in this election except Seth Rich, and the only thing hurt was your feelings. I don't care if the investigation goes forward. I just presented an opinion that it's a waste of time. You're also wasting your time by posting random babble that doesn't prove anything. 
Yeah, exactly. That's why a "salacious and unverified" dossier shouldn't be used as justification to get a FISA warrant. You can't assume it's true.
I'm sorry you feel that way. 
Well xx the verified parts were used, while the FBI admitted some other, unused, parts were unverified and salacious; i.e they hadn't actually seen the pee tape
Sorry I feel that 4 lives is 4 too many? You're despicable. 
You forget the fact that it was also started because of Papadopoulos (also a Trump campaign adviser who already plead guilty in the Mueller investigation)  bragged in Australia about knowing that Russia planned to help Trump. The Australian government transmitted the info to the US, and that's how it started.
&gt; Nunes is inferring from what he’s seen that entire dossier was salacious and unverified, and that it was used as the basis for the FISA warrant.

Some things from the dossier have already been proven true. Some things remain unverified. Nothing has been disproven. Until now, the dossier remains overall true or unverified.

To borrow a term from Adolph Hitler, *"if you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed."*

This was one of those times when the left and their allies in the media lied enough about the tax reform bill that people all over believed it was a "swindle", and that their taxes were going to go up. It hasn't taken long for opinions to change once the cuts became reality. Outside of the relatively small number of people caught up in the "resistance" cult there won't be a lot of people against this tax plan before you know it.

1. Nunes has revealed that he has not actually seen anything, this is third hand reporting. 

2. That is exactly what his testimony said, he said parts were, not everything. It is public record what he said.

3. Wrong, he is saying that it needs to be questioned, questioned is not the same as disregarded.
So much for respecting law enforcement.
Here's an [article](https://www.justsecurity.org/44697/steele-dossier-knowing/) written by a former CIA agent about it. (note that it dates from September)
But the article specifically uses the Steele dossier as a source.  Can you provide a source to confirm any of those claims which doesn’t use the Steele dossier as its main point of reference?

That's absolutely a two way street. There's a reason that conservative media outlets sell a story of America where roving gangs of rioting BLM thugs, murderous illegal immigrants, and sleeper cell Islamic terrorists are a very real threat in the lives of average people. They want conservatives to believe that, because fearful people are reactionary and easily manipulated. 

Both sides of the aisle would heavily benefit from pulling their collective heads out of the asses of mainstream narratives. Both sides are being played like a fiddle to achieve ends that serve neither side.

Who is this Conservative media and where are all of these stories trying to scare everyone from the "rioting gangs of BLM thugs"?  Over 80% of illegal aliens picked up by ICE are criminals so its pretty hard to report on an illegal alien who isn't one.

What examples do you have of the left being played like a fiddle?  Just curious
Tax cuts are good . Tax cuts with increased government spending is bad. Reports show that the government is set to borrow almost 1 trillion dollars this year . That’s an 84% increase from last year and the highest amount borrowed in 6 years. Not such a great move budget wise 
&gt;But in an appearance on “Fox &amp; Friends,” Nunes was asked about reports over the weekend that the FBI application did refer to a political entity connected to the dossier. It is unclear precisely what language the application might have used.

&gt;Nunes conceded that a “footnote” to that effect was included in the application, while faulting the bureau for failing to provide more specifics.

Nunes may have not liked the wording, or where the info was put, but to make the claim that political bias was never revealed is completely false. He has purposely mislead the President and the Public.

So now we have a misquote on Comey, and a factual lie regarding political bias disclosure. 

Anything else Mr. Nunes?

Are we not supposed to be better? We can't rail against those things and then turn around and do the exact same things.

That is hypocrisy, and there is nothing more that I hate that hypocrisy. 
If you go into /r/conservative or /r/conservatives they are pretty heavy handed with the bans. I understand some balance but also against hypocrisy.

&gt;September 2016

Correct me if I am wrong, but was the FBI investigation not closed at this point and had not been re-opened yet? They had closed it earlier that summer, no?

Keeping in mind the FBI report was released Sep 2, 2016


I HEART President Trump
It was indeed closed and not reopened til October. 
Obama was a lying, corrupt, and incompetent president.  Of course he had his hands in this, that is when he wasn't using those hands to stroke Michelle's cock and balls.
Also, we don't know what "this" is anyway. Text messages are missing a lot of context.

How about instead of demonizing someone who is no longer in power, we find a way to defend Americans rights while not spending all of their paychecks on pointless projects? 
Ummm... it's been confirmed that the texts were about the Russian influence.
You can’t choose to take it when you’re 6, being taken by adults, no way you to support yourself without said adults, and have no understanding of law.

don't forget, if they don't agree with you, they're not *really* republican
By all realistic definitions, what the democrats were trying to do was nothing short of treason
I'm not sure that's true anymore though...this whole idea that the Steele dossier was the only or central piece of evidence presented to the FISA court just doesn't have legs. It's a huge nothingburger.

Trump said this memo would vindicate him so I guess I'm confused as to why he didn't just release it despite DOJ concerns (as he did with the republican memo).
The doj, fbi, cleared the memo with the exception of some fbi director trump found to argue against it, on top of that it had unanimous approval from the the congressional security council (reps and dems) this move was political, pure and simple.  no idea why other republicans are not upset by this.  between the budget and this nonsense I can say definitively there is no reason to be a republican any more for me.  I am just going to say I am fiscally conservative and call it a day.  time to really start looking at third parties at this point. gonna edit and say that his attorney general also said it was fine, so he had to find an assistant attorney general to complain about it.
Lol whatever man.

God forbid Republicans actually win anything or *gasp* PLAY POLITICS.

MUH FISHKULS REPONABULITY
How so?
I thought that was the whole reason most republicans voted for them, because the deficit is out of control and dems cant control there wallet.... guess for you its just "my team needs to win".  What makes them your team? why do you vote for them?  If they can't handle immigration and fiscal responsibility, then whats the difference between them and the dems? dont say abortion or social issues because half a billion dollars to PP, and all the social personal scandals that come out every day tells me they are exactly the same when it comes to that.
&gt;this whole idea that the Steele dossier was the only or central piece of evidence presented to the FISA court just doesn't have legs. It's a huge nothingburger.

No it isn't.

There is sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation by another special counsel into the corruption of the FBI in their handling of the clinton 'matter' and usage of phony memo to obtain FISA warrant

There is far, far more evidence that all of that is real than there ever was that Trump colluded with the Russians - which was a nonsense political distraction originating during the wikileaks reveal of Clinton emails
The Democrats put methods for information gathering so rather than release a heavily redacted version, the WH has asked that they take those things out and give back an updated memo for release.

You believe a dossier funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton which used information provided by a Clinton associate and actual Russians who wanted to influence our election, which was then used as proof to gain a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump Campaign is a nothingburger?

You can't possibly be that ignorant and dense.
Gowdy specifically said that the warrant would not have been granted without the dossier. 
Yes, that's true. 

You did, however, omit some specific details:

* He explicitly said he doesn't believe that the memo vindicates Trump in any way. He said "even without a dossier...there's going to be a Russia probe."
* He explicitly said that the dossier, it's political motivations, and the fact that it was used to obtain a surveillance warrant for cater page do not *in any way undermine Mueller's investigation.*
* He explicitly said that the dossier did not form the basis of Muellers investigation. It had nothing to do with the infamous meeting at Trump tower. It had nothing to do with the email sent by Cambridge Analytica. It had nothing to do with the charges brought against Papadopoulos (who has since pleaded guilty). It had nothing to do with obstruction of justice (a charge that Mueller investigated after comey's firing). 

I do not believe that ends justify their means. That being said, at this point it's hard to think that we *shouldn't* have been watching Carter Page given what we know now about the actions of Trump's campaign staff. 
&gt;You believe a dossier funded by the DNC and Hillary Clinton which used information provided by a Clinton associate and actual Russians who wanted to influence our election, which was then used as proof to gain a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump Campaign is a nothingburger?

Before I we get into the weeds let's establish one thing from the onset: **The Dossier did not form the basis of the ongoing investigation being conducted by Robert Mueller.**

* The dossier was not the basis upon which the FBI opened their initial investigation. 
* The dossier had nothing to do with the infamous meeting at Trump tower. 
* The dossier had nothing to do with the email sent by Cambridge Analytica. 
* The dossier did not form the basis for the case against Papadopoulos (who has since pleaded guilty and is working with special council). 
* The dossier had nothing to do with obstruction of justice (a charge that Mueller looked into bringing against Trump for Comey's firing).

Now lets take a look at your claim and see if it holds. 

**Your Claim**:

* "Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump to feed it to the FBI to open up an investigation into the Trumps campaign."

**What Actually Happened**

* The Clinton campaign, via a law firm, did seek "dirt" on Trump and Russia. Steele did rely on Russian sources, supposedly contacts mined from his years as a spy. Steele did actively seek to draw attention to what he had found, though virtually no reporters wrote about his allegations before the election because they could not confirm them. And the FBI did use Steele's reports to help obtain a court order allowing surveillance of a Trump associate - *but that was after Page had quit the campaign.*

* For some, that may seem like a lot of smoke. But it's a huge leap to say Clinton colluded with Russians to do this. Instead, you have (a) the campaign hiring (b) a research firm that hired (c) a researcher who spoke (d) to Russian sources. Steele, for his part, has suggested he tried to alert reporters and the FBI because he was appalled by what he had discovered. The closest connection to Clinton is the fact that Steele gave to the FBI material written by Clinton associates, but it's unclear what the FBI did with that memo.

* Meanwhile, there is little dispute over the finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia developed a clear preference for Trump - and that Russian entities hacked into Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign accounts to obtain emails that were then leaked to undermine her campaign. It certainly would have been a sophisticated game of three-dimensional chess for Russia to simultaneously seek to undermine Clinton's campaign while supplying her with information to spur an investigation of Russian activities on behalf of Trump.

* Finally, the Nunes memo disclosed that the FBI opened a counterintelligence operation in July 2016 because of allegations concerning another Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos. *But Papadopoulos was never mentioned in any of Steele's reports.* He came to attention of the FBI because he had told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had obtained thousands of Clinton's emails. He has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with the special counsel.

**To Summarize**

Was the dossier used to gin up media attention to Russia-Trump ties and bolster an existing FBI investigation? Perhaps. That's certainly a question worth exploring.

But the media needed little prodding to investigate when candidate Trump appeared unexpectedly solicitous of Russian President Vladimir Putin as Russian-linked entities leaked emails stolen by Russian hackers in the middle of a campaign. Meanwhile, the initial FBI counterintelligence probe was prompted not by Steele's reporting but by the loose lips of a Trump campaign staffer.

Finally, there is no evidence that Clinton was involved in Steele's reports or worked with Russian entities to feed information to Steele.

Yes it was.

I didn't bother to read the rest of your comment as I imagine it's likely based off of you incorrect assumption.
No, it's reviving the middle class reviving manufacturing, fixing the trade imbalance, raising tariff's, kicking out illegals, effectively curtailing immigration from terrorist laden Shitholes, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, implementing effective policing measures to control crime, lowering taxes....

All these things are much more important than the deficit.  It's like worrying about running up the hospital bill fighting cancer.  I'd love a balanced budget and paying off debt, but right now it's not the top priority of anyone paying attention. We need roads that work and water you can drink and gas pipelines that don't blow up and good blue-collar jobs long before we have to worry about issuing more t-bills at a NEGATIVE interest rate.


Budget monomaniacs are irritating spergs who seem to think the only thing that matters is two years of non-deficit spending before the lack of any other meaningful accomplishment destroys any hope of getting something worthwhile.


CHRIST, but stupidity abounds. MUH DEBBICIT
I acknowledge that the dossier was key in obtaining the surveillance warrant. Move past that. 

I'm trying to inform you that the the Russia investigation began months before the warrant was sought. 

The Steele dossier was not what caused the FBI to open an investigation. 

http://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-opened-russia-probe-after-papadopoulos-told-australian-diplomat-of-clinton-dirt-2017-12

**The memo itself states that FBI agent Pete Strzok opened the investigation in July 2016 based on information about Papadapoulos, not the Steele dossier.**

Was the dossier used to gin up media attention to Russia-Trump ties and bolster an existing FBI investigation? Perhaps. That's certainly a question worth exploring.

Beyond that, the hype around this memo is another blatant attempt to undermine peoples faith in the FBI. 

https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/the-trumping-of-the-fbi/552641/
So you acknowledge that I'm correct and a DNC and Clinton Campaign funded dossier being used for evidence for a FISA warrant, none of this being disclosed to the FISA Court, and the only people who have actually been proven to having been involved with Russians are the Clinton Campaign and the DNC.

Thanks but I already knew I was right.  Now as an American you should be worried that a previous administration colluded with a presidential candidate to spy on their opponent by using unverified salacious claims to gain a warrant to spy.  How you've allowed yourself to be fooled in to believing that's a nothingburger should make you stop and reflect on what bullshit you are allowing into your brain via tainted and bullshit media.
&gt;So you acknowledge that I'm correct and a DNC and Clinton Campaign funded dossier being used for evidence for a FISA warrant, none of this being disclosed to the FISA Court, and the only people who have actually been proven to having been involved with Russians are the Clinton Campaign and the DNC.

Actually, no. I cannot acknowledge what you describe. It is a mischaracterization. To begin:

* The Clinton campaign, via a law firm, did seek "dirt" on Trump. As did the Trump Campaign for Clinton. It's called opposition research. It's a huge leap, however, to say Clinton colluded with Russians to do this. Instead, you have (a) the campaign hiring (b) a research firm that hired (c) a researcher who spoke (d) to Russian sources.
* There is little dispute over the finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia developed a clear preference for Trump - and that Russian entities hacked into DNC and Clinton campaign accounts to obtain emails that were then leaked to undermine her campaign. It wouldn't really make sense for them to provide her with information that would work against this strategy. 

&gt;Thanks but I already knew I was right. Now as an American you should be worried that a previous administration colluded with a presidential candidate to spy on their opponent by using unverified salacious claims to gain a warrant to spy.

Again, I think you might have gotten confused along the way. 

* There were open FBI investigation on members of Trumps campaign. 
* The FBI submitted a surveillance warrant request that contained dossiers that were produced by a 3rd party called Fusion GPS. 
* People thought the FBI abused its power by including information from a biased source. 
* Nunes has publicly stated that the FBI did indeed include a footnote referencing Steele’s political leanings.
* I'll repeat that again: **Nunes has since acknowledged publicly that the FBI did indeed include a footnote referencing Steele’s political leanings.**

It's also worth mentioning that foreign-intelligence gathering often involves using information from sources with private or political agendas. Including information of this type was standard practice. 

The idea that this was an orchestrated effort to collect opposition information via a wiretap is a little ridiculous. The Secretary of State would not even be granted access to any information gathered over a wiretap for such an important and high-profile federal investigation. 

&gt;How you've allowed yourself to be fooled in to believing that's a nothingburger should make you stop and reflect on what bullshit you are allowing into your brain via tainted and bullshit media.

No need for anger. Keep learning and keep an open mind. I'll do the same and maybe we'll meet in the middle some day.

Russian interference and Russian collusion are not the same, they are two separate matters entirely. Trump himself would say that Russia interfered in the election in some way. That is pretty well established. Trump colluding with Russia to win the election is what is an inch away from being totally debunked. 


Contemporary Politics
	The World we live in is disproportionally divided into social classes that separate the citizens depending on wealth. The distribution of wealth is drastically advantageous to the wealthy 1%, and dishonest to the other 99% of the working class. There have been countless wars over many unnecessary conflicts regarding economic gain, territorial gain, and religion.
Corruption is a prominent controversy. There are many evident weaknesses in the political systems utilized around the World today in the form of embezzlement, lobbying, patronage, and bribery. 
In Democratic Communism, we, the People, would incorporate Socialistic ideals so that all individuals must work by contributing to society. All are equal, and there is not a hierarchy established by how much materialistic value or political dominance an individual possesses. We would be rewarded by the amount of work we put in towards the benefit of society through karma and the use of the bartering system (food, clothes, absolute necessities) The People must revive the World to the way of nature through the use of windmills, gravity, water pressure, and storing solar energy; this is the healthier alternative than the burning of fossil fuels and pollution. The People must unite to devaluate money, jewelry, and natural resources in order to disallow the on-going violence, corruption, and selfishness over these materialistic objects. The hard-working individuals are the upper class, while those who do not work are the lower class. To desensitize materialism would be to negate the root of all evil.

It seems like it would be simpler to just have SNAP recipients follow to rules for WIC purchases. The guidelines are already in place, the stores are already using the guidelines, just stamp everything that says WIC with SNAP and call it a day.

No need to invent a new job for the USDA, we already have a simple and easy solution ready to go.
Yeah sounds good.

But we definitely need to return to an era of welfare shame instead of breeding entire generations of proud welfare reliance and non productivity
And get rid off the damn welfare subsidies on corn and milk.
I like that. I'd make two changes to make it a little less restrictive, though. First, instead of having to get different things with low limits on how much of any one item, SNAP recipients could pick as much as they want from anything off the list, up to their spending limit. Second, expand the food list a little bit. WIC is designed for young mothers and small children. SNAP recipients include women without children, older children and teenagers, men, and the elderly. This means more variance in dietary needs. Adding some extra choices and letting them pick the amounts lets people customize better.
&gt;Opponents of the cuts also point out that the physical delivery of the food would pose a challenge for the government.

If we only had some type of government run delivery service...hmmm, if only.
And?
That would work scepter when we were on wic, well my wife they gave us so much food we had to give it away else it would waste. They gave us enough eggs and cheese to compete in mr olympia and I would eat the food which is technically not allowed since it's not for me but there was just so much
That delivered packages door to door, dammit why doesn't that exist

Nikolas Cruz belonged to a white supremacist, Florida secessionist group. This tweet is wrong.

How did you get that out of the article? It doesn't mention anything about a middle eastern resist group. The group in question is the Republic of Florida militia, and that's the group Nikola Cruz belonged to.
This tweet is more accurate than not. Almosg all of the recent mass shooters in the US have been registered democrats or left leaning if not registered. I only say almost because I don't speak in absolutes if I don't have to.
Local law enforcement couldn't find any actual ties to the group. But he was subscribed to middle eastern resist groups on social media. You should get information from multiple sources, not only biased ones. Then come to your own conclusions. Otherwise it makes you look uninformed.

Several points to make and then I'll be on my way. First, I said mass shooters and then you listed multiple incidents which weren't purpotrated by a shooter. So you've proven yourself to be either stupid, or a liar. Or probably both. It shows that you had little to back up your point so you were grasping at straws. Secondly, the article you sent listed the KKK as a right wing group, whereas in fact it was started by the democrats. So it's left wing extremism. Thus, I will not be trusting your source as they lied right out the gate to further their agenda. Also, the cute little graph they showed doesn't list the 150 incidents that they conveniently cherry picked to prove their (lack of a) point. It damages the entire articles credibility. The Orlando shooter was a Muslim, so leftist, the Vegas shooter was Democrat, the Virginia tech shooter, the conservative baseball practice shooter, the Virginia tech shooter, the Colorado Dark Knight shooter, the fort hood shooter, the columbine shooters, the navy yard shooter, all progressive liberal/democrats. The list goes on man. Your little "sources" didn't mention them. Do some real research and don't just trust the media, because they have agendas. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions. Have a good day.

Wow man, I asked not to sling names and insults, and you can't even make a polite post? You can't even be bothered to read past the second article either? People are more receptive to new information when you don't insult them from the get-go.

If you're so correct in your views, then why don't you post where you're getting your information, and news sources that support your views.

Best regards.
All of your sources are proven liberal outlets. They have an agenda and you're falling for it. They didn't wait for the facts because they want to change people's minds, not inform and let people make up their own minds. The fact that you even included Huffington Post probes that you have a terrible sense in what a good source is. That would be like me trying to prove a point and listing Infowars as my source. It just can't be trusted until you properly vet the information. And as for the links to middle eastern groups, that's all available on his social media. You can look that up yourself because I'm too lazy to right now, if I'm being completely honest. But it's out there. Just some friendly advice, look around at various sources and make up your own mind before you trust the first thing you see. It'll save you trouble. Have a good day. 
I didn't sling any names, I just made a statement. Based on what you gave me to go on, I came to the conclusion. That's all man. The fact that you're trying to use that as an escape route makes me even more confident in my conclusion. Facts presented, and you turn and run. It's nothing new to me. Carry on. 
Also, I must apologize because I didn't realize both of those responses I had in my inbox were from you originally, so in responding to this one I didn't take into account the special request on the other comment. But I hold true to my original statement. Carry on. 
You are aware most of your sources are owned by the same few people correct?  All the media companies that exist bar a hand full are owned by 6 groups (and shrinking). If an agenda is pushed it will be presented on multiple fronts.

As to his Syrian resistance groups, it was first reported by Fox News, but here’s a few sources. 

http://amp.dailycaller.com/2018/02/14/florida-shooter-syrian-groups/

http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/active-shooter-reported-at-florida-high-school/news-story/49c0266125e20ee3d1fd7d0233966bb5

https://www.dailywire.com/news/27160/suspected-gunman-florida-school-shooting-ryan-saavedra


At any rate, if you actually care beyond the evidence spouted by the same few sources, do some research. 
The KKK is unquestionably a right wing group. Democrats have not always been the left wing of this country, and the Democrats who created the KKK were right wing. Don’t tell others to go research something when you clearly haven’t done your own research to begin with. 
If you're going to bring up this big "switch" that you believe happened, please at least have some proper information to back it up. When do you believe the switch happened?
Also, if the KKK is so right wing, why would Hillary Clinton, a prominent leftist, admire a former KKK member so highly? Robert Byrd is who I'm referring to, of course. 
I included sources from multiple parts of the spectrum, yes even Huffington Post, for accuracy. The Pew Research Center considers CBS to be centrist. Reuters and LA Times fall in the middle, and New York Post falls center-right according to www.mediabiasfactcheck.com

Do you have a link showing that he belonged to middle eastern resistance groups? I would like to read it. If I'm to arrive at the same conclusions as you, I need to see the same material that lead you to your conclusion.
Before I answer that, let me ask you this: what objective attributes would you say go along with progressive/left-wing ideology, and conservative/right-wing ideology? 
So all of your sources are either "center" or far left? You need to expand a little man. 
And like I said, I can't be bothered right now but it's out there. I'm too lazy to post links, I just repeat what I hear and expect other people to find stuff themselves like I did. I'm a terrible debater because proving what I know takes time and I'm lazy and prefer to laugh at people. Sorry for wasting your time if you don't want to believe me.
Okay, that's one. Are there any others?
Alright, so there's a possibility he might be a member of a Syrian resistance group. How does that negate being in a white supremacist group?
No, New York Post falls center right. And as far as being unbiased, being center means you're not biased towards either side. Sources that fall in the center are least biased and thus the best sources of information. I did find an article on Breitbart that supports that he belonged to white nationalist groups, if you're interested though.

http://www.breitbart.com/news/school-shooting-suspect-belonged-to-white-nationalist-group/

And once again, I would like to see your sources that lead you to your conclusion. You're asking me for a lot of "proof" but haven't backed up your side with any links supporting your claims.

As I believe you already know, Robert Byrd had already left the Ku Klux Klan in the 40s. Clinton was born in 47. He spent the last 2/3rds of his lifetime regretting his involvement in it and his other early racist positions after becoming a Baptist. Clinton is allowed to admire someone who recognized his wrongs and attempted to amend them best he could. Your statement lacks nuance, which I also suspect you know, and sound much more like a talking point than anything that could lead to an actual discussion. 
I have taken the time to give you links and you can't do the same? Then how do I replicate your results? If you can't back up your view with a similar amount of links, I can't validate what you're saying.
Jesus Christ, stop reading tweets and do your homework on this stuff.

Because the whole point of a Syrian resistance group is that it is established against western civilization.  You can't be both pro white supremacy and against it at the same time.

As the demographics shift, the party and its positions will shift to match, just as it always has been, and always shall be.  The Democratic Party of the early 20th century must have been panicking over the decline of farmers as a voting block as technology progressed, seeing groups that voted against them grow in proportion, while the farmers took up less of a part of the pie.

Democrats still exist today because there are forces beyond parties that point towards an ebb and flow of power between a dual party system.  The Republican Party of tomorrow will likely be very different, made up of a different kind of coalition of different voting groups than the Party of today.  How the winning coalition is assembled determines the policy positions of a party, and both can easily change on a dime.
They lack the upper body strength to handle handguns and rifles, so they would be better off with crew-served weapons.  Bonus: Operating these weapons encourages teamwork.

Thomas Friedman has lost his mind. Seriously... according to his opening paragraph, there are two options: 

1) Trump is compromised by the Russians

2) Trump is a fool

That's it. Those are the two options that bear any consideration. 

It's all pegged on the hope that **something** will come up showing collusion. This despite the fact that tens of thousands of people have been pouring over everything they can find for over 13 months. Not just the feds, but rabid MSM journalists who would give their first-born for any evidence of collusion. There hasn't been anything. 
Exactly. You won't, because you're lying.

Mueller's team has either indicted or gotten guilty pleas from 19 people and three companies so far, I wouldn't say "there hasn't been anything". The only reason nothing has been brought to light about Trump yet is because they are still conducting the investigation so you won't hear anything about Trump being innocent or guilty until the investigating part is almost over. Not to mention 13 months is really fast paced for everything that has been brought to light in any other POTUS investigations. 
&gt; Mueller's team has either indicted or gotten guilty pleas from 19 people and three companies so far, I wouldn't say "there hasn't been anything". 

If you take away the folks associated with the Russian bot case, you are left with **four**. Two of these four (Manafort and Gates) were indicted in connection with activities associated with Ukraine (not Russia) taking place *before the election*. I have no problem with the indictments, but they do not establish a Russia "collusion" case (whatever that would be). 

The remaining two are George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn. Both plead guilty to making false statements to the FBI (not collusion). Specifically, [Flynn plead guilty](https://www.justice.gov/file/1015126/download) to making false statements regarding his conversations with the Russian Ambassador to the United States, during the transition period in December 2016. [Papadopoulos plead guilty](https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download) to making false statements regarding his conversations with a UK professor and a "female Russian national" Papadopoulos wrongly believed could introduce him to folks in the Russian government who had dirt on Clinton. 

There was nothing illegal about Flynn's or Papadopoulos' actions, except with respect to the *investigation itself.* These are called [process crimes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1279681)... crimes not *uncovered* by the investigation, but *created* by the investigation. 

In other words... no collusion. 

&gt; The only reason nothing has been brought to light about Trump yet is because they are still conducting the investigation so you won't hear anything about Trump being innocent or guilty until the investigating part is almost over. 

This is an investigation, not a tribunal. We won't "hear anything" about *anyone's* guilt or innocence because investigators do not determine those things. 

Furthermore, this investigation (and the FBI generally) have been leakier than the Titanic. If there was a shred of evidence pointing to collusion, it would be out there by now. Instead, we get an indictment against 13 Russians (who can't even be arrested since they are currently in Russia). 

&gt; Not to mention 13 months is really fast paced for everything that has been brought to light in any other POTUS investigations. 

Sure, if you only compare it to the investigations initiated under the now-defunct Ethics in Government Act (the "Independent Counsel Law"). Dig into this [FiveThirtyEight piece](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mueller-is-moving-quickly-compared-to-past-special-counsel-investigations/), which does just that. 

The Ethics in Government Act was allowed to lapse in 1999, in part because of how drawn-out, politicized and "inquisitorial" [the process had become](https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/1999_jul_aug_anderson.html). And yet here we are once again. 

I'm sure the investigation will continue at least through the 2018 midterm elections, because why not? 














"First, @RepTenney said Democrats are un-American. Now this. This toxic rhetoric is shameful and a new low even for Ms. Tenney," Brindisi‏ wrote on Twitter. "Inserting politics into a national tragedy is beyond the pale &amp; disgusting. She should apologize now to spare our region any more national embarrassment."
yet again you still think you know everything about the case when nothing about COLLUSION has been released yet because the investigation isn't over and you won't hear anything about it until it's over. What about that do you not get? You can post links all you want and write as many paragraphs as you want it doesn't change the fact that no one knows until the investigation is done. The 19 people and the 3 companies are still part of the investigation so you can't just say they don't count because yes they do. So again you are wrong I wouldn't say they have "nothing" like you claimed.
Liberalism is a mental disorder.
What about homeless people? Where will they store food?
&gt; ...nothing about COLLUSION has been released yet because the investigation isn't over and you won't hear anything about it until it's over.

That's the beauty of it! So long as the investigation continues, folks like you can hold out hope that there is a "there there," amidst this "nothingburger" of a case. 

Here's the thing... the government cannot launch investigations and issue subpoenas unless they *already* have probable cause to do so. You can't go *looking* for probable cause. You either have it or you don't. 

There is an old quote attributed to [Lavrentiy Beria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavrentiy_Beria), who was the head of the secret police (NKVD) under Joseph Stalin: 

&gt; "show me the man, I'll show you the crime." 

[The idea being](http://reason.com/archives/2012/07/25/america-the-law-crazed) that if you dig far enough and work long enough, you can eventually find *something* to pin on them. 

There is another idea out there that [the average American commits three felonies a day](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704471504574438900830760842). 

If that's really the case, why aren't we **all** under investigation, and why aren't we **all** being prosecuted? 

The point is that this investigation amounts to a year-long fishing expedition. I have no doubt that they will find *something*, since that's what lawyers are supposed to do. Whether or not it has anything remotely to do with "collusion" is another story. 

Researchers can't even closely estimate [how many crimes are listed in the U.S. criminal code](https://www.nacdl.org/criminaldefense.aspx?id=34478). You, me, Trump, Clinton, your parents and grandparents, hell, even your unborn children, have already broken dozens of these laws. 

In spite of this, there isn't actually a single law defining or outlawing "collusion," the principle "charge" of the investigation. I find that incredible. 



Folks like Me? Lol that's funny because you don't know a single thing about me without looking at my Reddit info. I bet my left nut you can't tell weather I'm a Democrat or a Republican. I'll give you a hint... This is a Republican page. So you think "people like me" will hold out on hope? That's funny. That's almost as funny as Trump saying we are going to start using clean coal. 

In the end of this conversation it all comes down to this. When it comes to talking about the collusion, you don't know squat, I don't know squat, Trump doesn t know squat, and it will be like that until the investigation is over. I will agree with you that it will take a while for the investigation to even come close to an end as they usually do as seen over the past investigations of presidents, but you can't just sit here and tell me that no collusion has been found just because it's not being reported. That's not how these investigations work. And don't even get me started on that "nothing burger" comment because that's  fake news right there and your a total moron if you think otherwise. 
This is such a false equivalency. As if their personal choice of spending $5 on a coffee is why people aren’t millionaires.

That author is definitely living in an anti-Trump echo chamber and even though he gives Trump credit, he still misses the fact that the "scandals" he thinks the majority of the American people care about have become proof of the media's bias against Trump.

"Russiagate" is hilarious.  Not only is there no proof whatsoever that Trump colluded with Russia, but we now know that the DNC and Clinton Campaign we're the ones actually colluding with Russians to beat Trump.

There is such joy when thinking about all of the assholes who called Trump supporters traitors while voting for Clinton.  Now that is some serious egg on the face.
Apparently it wasnt clear. I thought I already answered that by posting Anthony Brindisi's response. Yes, Tenney is wrong. Shithead politicians like her are dividing this country even further.

What is this picture supposed to mean exactly 
Likely drawing attention to the fact that one of Trump’s slogans, ‘America First’ was also used by the KKK
But that's such a common phrase. 
Yeah, but they're desperate, and the Russia thing totally fell apart and backfired. He's doing incredibly well and they need something to cry about. 
It's a liberal throwaway account and as UncontroversialTweet said

&gt;Desperate
I wouldn’t say the Russia thing totally fell apart or backfired. I also wouldn’t say this is a fair post by OP
He went beyond what they wanted. Setting aside due process until after the government has taken the guns?
I mean it's been 2 years of dumping all the resources America has at it's disposal into this thing, and the only things they've proven were that democrats colluded with foreign governments and weaponized the DoJ. Considering this all started as Trump being Putin's puppet and they worked together to steal the election, I'd say it fell apart and backfired. 
When someone gets arrested they get taken to jail before their trial. 

We already suspend due process. You secure the situation first, and the deal with the legal process.
I think there’s a difference between the investigation and the spin. The mandate is investigating more than the idea of collusion, which is a hazy term to begin with. I think America is better for uncovering the likely crimes of Paul Manafort and the Russian troll operation, which was about sowing confusion and not necessary supporting one side. These tactics will spread and the don’t care if there’s a D or an R next to the name.
[deleted]
Look at this guys post history. Gotta be a troll of some kind. There have been 13 indictments, and idk how many guilty pleas of hand, I’m responding to a troll and don’t wanna look up the numbers. 

This admin at all times screams no collusion and yet at every turn does exactly what a guilty person would do.
They also get a chance to ask for bail and challenge charges prior to trial as well, part of the process, due process. If 'due process' is ignored because someone 'thinks' or 'assumes' someone will do something 'evil' the end will not justify the means.
So we agree. You arrest people first, evaluate the situation, then let due process play out.
With an issued arrest warrant which was obtained with legal probable cause/evidence.

The ends do not justify the means.
The ends absolutely justify the means sometimes. 

You would lie to a terrorist to save your family, even though lying is wrong.
Lying is wrong, not illegal. When talking about due process and/or lack there of the ends don't justify the means. 
None of the indictments were in any way connected to both Trump and Russia. The ones related to Trump had nothing to do with Russian collusion during the elections, and the ones related to Russian collusion, the 13 you're referring to, had nothing to do with Trump. If I'm a troll, you're losing a debate of facts with a troll. That's embarrassing. 
When someone gets arrested a warrant has been issued or they were caught in the act of committing a crime. Due process has not been suspended. The president, who was elected as a Republican, is talking about violating the constitutionally protected rights of Americans.
Are you saying that people with guns are terrorists?
First sentence: None of the indictments were connected to Trump/Russia.

Second sentence: The indictments that related to Trump......

Killing it. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
You apparently can't read. I said none of the indictments were related to BOTH Trump and Russia. As in some were related to Trump, some were related to Russia, but none of them had them both in common. Learn to read, and also whoever upvoted that probably feels embarrassed. 
Actually lying can illegal depending on the situation so saying it's not illegal is completely wrong.
But he has not done anything.  Trump has demonstrated this negotiating tactic again and again, and even included it in his books.  Take an extreme position so that when you get what you want the other side thinks they won.  In this case the other side are Republicans who do not want to compromise on gun reform at all.
IF 'lying' is listed as an infraction as part of a process ie 'the law' it is a crime such as fraud or perjury. One either adheres to a process or not. Ignoring the process or due process for political expediency is an example of using the ends to justify the means. The ends don't justify the means.
To expand on that, a warrant requires “probable cause” that that person committed a crime. It’s not a very high bar. The only way I can see this being constitutional is if the level of scrutiny required prior to temporarily taking away any guns is something akin to probable cause.

The investigation is nowhere near concluded. And [two years](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mueller-is-moving-quickly-compared-to-past-special-counsel-investigations/) is nothing for a special counsel, leaving aside the fact that Mueller has barely had 9 and a half months. 
The investigation should be concluded, and an apology should be in order for the president, because it's been proven over and over that the democrats and rinos were the ones that colluded to stop him. The special counsel was started because of the dossier which was proven to be illegally obtained and based on no merit. 
Oh sorry, Rep. Nunes, I didn't realize it was you. Have you spoken to [Rep. Gowdy](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/rep-trey-gowdy-on-mueller-indictments-this-is-exactly-what-we-wanted-him-to-do/) recently? 
This is race distribution and it shows that the hispanic american population is growing over immigration. I think OP’s point is invalid as race politics dies out more every year that goes by.  For example - My (asian) family is all conservative regardless of race politics.
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I respect Gowdy more than the next conservative, but when it comes to this investigation, I stay true to my belief that it's a waste of time, resources and taxpayer dollars.
Humor us. If Trump is truly innocent, the subject of a vast international smear campaign, we will owe him an apology for it. But as for things we do know: Russia used several avenues to influence or threaten our elections, all of which must be tightened up. Trump-appointed CIA director Pompeo agrees. I'll set aside which direction Russia wants to push our elections and simply say that our election integrity is important to every American. Voter registration systems and electronic voting booths must be hardened, there's no evidence that the Russians did tamper there, but they certainly had access to key systems, which is inexcusable. Foreign funding directed to influence our elections must be stamped out, and Mueller is certainly on the case there. It's my sincere opinion that Citizens United must be overturned and the FEC should be overhauled and given fangs, but regardless of whether you agree with those, the steps outlined above should be common sense. 

In my opinion, Mueller has earned his funding through his work so far. Whether or not he is right to investigate the President, he has found and started prosecution of crimes that no one else was working on. And the cost to taxpayers is not very significant, the first 4.5 months cost about $6.7 million according to the DoJ, expanding that out to today the cost is likely around $15 million. Compared to the expenses of Trump playing golf at Mar a Lago since the inauguration, which total about $56 million, I think this is very reasonable. If Trump deems that much spending on whatever he does there reasonable, no matter how it appears to the press and public, I hope we can be humored in keeping Mueller around at a much smaller cost. 
He actually gets work done when he plays golf, so I'm fine with that. And as far as the election integrity goes, yeah, it's important to get it cleaned up, but that goes for everything. Including other countries that also tried to influence our election. Not just the Russians. 
I would respect this a lot more if Mueller did the right thing and admitted that this isn't a real investigation into Trump himself. It's an investigation into Russian meddling, which Trump has no proven ties to at the moment. If something comes up, then sure call it an investigation into President Trump. Until then, his name needs to be removed from the suspects, otherwise it is a smear campaign, and a complete witch hunt. 
Finally. Gawd the judicial idiocy today. 
Great idea, but poor platform choice.

I heard that Bush boy wants to change the Alamo, make it less about the war or some crap. 
The only people dumb enough to believe in a "blue wave" are the ones dumb enough to vote for a party that has a platform where illegal immigrants deserve more than native born Americans, that you don't deserve more of the money you work for, and that everyone who doesn't agree with them is a racist and a bigot.

Democrats shut down the government to give illegals amnesty.

Not a single Democrat voted for tax cuts and they just put forth a plan to raise taxes.

The Democratic Party's candidate for the presidency literally called people bigots, racists, xenophobic deplorables.

You don't seem to know your own party's platform which is typical for useful idiots.

Ask Boeing how they feel about that! They stand to lose a trillion dollars worth of business in a trade war with China.
Boeing's one of the companies that is happy to let China to steal technology. Like pretty much all of these businesses, they could care less about the long term consequences of what they're doing. It's about damned time someone gets tough on China! 
I bet they are concerned about their stock prices. 11% of an airplane is steel. Aluminum and aluminum alloys are a big part of planes. This will only increase the price of their product. 
By the time Trump is finished granting exceptions the tariffs will pretty much just apply to China, the guys who cheat at everything. 
Huge mistake. Go for it!
China policy has been one enormous mistake since the Nixon Administration. Perhaps the biggest and most catastrophic mistake in the history of our nation. 

A new approach to the PRC is long overdue. 
Go for it! 
Bipartisan consensus is to in fact go for it. Not inside the beltway, but with the voters. It's one of the reasons that crackpot Bernie Sanders was a more popular candidate with the Democrat party's base than "Crooked" Hillary Clinton. 

Trump's making the Bushes, Clinton, and Obama out to be the corporate stooges that they really were. People who put the interests of the few ahead of the interests of the overwhelming majority of Americans, who put short term economic gains ahead of America's long-term interests. It's sad!

Do you fail to see the trap in the contradiction presented?  

Or is it that both sides sound condescending from my remark, even though we don't feel any shame in feeding it that way to others?

We have lost our ability to treat others the way we would wish to be treated.  That does't make us good people, it doesn't support our beliefs, and it doesn't make America great again.

I hope our warmer relations with Taiwan inspire others who are currently living under Communist China to rebel against the dictatorship and their stupid islands in the South China Sea sink. 
President Trump knows what he's doing. Time after time the media and the democrats and even the republicans doubt him, but he ends up being right. The election, Obamacare, tax cuts, ISIS, just to name a few. I have no doubts anymore that anything he does is going to work out. 
His predecessors left a much bigger mess than most people really realize. There's so much for him to fix. China's arguably the biggest problem of them all. It's very sad what our leaders did over the past few decades, selling the future of the world to Communist China. 
As Bad As China is, I'd say there's worse things. But he's fixing all of them. It's honestly unbelievable how much he's done in such a short time while being constantly attacked and smeared. 
Man I love that feeling when I think all the comments in the thread are from left wing brigadiers and end up being actual civil discussion among republicans. Nobody for me to ban here.
I love seeing real conservatives in the Republicans thread. My last experience here was really bad. 
Actually, the more I sit and think about it, you're right. China has probably been the biggest thorn in our side, or certainly for the longest time. It's a disgrace the position our leaders have put us in. But I still firmly believe that the person to get us out of it is Donald Trump. Even if you don't like him on a personal level, I think every sane person will eventually come to the realization that he's exactly what we needed.

The bill helps validate globalism as well giving data to foreign governments by 'agreement' rather than search warrants or court orders which probably circumvent more than US law.

Traitors
These people are the worst. Vote all of them out.
I don't like how the article politicizes a simple gun show.  As a pro-gun lib,  not everyone fits the gop/dem mold and it kind of sucks seeing something so uniquely American, become so polarizing.  This goes for the NRA as well.  I would prefer them not to get into politics and just be advocates for safe, and responsible gun ownership. 
The benefits of regulatory reform are numerous and well-documented. In a recent report on “The Growth Potential of Deregulation,” the Council of Economic Advisors conservatively estimated that excessive regulation cost the U.S. an average of 0.8 percent of gross domestic product growth per year since 1980.

The video report, based on Diane Katz's piece for Geopolitical Intelligence Services (GIS).

I agree the extreme right and left are both trash. But its fun to watch them clash sometimes haha 
McBerniebro banned for violation of our third fucking sentence ffs. Some just make it easy for us....
Yeah.  That thing was ridiculous!  Why did Trump even sign it?  I’d have said, “This is ridiculous.  No one has had time to read this.  It would be unconscionable for anyone to sign something this big that no one could possibly have read.”  

He shouldn’t have said,”This is the last time I’m going ti sign something like this.”

Not that I know the whole story, though.  What am I missing?  Why did he even sign it?
Pro gun lib here.  This kind of talk does not help.  This is not an "us" against "them" paradigm.  Gun ownership is woven in the fabric of this nation and this rhetoric divides.  There is enough that we disagree on there has to be a middle somewhere. I wish the NRA just concentrated on responsible and safe gun ownership rather than politics. It's the reason I gave up my membership. Thoughts?
WTF.  There is so much wrong with this but on top of the nice raise that they gave themselves, [the Cloud act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/responsibility-deflected-cloud-act-passes) is just a thunderclap of stupid.

The butthurt is very strong with them.  They can only watch as Trump dismantles their golden boys legacy piece by piece.  It's wonderful.
How is this related to being Republican?
Well, if Politicians can be bought, Trump is buying.
And because one thinks they can save lives he should be accepted at schools like UCLA ahead other qualified or better applicants?

 Is Hogg someone who is saving lives or just another bratty college kid when he publicly expresses his disappointment of the results of college applications/school he desires to attend.
Saving lives by attacking the NRA?  The safest group of gun owners in the world and attacking them is saving lives?  That guy is a twat.

He's either too stupid to realize he's being used as a pawn by the Democratic Party, which should have been obvious to anyone involved when they saw who the organizers were.  Or he knowingly is being a pawn of the Democratic Party and he's doing it to further his own ambitions.


He's a bully with an agenda https://youtu.be/8aYUOqZrhos
It’s the second thing 

He is the same psych profile of Hitler 

Expect to see more of him because he will screech to be relevant as much as he can 
He bullied a kid to mass murder but he wants to save lives? Interesting.
I don't know about all of that but he is a twat.
This. It's also becoming clearer and clearer that the shooting was a false flag, and likely never even happened. 
He's worse than hitler imo. 
Families should sue him for murdering their children by proxy. He knew what he was doing. 
McCabe is a treasonous traitor 
Wtf
And now, with the media's assistance, he's publicly bullying anyone who disagrees with him at all. 
It's fair to call him a fascist but unless some experts sat down with him and came to this conclusion saying that he has the same psych profile as Hitler is just dumb. 
Hitler was also a non performer who seized on a momentum to gain power and had the same psycho eyes
Hitler Hogg
Could you post a source for him bullying the Parkland school shooter?  I've seen this claim around - including Emma Gonzalez as well - but haven't seen or been able to find any corroboration. 
i approve
That makes no sense.
If saving lives is the goal, they all need to turn in thier keys.
It's a known truth 
If reincarnation is true, it's likely that he IS hitler 
You misspelled "As the Democrats did on federal judges, and the Republicans just extended when they took back power".
okay

Response?  Republicans didn't start this race to the bottom, but they took it to its logical conclusion.  Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, after all.
Are you really comparing a teenager who is exercising their First Amendment rights to someone who was responsible for the murder of millions of people and paved the way for a war that we still feel the effects of till this day? Or were Hitler’s atrocities a false flag too?

That review makes zero sense.  It's not really even clear what he's angry about.  Is he angry that the antagonists are right-wing, religious extremists?

I literally have no idea what he's angry about.

The problem with this type of review is that it ignores all the great things the game does and focuses only on whatever the hell it is the author is angry about. Really hard to take these kinds of reviews seriously. It’s too one-sided.
According to the article this cost the state $141 million across 3 years. 

That's $47 million a year. California has a population of 39 million people. So that's about a $1.20/year per citizen. A dollar twenty a year to improve the lives of over a million people.

Pretty sure Trump already knows Syria is terrible
Trump: "Well, we're doing the BEST, trust me, the BEST we can to help you all... after all, this year, under my presidency, we took in a whopping 11 refugees!  I mean, you can't make these numbers up, people... highest refugee from Syria numbers ever!
Barack Obama allowed in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, but I assure you people, Syria wasn't sending their best a brightest.  They were sending the criminals and rapists.  
But trust, I really really care about you; you can tell because I am saying so with my mouth.  
Barack Obama would never have cared about you this much.

And prosecutors across the country frequently do. It's a matter of winning, not justice. This an example of why it takes 20-30 years of appeals and DNA to pull people off of death row even the evidence and questions were there early in the case/investigation.
There US takes in more refugees than any other country.  The US accounts for almost half of all refugees resettlements.

The US can't fix the entire world by itself, and can't just have a policy of letting everyone who wants to leave shithole countries into the US.
Good
It's not Trump to worry about, it's Jeff Sessions.  He's rabidly anti-pot.
The US can’t just have that policy *anymore, now that I exist and live there*, you mean. 
It wasn't a problem before.  Since WWII, refugees haven't been significant.  The number of refugees, particularly from non-western countries, is increasing, and Western countries increasingly don't want them because they are largely a liability.

So technically, we've never had that policy, we've basically just been tricked and pushed to take more and more refugees.
&gt; The average annual refugee ceiling since the 1980 Refugee Act exceeds 95,000. President Barack Obama set a refugee admissions target of 110,000 for 2017. In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would slash that number by more than half, citing unfounded fears that terrorists may infiltrate the refugee resettlement program.

Do you mind if I ask what your project is?
Sure thing. It is an open-ended research project on an issue of my choosing, and I chose to look at political engagement, communication, and trust. The goal is to write a thesis that either confirms or undermines my hypothesis (that there is a disconnect between what the electorate wants and what actions congress takes) through preexisting research and my own.
Interesting project! That said, if I was a university professor (I'm not nor do I have a degree beyond a BS, so take it with a grain of salt), I'm not sure I'd look very favorably on any conclusions drawn from survey data collected from Reddit (especially responses primarily acquired in party-specific subs like /r/democrats or /r/republicans). I'd stick to public opinion polling from reputable sources like Pew and Gallup and Congressional voting records. Of course it's not my project so of course the call is yours. Good luck!
Honestly, I agree with you. My professor wanted us to have an exercise in crafting a survey and drawing conclusions from the results, including their validity. It isn't a survey course, more of an exercise in creating and analyzing information
Gotcha! Carry on then :)
Would you be able to let us see the results?
sure, I could post the results after it seems like the responses dwindle
Cool, thanks. It's always  interesting to see the results of a survey.

So anyone that has anything bad to say even if they are Republican or not you will deal with them, got it! 
actually he'll need the Nobel Prize committee's approval,. They're over in Europeland BTW.  Pelosi is correct in that the criteria for awarding the prize are quite vague, a couple of sentences if I recall, so pretty much every person on the planet 'qualifies'.  I'd invite you to look this up , but Trumpets are idiots who don't trust anything but whatever Trump shits directly into your mouth. Apart from the criteria Your toddler king doesn't merit or deserve the prize  of course. It will probably go to a another brown person like the president of SK or China.  Queue your idiot cries of 'but Obama' lol. 

Would you like to point out where I have said this?

having critical opinions if you are a republican is helpful, if you are attacking the sub as a non republican you are straight up violating the rules.
Lol at the most I comment and state actual facts and yet I get told I'm just a liberal and to get out of the sub so I'm sorry if I sound a bit forward but it's all I've gotten in this sub

This was just a concern to me as of late based on many recent headlines. I’m a gay dude usually imagine myself as leftward, but I can appreciate that we should unite on specific issues wherever that’s possible (And I do). People are so stupidly tribal these days.

I mean slavery was a choice after all.  /s  I don't think most Dem's or anyone else really cares about his liking Trump.  It's his idiocy that people have issues with.
Noko is being solved by soko (and he may not give up the nukes anyways!), and everything else you mentioned really was already on the rise with obama. Trump totally lit a fire under stocks, gdp, etc. though.
But keep track of the conversation: democrats have LOADS more to run on than just the porn star crap. Trump has made too many controversies and embarrassments to choose from. And if he screws up with the tariff strategy we could lose the stock market/gdp gains.
Another way of saying they got a good gig and no one should deflate their bubble.
&gt;Noko is being solved by soko

Nope. Trump did this, even according to soko. I'm sorry reality conflicts with your cogdis.

&gt;and everything else you mentioned really was already on the rise with obama.

"MUHBAMA!!" rofl. As if the market and unemployment are linear.

Yeah, things were in a positive trend towards the end of Obama's presidency and he gets credit for that.

The market and current unemployment numbers have nothing to do with a past president, however, and everything to do with optimism under Trump.

&gt; democrats have LOADS more to run on

Yes and no. They'll surely come up with tons of stuff to run on, but the only tangible policy they have to run on is "impeach drumpf" - the economy is doing great and foreign policy is going swimmingly.

Well, they can run on allowing illegal immigrants free reign. We'll see how that goes.

&gt;Trump has made too many controversies and embarrassments to choose from

Not in the real world

&gt;And if he screws up with the tariff strategy we could lose the stock market/gdp gains.

Maybe

This is only because April was tax collecting month.  Our annual budget is still at a Trillion Dollar Deficit.
Still a good sign because increased economic activity and wage increases led to billions more in revenue.

"The federal government realized a surplus of $218 billion in April 2018, CBO estimates—**$35 billion larger than the surplus in April 2017.**

**CBO estimates that receipts in April 2018 totaled $515 billion—$59 billion (or 13 percent) more than those in the same month last year**. Individual income and payroll taxes rose by $73 billion (or 20 percent), on net. Nonwithheld payments for those taxes, largely final payments of 2017 taxes, rose by $60 billion. Withholding of individual income and payroll taxes rose by $7 billion (or 4 percent). **Withheld taxes rose both because wages and salaries were higher** and because April 2018 had one more business day than April 2017. However, those factors were partially offset because the share of wages withheld for taxes was lower, CBO estimates, reflecting the new withholding tables issued in January. Corporate income tax payments declined by $14 billion (or 24 percent)."
I’m pretty sure everyone expected short term gains? I’m more interested in 2 to 5 years from now...
Short term gains?  The economy has been growing for awhile now and wage growth has been increasing overall since Trump was elected.  Our economy has boomed since Trump was elected abd he's making pro-growth moves so what's giving you the impression that we are headed for declines?


You can not really believe that... The actions of the past are coming to fruition today. Its like saying Clinton was the reason for the boom in 90s... 
What actions if the past?

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/economists-credit-trump-as-tailwind-for-u-s-growth-hiring-and-stocks-1515682893

There is no denying his tax cuts and bravado has had a short term impact on stocks and polls. But those are the most fickle measures.

The economy was brought back from the brink with quantitative easing and with bailing out banks etc and recouping the costs. 

Those factors coupled with very low interest rates and favorable recovery speed vs the rest of the world. Poised the run up we are currently seeing. 

A presidents job is so large there impacts are not felt for 3-4 years after the signatures and policies. Also the regular cycling of the economy is not directly tied to their administration. 



Also for all the “good” QE did it’s just a time bomb.  Corporate debt and irrational exuberance for the housing market are the looming problems that cure created.

I think Candace Owens is amazing and love what she's doing. 

It's disappointing, though, that we had to resort to someone who fits her description in order to spread the "message". In this country you can not be a specific gender or race and have her type of ideologies  and not be called misogynistic or racist. This type of narrow-minded thinking is killing relations between the parties.

It won't be too long before she is called a racist just like Ben Shapiro being called a Nazi even though he is Jewish.

Republican here.  I imagine I have a fairly common viewpoint on the right, which is that some environmental regulations are necessary, but many are not, as they were ineffective to begin with or have outlived their usefulness. Given the benefits that fracking provides as a source of oil, I think it's overall worth it to allow the action, provided that we hold corporations accountable to clean up any and all messes made.
Ug, Being a Republican Environmental Scientist is hard somedays. Your questions seemed too simple to answer because every situation is different and there are a lot of complexities. I tried my best, sorry if I wrecked the curve.

I know, it would just be a bit more credible to just use her name. Just looks silly which is going to make people dismiss it. 
True, but if they read the article it has the video where she said that. 
Yeah, I hate that she's saying that. I don't think a majority of Americans are against the idea of a woman president...they just don't want HER as a president. 
So TRUE!

IMHO, the Dept of Commerce is the first one that should be completely axed.  It's literally just corporate handouts and cushy bureaucrat jobs at this point.
Is the death penalty still on the table?
Why does r/republicans always bash on Trump? He repaired relations in China, is actually working to protect the second amendment, ended the Korean war (which South Korea majorly credits him to helping with), has acted on illeagle immigration, and even got North Korea to take down nuclear test facilities, in addition to making major progress against ISIS. Not only did he do all those things but he's still the president and should be treated with respect. I thought Obama was horrible, but he still deserves respect. Why should Trump be treated any differently?

Any decent person of any political persuasion should be horrified at people willing to use emotions surrounding the holocaust like this. Things like this are what is killing the blue wave.
We need to start seriously throwing these arguments back on the accuser. This is akin to calling Jews a violent criminal gang. 
That was my immediate thought. Is the author suggesting a mortifying violent gang is the same people of Jewish decent!?
Are they really this partisan or are they just that stupid?

Anyone with a 6th grade education should understand the difference between a metaphor and employing a word for its literal meaning \(of course, today, people seem to think "literally" means "totally."\) Trump employed a metaphor when he called MS\-13 animals and he did so to illustrate the savagery of their morality and their behavior.

By contrast, Hitler and the Nazis genuinely believed that Jews and people of color were *literally* a biologically inferior variety of Homo sapiens. Defenders of slavery and Jim Crow in America felt the same way. Such beliefs were used to justify unfavorable treatment of *law abiding* citizens. Contrast that with MS\-13, who are brutal and heartless killers, rapists, and torturers. They *deserve* to be publicly shamed, arrested, and deported.

And I don't like to be rude, but if you can't see the difference, you have your head deeply up your ass.

The Democratic party is in some serious trouble. They’ve lost double digit leads against the Republicans that they had in December. Democrats are running out of money and failing in a society where people are waking up faster and faster to their agenda.
During 2020 I wouldn’t be surprised if they ran on “impeach trump”. CNN: President elect Maxine Waters, now that you have won the election, what are some of the plans you have set forth for us?” Maxine: “I WILL IM PEACH MINTS DRUMPF”
I’ve heard it takes a super long time to get an appointment in Canada with this system, is that true?
Depends on what the appointment is for (keep in mind I am not a healthcare specialist). If it is a specialist procedure hospitals will triage (assign priority) people based on overall health, need, and availability of hospital personnel (similar to how an emergency room will triage patients based on how badly they are hurt, and what other type of patients there are and the availability of medical personnel). So some procedures and treatments can take a while to get an appointment. But unless it is something VERY specialized the worst I have heard on the news is two to three weeks, and provincial health departments and their federal counterpart are continually working to improve access.

In Canada we have what is called the Canada Health Act (we aren't a very imaginative people when it comes to naming laws) which was passed in the 1980s, and two of the principles of the law are that healthcare across the country must be equivalent and portable. So if my health insurance comes from British Columbia and I am in Nova Scotia (other side of the country), and I need to go to a hospital my BC health care card is good enough for me to get medical treatment without the hospital needing to ask for permission. If I move to another province there is a time period (varies between each province, some it is 60 days, others it is 90) where I need to file paperwork with the provincial government of my new province to transfer over to their healthcare system. But in Canadian provinces we try and make things very simple and efficient for day-to-day needs. I see on American TV how people spend a whole day at their local DMV to file some simple paperwork for a drivers licence, in my province I have not spent more than 20 min waiting for my turn to process documents out of our equivalent of the DMV - and that included a recent change in medical and government service cards that came out (the provincial government combined a few of our government service cards into one card), and I got a letter in the mail telling me to do it between such and such a date, and the whole thing took at most an hour (including travel time).

As for GPs (general practitioners aka family doctors) I have never had a problem getting an appointment at a walk-in clinic - the most I have waited is two or three days AT MOST to get an appointment with a GP. The most I have ever had to pay is for prescriptions, and most of those do not go over $100 CAD. You will have to make appointments if you have a registered family doctor, but that is again not a huge problem. We are having a bit of a shortage of medical personnel in some parts of Canada due to a variety of reasons (the demographic shift of the Baby Boomers getting older has put an unexpected strain on the medical profession that the governments are working to rectify, sometimes there are a shortage of residency spots for new doctors, and so on), but again the governments are working on it. 

But since the 1960s very few people in Canada (to the best of my knowledge none but I am leaving myself some wiggle room by not saying that there has been no one) has gone bankrupt from medical bills. Depending on the province that you live in (it varies a little from province to province), when you register your income taxes it is measured against a progressive tax scale which determines your healthcare premiums (so if you make below a certain amount, as most university students do, you don't pay anything) and it goes up in increments from there (in British Columbia I think the cut off is 22,000 CAD when you need to start paying medical premiums - plus most universities include health insurance in the students tuition payments). But again it varies from province to province - some provinces don't have health care premiums (they don't need it).

There are political parties in Canada that are trying to expand medicare to include prescription drugs so that the government can use its bulk buying power to make agreements with the pharmaceutical companies to bring prices down. It is an on going debate but it is incrementally moving in that direction. 
Why do so many people cross the border to get healthcare in America if yours is so good?
There is no government data on this unfortunately, but according to this Washington Post article it seems most of the people who go to the States go for “medically necessary elective treatment,” - in short, non-critical procedures that have less priority. But again, the data is incomplete as there is information on the raw number of people going to the States, but not their motivations or for what procedures. It may be a case of people being unwilling to wait for procedures, it may be a case of the better specialist is in the States. We don't know. All I know is that Canadian hospitals are not Soviet-style monstrosities that some claim them to be.

This is weeks old, from Shapiro's feed.
That doesn’t sound good for anyone . . .
The point is to keep the media in a frenzy over it.

Of course he would be impeached if he actually did it.
if a President has the ability to pardon himself, it needs to be changed to where they cant.
The only way he can be prosecuted for any crime is by his impeachment being voted in the House of Representatives.

The President having the power to "pardon himself" is just a law problem for the entertainment of lawyers, since the Executive doesn't have the power to indict or prosecute the President anyway.

The Constitution reserves that power to Congress.

It's this way to avoid the DoJ having power over the President instead of the other way around.

But if you have nothing to hide or are not a criminal  why worry silly.
I think people have caught on and become numb to the media created "conflicts". The fact is, there is much more positive than negative when it comes to his presidency. People might not get his sarcasm and many think he should get off of Twitter, but if any democratic president accomplished what he has done so far in their first year the headlines would be completely different.

They don't like the truth.  Liberalism is a mental disease and all that is required is ignorance and hypocrisy.
I think the problem your going to see with this is first everything this article is is factually correct. 

The problem lies in philosophy not fact. It’s a philosophical point of view that your a criminal for breaking a law. Not everyone sees it that way. 

It’s the one part of the Republican platform I don’t like... the law and order crowd. 

If you feel laws are for the guidance of the wise and the obedience of fools is a different philosophy from laws are for the obedience of the wise and guidance of fools. 

So yes the Democrats and Trump are both right and both wrong depending on your philosophy. Not facts! 
Like the [success of the economy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jun/19/markets-slide-trump-threatens-china-200bn-tariffs-business-live?CMP=twt_gu)? The lack of action or empathy to mass shooting victims and their families? The condemnation of military widowed when his predecessors left things to the chain of command or sent letters of thanks? The [support of a foreign corporation convicted of espionage and violating sanctions against North Korea](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/387723-schiff-trump-deal-with-zte-a-violation-of-the-emoluments-clause), even [despite his own party's wishes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/us/politics/senate-zte-trump.html)?

I will grant you one thing, if a democratic president [violated the emoluments clause](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-emoluments-lawsuit.html?partner=IFTTT) of the constitution, they would leap on the chance to impeach.

I'm willing to grant credit where credit is due, but what successes are directly his? His claim that the [safety of 2017 air traffic](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/01/02/airline-safety-sets-record-2017-trump-claims-credit/996561001/) entirely left his field of influence.
Trying to enter our country illegally and the complaining about the treatment you receive is asinine.  If I broke in to yourself and then complained about my turds clogging your toilet will you be so understanding?

Some things politically there is a right and a wrong, this one is one of those things.  "Think about the kids" is for those who don't understand the importance of the rule of law or the basic economics of those in our country who are citizens and need help versus people we owe nothing to that are trying to free load.  Grow a pair and make a stance.

President trump needed every toss up and lean dem to go his way in the election so it isn’t impossible for dems to get the senate. That is why it is important to go out and vote straight republican. I normally don’t even in local elections vote straight republican but the way the dems have acted I am going republican all down the ballot

Nice to get an honest telling of what's going on. And although she wanted to steer the conversation, I gotta giver her respect for not talking over him when he started saying things she wasn't expecting. 
That's strange, I want everyone to be free to make their own decisions as long as they don't infringe on the rights of others. I guess that makes me a nazi now? Add that to the other bucket of things I am according to Democrats, and I'm a 1% sexist racist redneck nazi with white privilege that is bought out by AT&amp;T because net neutrality muh feelz. There's gotta be a scholarship for that somewhere.
We're definitely not only 1%. Silent majority. 
Congratulations.  You just alienated every single Democrat and independent that opposes illegal immigration by calling them Nazi's.  

The left has gone full retard on the immigration issue.  I just don't get it.  **They lost this debate last election.** "Build the Wall" was literally the mantra of the Trump campaign.  At the end of the day, you're never going to win an election against a populist like Trump if you're campaigning on helping foreigners while Trump is campaigning on helping Americans.  That's just a no-brainer for most people.
Wait, you mean the liberals lied about something again to further their political agenda? Who woulda thunk!

"we Democrats". I die a little inside seeing Lincoln say that.
Demtards are infuriated by the fact that we’re winning so they do what any 5 year old would , lash out . 
I don't understand how people can listen to this woman and cheer her on.  Some of her statements are just plain false. Saying that she never called for Trump's impeachment and telling a crowd of people that Putin is advancing into North Korea.  It's scary because her and her listeners believe this.

The Republicans needs to keep campaigning for messaging and information purposes. The public must know there are alternatives. If they fall completely out of the public eye and idea they present will be considered radical.
Would Roberts vote for it or do we need to replace a liberal justice?
He should, he definitely knows better, but I'd prefer to wait until Ginsburg or Breyer are replaced before finding out. 
Look at his opinion on Obamacare, 'preserving the sanctity of the Court's nonsense.
That's why I'd prefer for one of the 4 liberals to be replaced first, but John Roberts is a very smart guy who definitely knows better. 
This headline is misleading. That was already the rule 40 years ago in the *Abood* case that just got overturned.

Mrs Rosanne Barr didn't have anything to say. Launched and piggybacked his career through a celebrity and now is acting like one.
How do you want a rational discussion when you post a far left opinion piece on a Republican sub?  

Your understanding of Republicans is pretty short sighted as well.  We consume media and news the same as every one else does.  We don't just watch Fox News.  What echo chamber are you living in to have such an ignorant view of Republicans?
I understand that The Washington Post is left leaning.  But the trip happened.  Show me a Right or centrist article describing the trip and tell me your thoughts on it.  
Of course the trip happened.  The U.S. Ambassador to Russia has an annual Independence Day Party at their residence.  

https://www.google.com/amp/thehill.com/homenews/senate/395719-gop-senators-visited-moscow-on-july-4%3famp

Why do you fill your head with opinion pieces from left wing zealots?  What good does that bring to your life?

Dude this Russia stuff sounds just like pizzagate or Obama was born in Kenya. Can you see that? Both side of the “aisle” as you so elegantly put it are pretty much the same if you go far enough to the edges.
I can but Russia did meddle in our election.  That’s a fact. Pizzagate and Kenya are not.  As far as I see it, Russia is enemy #1 and I just wanted to hear the Republican thoughts on the trip.
I am a registered I as well. You are not looking for political discourse this garbage is sensationalist at best. You want my opinion who cares Russia is a big farce and even if it wasn’t it kept Hillary and the democrats from getting elected and further ruining this country
I saw the article on r/politics.  That sub leans left so I asked for the republican opinion and now you’re saying that Russia meddling in our election is a good thing because you got what you wanted.  This time.  And you’re an American? You sound like a bot.  
Leans left..... you just stated r/politics leans left. You are dense and yes countries meddle in our elections all the time. The European Union is threatening tariffs on goods coming from red states in an attempt to put pressure on republicans through the midterm elections to stop trumps trade war. But I don’t think you have a problem with that do you? And I would take anything to stop the democrats from gaining power again the last eight years were the most miserable years in America’s existence if Egypt meddled in our elections just to keep the dems out I would shake their hand

The World Cup is happening in Russia from June 14th to July 15th.

One of my best friends is a Russian American, gg bois.
What is the over/under that the winner is investated for colluding with Putin?
Pizzagate and Kenya are both true. 
Very, veeery unlikely.

You can rig who gets to host the tournament, but rigging the tournament itself is next to impossible.

Even more now with instant replay added.
But Russian trolls can apparently do anything. They're magicians. 
I didn't mean what are the chances that they ACTUALLY collude and rig it, I meant the chances that they get BLAMED for it. You know if the wrong person wins someone will blame Russia.

Good! They don't need to be made feel welcome anywhere near Trump. 
Unfortunately it doesn’t change the conversation any. In Portland there was a guy who was a Sanders supporter and was kicked out when he trie to join a pro-Trump rally for being too racist. When he shot a couple of people while acting racist Republicans still got the blame and the mayor tried to revoke a pro-Trump rally permit. 

Still have to keep making them feel unwelcome though. Even if the media ignores it.

How is allowing Russia to meddle in our elections and doing nothing to prevent it in the future diplomacy? If Trump had a real discussion about it with Putin, that would be diplomacy. All he did was say that he trusted Putin over our own intelligence and proceed to compliment him. How is this issue any closer to being solved?

I cannot comprehend such a high level of english.
I think the outrage part comes from the face that if someone is watching the video on Facebook, they are probably not too smart. They don't understand that the video is satire, so they just point to it as evidence of how dumb the left is. 

I understand that it is intended as satire, and as such I find it funny, just like when Colbert or Stewart makes fun of the right. However, much of the intended audience probably didn't see it as satire. I know most of my conservative Facebook friends wouldn't. And to be fair, that isn't exactly CRTV's problem, unless they shared the video in the hope of it being misleading.

several reasons. 

1) they want to do "art" and "be free", but are forced to get a job or a useless degree. it infuriates them. not all are born conscientious. 

2) people from toxic households develop pathological guilt and pathological altruism. therefore they can't understand how someone can earn a lot of money and not feel guilt over it - and assume these people then must be psycopaths - dehumanize and tear down, right?

3) they latch onto the first seductive philosophy they come across - apparently socialism or postmodernism is still wild and strong.

Apparently, Anti-ICE Protesters are way more dicks than actual ICE-officers. As I expected, protesters way more aggressive,stupid and they don't know what harm they cause to the other people by being "helpful  and kind to immigrants".

P.S I am immigrant from Belarus(Eastern Europe), so I don't need that "Typical white nazi trash" or anything else you wanted to say.
Disgusting leftist scum. How low can they go. I thought they stooped low enough repeatedly calling that ICE officer a n***** and spitting on him the other day, now they're harassing a food truck that raises money to feed the homeless? What a bunch of scum
Hey, I'm an immigrant from Eastern Europe too! I immigrated here from the USSR when I was 5 years old. I can't stand these leftists. They're basically trying to bring what we fled from into this country.

She's not a leftist.  She's deranged.  That I can say both sides have en masse.
But why do you say she's not a leftist?
I guess you could call this left but of all the lib's I know, none of them are like this.  This is just plain crazy.  I guess in my mind, it's like the far left trying to make the KKK represent all conservatives when anyone with common sense knows it's a far reach to do so.  A few, sure, but I wouldn't place them in the same group.  Same thinking goes towards this person.
There were a ton of these “not leftists” at Charlottesville protesting a few stupid white supremacists. This is the left.
I think this why its important to differentiate between "liberal" and "leftist"
I agree.  I was thinking liberal but instead was smacked in the face with insanity and couldn't think straight.  That video is absurd.

He is so out of touch I don’t even know what to say 
There’s been times when I think the man is an idiot for some of his ideologies but I don’t ever recall questioning the man as an American. This country was built on the idea of allowing disagreements and continuing to allow them. The Republicans won the civil war and allowed the democrats to come back and have a voice. Could you see that if (I know big if) today’s democrats won a war?

People on the View should all be fired the way Roseanne Barr was. They say things a hell of a lot worse than Roseanne even on television! They even say such horrible things and speculations about the President. However, they are on a liberal channel, so whatever they say about Trump faces no consequences. If people said half the things about Obama that people say about Trump it would be racist, etc. Disgusting that such hypocrisy in this world. You didn't see Republicans so but hurt about stupid Obama winning. Yet, leave it to the damn democrats to cause such a fuss over everything.
And she's running unopposed apparently. If the Republicans threw up any scandal free candidate they could win by trashing socialism. Same for New York. Where are the Republican opponents in these districts. Anyone? Bueller?

[removed]
Typical.
[removed]
Thank you for explaining this to me from a perspective of a resistard with an iq of 3.7.

&gt; Republicans are blocking an investigation because they know Kavanaugh is guilty.

This is being blocked because it is a baseless claim perpetuated by worthless resistards like you. Kavanaugh has already received 60+ letters in his defense from former students and has been a virgin many years after high school yet you people are going on to use the stupidest source possible - Stormy Daniels lawyer. 

&gt;Kavanaugh is not calling for an investigation because he knows he is guilty.

Are you really this stupid? He said he wants to have a hearing last Tuesday yet the democrats delayed like typical hypocrites. If you bothered to watch the video you would know this but instead you decide to read reddit news headlines for your information.

&gt; Republicans are not allowing any witnesses except for Ford and Kavanaugh because they know he is guilty.

Why do you need witnesses? If she can’t explain herself in front of the senate then she deserves nothing less than life in jail. BUT MUH WITNESSES!!1!!1!1!

I didn’t expect someone who praises a dumbass like Mueller is capable of watching this video.
done
Why is this being downvoted and that retarded deleted comment being upvoted? Ban those people from the sub. Everything OP says here is true. The "the republicans knows he's guilty" argument is honestly one of the most deranged and retarded replies I've EVER heard because literally no republican thinks he's guilty.
Done! Curious as to see if you find anything interesting. what was the inspiration? 
He looks so distraught. The whole interview they look super sad. I cant imagine going through all this. They dont deserve it.

Where did you see that he in fact exposed himself at a party? From what I saw Deborah Ramirez accused him in the article and then in the same article also said she can’t be certain it was him?
And then that idiot senator proceeded to tell him he didn’t believe “boofing” means flatulence.
I think it's a good outcome because reps get votes and dems feel like they're more in control which usually makes them easier to work with. I think they'll stick with the week time period. If they don't, they won't be able to count on being reelected. The one thing I'm concerned about is the radical left now knows they only have 1 week to permanently screw Kav, and his family's, life.

More alarmist nonsense from the MSM. The IPCC has been drawing lines in the sand for years, all of which have come and gone because there's no basis for their hysteria. No wonder then that we're seeing the same thing this time around and the media continues to lap it up and regurgitate it.
Where’s the fancy parades, man?
Sue me.

 Philosemites are the west's doom, jews are consistently responsible for the largest problems from demographic replacement to SJWS back to incessant mid east war, Jews are up both sides ass destroying us and they suck at hiding themselves and their intentions.

They are an idiotic and uneducated minority while CNN is mainstream news that hundreds or thousands of people watch at a given time
I didn't see a call for civil war. The article doesn't even provide a call for civil war. To end civility, yes, for war not so much.

Everyone needs to be civil though.

Well the problem is due to those Democrats and their silly policy. 
&gt; Setmayer replied, calling Walker "intellectually dishonest" for his support of Trump, who she says are "literally bullies [and] insults people as POTUS."

A self-proclaimed conservative on CNN doesn't support the republican POTUS because he's a "bully"? That doesn't sound like any conservative to me. We don't base such opinions off emotion. Talk about "intellectual dishonesty", idiots like her can't make an argument, thus have to toss around a new buzzword she learned.

Is this really the important news we’re embracing?  Elizabeth Warren shouldn’t have made her stupid announcement, but tons of Twitter heads shouldn’t have decided THIS is the issue to jump on.  It’s stupid, childish, and irrelevant.  

The whole article is just sixth grade mocking done by adults.  This isn’t polotics, my friends.  This is immaturity by the people we are trusting to run this country.

Shouldn’t we expect our representative in media and politics to represent us with some level of decorum?

Just my opinion.
Betcha they find her silk screen printer and dozens of T-shirts with misprints. 
Watch the Democrat Harley Rouda complain like a baby that Congressman Dana Rohrabacher "has notes" in front of him... Oh the horror! Proving that Democrats are simply babies.

You sure?  This is a good one!
From my understanding Puerto Rico has been plagued with corruption for a long time. I think they really should push for statehood. 
u/officialpepethefrog generalized the shameful moment of one Democrat to all Democrats, proving Republicans are simply hyperbolic finger pointers.

Dems don't want to admit it but we are being invaded.
Genetics will solve the issue, either you have a Y chromosome or not.
&gt;psychologytoday.com/us/blo...

From the article: "The Trump administration says they will use [genetics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/genetics) to determine a person’s gender when the anatomy is not clear. They are likely under the wrong impression that all people have XY or XX chromosomes or that people’s chromosomes invariably define their gender. What will they do with the people who have chromosomal mosaicism, a condition in which some of their cells have XY chromosomes and others have XX chromosomes? People with another condition called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome have XY chromosomes but lack receptors that respond to [testosterone](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/testosterone). They have breasts and vaginas and almost always identify as women. Does the administration plan on telling them that they are actually, in fact, men?"
I am familiar with Trisomy, my step daughter had Trisomy 13, and other genetic conditions.  The group you are trying to push this for never asked for it, and the people who abuse it are the reason it is happening.  

Most of those people with Trisomy rarely live long enough for this to matter.  Trying to make this about hedge science is a joke, and trying to make it about a small group of people who mostly die before they can even consume alcohol legally is equally absurd.

Your two examples compose less than 0.5% of the population *combined*.  At that level, case by case review is warranted, and sufficient.  Giving people a free pass to sexually identify as an attack helicopter otherwise is atrocious.
Also in the article: Somewhere between [one in 1,500](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23296159) and [one in 4,500 infants](https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/intersex.pdf) are born with non-binary external genitalia. This means there are as many as 200,000 such people in the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

Trisomy is a completely unrelated topic. Trisomy 13 involves having three of chromosome 13. Chromosome 13 is not a sex chromosome.
I guess you just ignored what I said before?

EDIT: I read the article, citing it back to me is not going to change my mind.

I stand with you President Trump!! Let's protect our borders and Enforce the Law!!
Let’s hope 
So if the republicans control the house, senate and presidency.  Why is it so hard for him to pass a law.   Namely, stopping 10k immigrants from barging through the southern border?

Yeah, none of those people have seats on the line and none of the easily detected "bombs" even exploded, not one. At least make it believable.

Edit: lol didn't expect this sub to get brigaded but it has. This was always the most low energy of rightwing subs, but they are so desperate they've come here of all places. Pathetic.
Barley a peep? It's all over the place

Dont want to end up like the EU
Why isn't that that it's said Democratics want to keep black depending on government hand outs but there are more whites on welfare then blacks.
mirin arms 
Same as it ever was. Malcolm X said the same thing in 1964:  
&gt; In this present administration they have in the House of Representatives 257 Democrats to only 177 Republicans. They control two-thirds of the House vote. Why can't they pass something that will help you and me? In the Senate, there are 67 senators who are of the Democratic Party. Only 33 of them are Republicans. Why, the Democrats have got the government sewed up, and you're the one who sewed it up for them. And what have they given you for it? Four years in office, and just now getting around to some civil-rights legislation. Just now, after everything else is gone, out of the way, they're going to sit down now and play with you all summer long -- the same old giant con game that they call filibuster. All those are in cahoots together. Don't you ever think they're not in cahoots together, for the man that is heading the civil-rights filibuster is a man from Georgia named Richard Russell. When Johnson became president, the first man he asked for when he got back to Washington, D.C., was "Dicky" -- that's how tight they are. That's his boy, that's his pal, that's his buddy. But they're playing that old con game. One of them makes believe he's for you, and he's got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you, he never has to keep his promise.

&gt;So it's time in 1964 to wake up. And when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy, let them know your eyes are open. And let them know you -- something else that's wide open too. It's got to be the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet. If you're afraid to use an expression like that, you should get on out of the country; you should get back in the cotton patch; you should get back in the alley. They get all the Negro vote, and after they get it, the Negro gets nothing in return. All they did when they got to Washington was give a few big Negroes big jobs. Those big Negroes didn't need big jobs, they already had jobs. That's camouflage, that's trickery, that's treachery, window-dressing. I'm not trying to knock out the Democrats for the Republicans. We'll get to them in a minute. But it is true; you put the Democrats first and the Democrats put you last.
This must have been at the end. The crowd shouting abuse at the press pit was much larger when I saw it. 
It is a big problem that people equate ratings with newsworthiness.

It reminded me of the shoe bomber or underwear bomber.  Demented and sad...probably mentally ill.  Yes, it is serious enough to respond because that is the job, but equivalent to “clickbait” if reported as a 9/11 equivalent or compared.

Embarrassing for CNN!
Serious if we fail to respond.  So blatant in its disregard for our border, allowing them in would be disastrous for border security and create a much bigger future problem.  

Trump is correct to take this seriously and see issues if allowed. 
If you’ve ever wandered why some people don’t like Republicans, it’s because of stuff like this. I haven’t even watched the video but the title picture is Ben Shapiro and Toni Lahren saying “you’re stupid.”  What if we at least tried to appear open minded. 
This is literally the only thing the military is suppose to be used for.

The military isn't border control. This is not what the military should be used for. Further I see this ending very badly.

That one student is literally calling for something more than just the defacement of property through graffiti. I would not be surprised if the school has riots soon because the 'tolerant' left wants to show that they don't promote violence.
Couldn't agree more. Big shapiro fan, but it's annoying to see every video suggestion with an obnoxious thumbnail and a title about someone ABSOLUTELY DESTROYING someone.

Same like every Anti-Trump YouTuber, just makes jokes and hopes you don’t research further than their YouTube channel. Not only do I dislike this man, I don’t trust anything a leftie has to say. Trump has done us right on many things to the point where I know he is doing the right thing for all of us.
14th Amendment says otherwise.
